Abstract = {Research has demonstrated that residential yards can provide important
   habitat for urban birds, pollinators, and other wildlife. In addition,
   the motivations and constraints underlying decisions to manage
   traditional lawns, water-conserving yards, native plants, and other
   landscape types are well understood. Yet relatively little research has
   addressed people's decisions to adopt wildlife-supporting yards.
   Analyzing survey data from six U.S. cities, we address three related
   questions: 1) to what extent do residents choose yard features that
   support wildlife habitat?; 2) how do yard priorities and neighborhood
   governance, along with socio-demographic factors, explain the adoption
   of wildlife-supporting features?; and 3) how do residents who have
   already adopted wildlife-supporting yard features differ in their
   motivations from those who plan to adopt such features and those who do
   not? We found significant potential for adding vegetation (specifically
   shrubs and native plants) and other wildlife-supporting features to
   increase yard complexity and vegetation diversity. While gardening as a
   hobby was a significant motivator for people who have adopted wildlife
   yard features, the desire for low maintenance yards is a constraint
   among non-adopters. We therefore recommend promoting the planting of
   low-maintenance plant species or varieties that provide wildlife habitat
   but require little upkeep, especially among residents who would like to
   attract wildlife to their yards into the future. We also found that
   neighbourhood and homeowner associations increase the local adoption of
   wildlife-supporting yards. Coupled with other findings, our results
   underscore the importance of tailoring residential landscape features to
   diverse lifestyles while leveraging social institutions to expand
   wildlife habitat across urban and suburban neighborhoods.},

Abstract = {Although the yard is a hybrid social and material landscape, much social
   science research emphasizes the socio-cultural factors and has mostly
   neglected the potentially important influence of plants, animals, and
   the nonliving material world on homeowners' decision-making. Using
   interviews across six metropolitan areas in the United States, we
   investigated the ways residential yards' nonhuman context is perceived
   to influence homeowners' relationships with and planning for their
   yards. We found that nonhuman dynamics establish boundaries of
   yard-related decision-making, and that homeowners described their
   relations with the nonhuman context of the yard as cooperative,
   oppositional, and negotiable. We call for social science in urban spaces
   to be more explicitly informed by a consideration of nonhuman agency,
   and offer an ethical reflection of who or what is considered to have a
   right to cohabitate in homeowners' yards.},

Title = {Formative audience research to increase consumer demand for professional
   wildlife-friendly landscape maintenance},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {90},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Greenspace in residential landscapes meets human needs, connects people
   with nature, and supports wildlife and biodiversity. However, some
   landscape maintenance practices are detrimental to wildlife and
   components of their habitat. We conducted a cross-sectional study to
   understand consumer knowledge, the extent of existing demand, and
   barriers related to wildlife-friendly landscape maintenance practices.
   An electronic survey was employed to collect data among Florida
   residents who were at least 18 years old and had a lawn or landscape for
   which they made decisions regarding maintenance. Non-probability opt-in
   sampling was used to recruit participants. Altogether 2101 residents
   completed the survey, among which 1053 indicated they hired green
   industry professionals for some aspects of landscape maintenance.
   Residents were least knowledgeable (M +/- S.D. = 2.82 +/- 1.17) about
   when to apply products like pesticides to yard/planting areas to
   minimize harm to wildlife whereas they were most knowledgeable (M +/-
   S.D. = 3.32 +/- 1.16) about how to read pesticide labels when measured
   on a five-point Likert-type scale. The frequency of demand for 56
   wildlife-friendly landscape maintenance practices varied from most of
   the time to half of the time on a five-point Likert-type scale.
   Consumers agreed homeowner association restrictions, lack of knowledge,
   lack of awareness, lack of labeling on plants, and associated costs were
   some major barriers to their engagement in wildlife-friendly
   landscaping. It is recommended to work on reducing these perceived
   barriers among residents and increasing rewards with interventions like
   education, pledges, and financial incentives among others to increase
   demand for landscape maintenance services that support wildlife.},

Title = {Why garden for wildlife? Social and ecological drivers, motivations and
   barriers for biodiversity management in residential landscapes},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {258-273},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Residential landscapes with private gardens are major land covers in
   cities and their sustainable management is paramount for achieving a
   resilient urban future. Here we focus on the value of residential
   ecosystems for biodiversity conservation and explore the social and
   ecological factors that influence wildlife-friendly garden management.
   Using a stratified sampling design across the UK city of Leeds, this
   interdisciplinary study develops and applies a mixed method approach,
   including questionnaires, interviews and ecological surveys across
   multiple spatial scales. We quantify wildlife-friendly gardening using
   two measures: (i) the number of wildlife-friendly features within
   gardens (the wildlife resources index, WRI); and (ii) the frequency of
   winter bird feeding. Wildlife-friendly gardening is influenced by a
   combination of garden characteristics and management intensity,
   householder demographics, wider environmental activity and landscape
   context. Residents reveal a range of motivations for wildlife-friendly
   gardening, notably personal well-being and a moral responsibility to
   nature. Respondents expressed a duty to maintain neighbourhood
   standards, revealing that social norms are a considerable barrier to
   uptake of wildlife-friendly activities, but also provide an opportunity
   where neighbour mimicry results in diffusion of wildlife-friendly
   practices. Community-driven initiatives that engage, educate and empower
   residents are better placed to encourage wildlife-friendly gardening
   than top-down financial incentives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   wildlife: evidence from citizen scientists in a global biodiversity
   hotspot},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 18},
Abstract = {Private gardens comprise a large component of greenspace in cities and
   can offer substantial conservation opportunities. There has been strong
   advocacy from researchers, policymakers, and conservation practitioners
   to engage householders in wildlife-friendly gardening practices to
   increase the quantity, quality and connection of habitat resources for
   urban wildlife. Despite this call to action, there remains limited
   knowledge on the use and benefit of some wildlife-friendly structures
   within gardens, such as artificial refuges and water sources. In
   collaboration with 131 citizen scientists in southwestern Australia, we
   examined the use of seven wildlife-friendly structure types by four
   vertebrate taxa groups. Following 2841 wildlife surveys undertaken
   between 31 July 2022 and 22 February 2023, we found that all structures
   were used primarily by target taxa, water sources were often used by
   relatively common species, certain structures such as possum shelters
   were used by rare and threatened species (e.g. western ringtail possum),
   and that there was evidence of animals making use of the
   wildlife-friendly structures for reproduction (e.g. bird eggs in nest
   boxes and tadpoles in water sources). Water sources were used more
   frequently and by a greater diversity of wildlife than artificial
   refuges. In particular, bird baths were used by the highest number of
   species (mainly birds) while ponds were used by the greatest variety of
   taxa (birds, reptiles, frogs, mammals). Our findings provide
   evidence-based support for the advocacy of wildlife-friendly gardening
   practices and further highlight the role of residential gardens for
   biodiversity conservation.},

   Wildlife Activity},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Wildlife are increasingly being found in urban habitats, and likely rely
   on some resources in suburban household yards, which exposes them to the
   effects of yard management and human and pet activities. We compared the
   relationships between these potential disturbances and benefits to the
   number of different types of wildlife sighted by householders, using
   written surveys. Owing to the inability of many household respondents to
   identify animals to the species or genus level, each different `type' of
   animal individually listed was counted to generate the total number of
   types of wildlife observed by each household. We found that relatively
   more types of wildlife were observed by residents whose yards provided
   ease of faunal access under or through fences, had reduced pesticide
   use, increased levels of anthropogenic noise, and increased presence of
   pets in yards. The latter two associations likely relate to the
   increased opportunities to observe wildlife in yards that each creates.
   We also investigated the use of yards by wildlife and domestic pets in
   open compared to more vegetated habitats by day and night, using
   motion-sensor cameras. All animals observed were compared to the
   activity of introduced brown and black rats (Rattus norvegicus, R.
   rattus), owing to their wild origins but long commensal history with
   humans. Camera images indicated that animals' natural activity periods
   were maintained in yards. Brown antechinuses (Antechinus stuartii),
   northern brown bandicoots (Isoodon macrourus), domestic cats (Felis
   catus) and native birds (species as listed below) each preferred
   sheltered or vegetated habitats over open habitats, when compared to the
   introduced rats that showed little habitat preference. However, unlike
   the other species, the native birds used open areas more than vegetated
   or sheltered areas when compared within their group only. The common
   brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) was observed to use open areas
   comparatively more than the introduced rats, but used vegetated or
   sheltered habitats more when compared to self only. The domestic dog
   (Canis familiaris) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) used open areas more than
   vegetated or sheltered areas, when compared to the introduced rats, and
   against themselves. This indicated a level of coping with urban
   stressors by the native animals, but with a reliance on more vegetated
   habitats to allow for natural stress-relieving behaviours of escape or
   hiding. Here, we offer insights into how each of these findings may be
   used to help educate and motivate increased household responsibility for
   urban wildlife conservation.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {The human footprint is rapidly expanding, and wildlife habitat is
   continuously being converted to human residential properties. Surviving
   wildlife that reside in developing areas are displaced to nearby
   undeveloped areas. However, some animals can co-exist with humans and
   acquire the necessary resources (food, water, shelter) within the human
   environment. This ability to coexist may be particularly true when
   development is low intensity, as in residential suburban yards. Yards
   are individually managed ``greenspaces{''} that can provide a range of
   food (e.g., bird feeders, compost, gardens), water (bird baths and
   garden ponds), and shelter (e.g., brush-piles, outbuildings) resources
   and are surrounded by varying landscape cover. To evaluate which
   residential landscape and yard features influence the richness and
   diversity of mammalian herbivores and mesopredators; we deployed
   wildlife game cameras throughout Northwestern Arkansas, USA in 46
   residential yards in summer 2021 and 96 yards in summer 2022. We found
   that mesopredator diversity had a negative relationship with fences and
   was positively influenced by the number of bird feeders present in a
   yard. Mesopredator richness increased with the amount of forest within
   400 m of the camera. Herbivore diversity and richness were positively
   correlated to the area of forest within 400 m surrounding yard and by
   garden area within yards, respectively. Our results suggest that while
   landscape does play a role in the presence of wildlife in a residential
   area, homeowners also have agency over the richness and diversity of
   mammals using their yards based on the features they create or maintain
   on their properties.},

Abstract = {Two consequences of the continued urbanisation of the human population
   are that a growing proportion of the landscape is less hospitable to,
   and that a growing proportion of people are disconnected from, native
   biodiversity. One response of the UK government has been to establish a
   goal, and an associated baseline indicator, of increasing the extent and
   range of public participation in gardening for wildlife. The formulation
   of policy to attain this end requires, however, insight into the factors
   that are associated with the level of participation. Here we examine the
   relationships, across 15 areas in five UK cities, between the proportion
   of households providing various garden features for wildlife or
   participating in various wildlife gardening activities, and housing
   densities and characteristics of the garden resource. We show that
   significant numbers of households participate in some form of wildlife
   gardening, but that the predominant form this participation takes is
   feeding wild birds. Key variables associated with spatial variation in
   wildlife gardening activities are the proportion of households with
   access to a garden and, more importantly, average garden size and the
   proportion of land cover by gardens. There was no evidence for strong
   effects of household density or the socio-economic status of
   householders on the prevalence of wildlife friendly features in gardens
   or on the participation by householders in activities to encourage
   wildlife. Our results suggest important considerations in attempts to
   increase awareness and participation in wildlife gardening.},

Abstract = {Animals from urban areas are regularly brought into wildlife

   inform management of wildlife species. Although rescues may be
   considered a wildlife stewardship behavior, not all `rescues' may be
   warranted. Some animals are more likely to be brought into a rescue

   rehabilitation efforts are important to understand for urban
   conservation efforts. Literature has primarily focused on understanding
   the ecological drivers and implications of wildlife rescues. Our study
   is the first to investigate both the social and ecological drivers of
   bird rescues using census, household survey, and intake data. In Phoenix
   metropolitan area, Arizona, USA in 2017-2018, we found doves and common
   species were sent to the center most often. Altricial species (helpless
   at hatching) and young birds were more likely to be brought to the
   center, perhaps due to perceptions of young animals as vulnerable. We
   found rescues came from neighborhoods with higher incomes and residents
   with pro-ecological worldviews, perhaps reflecting a perceived
   responsibility for wildlife. Conversely, few rescues came from
   neighborhoods with a high percentage of Hispanic/Latinx residents, who
   often feel more interdependent with nature. Neighborhoods with greater
   numbers of rescues were more likely to have residents participating in
   yard stewardship activities as compared to neighborhoods with fewer
   rescues. Our findings are relevant to understanding drivers of wildlife
   stewardship actions and for intake centers who wish to reduce the
   occurrence of people bringing in wildlife that do not need to be

Abstract = {A diversity of indigenous and alien wildlife persists in suburbia, and
   provides residents with the opportunity to experience wildlife. Suburban
   gardens may serve as refugia and foraging grounds for many primate
   species allowing them to populate within a largely urbanized landscape.
   However, this has led to the increasing human interactions with them,
   resulting in conflict. Our study investigated the perceptions of
   suburban residents towards urban vervet monkeys Cercopithecus aethiops
   pygerythrus within the Msunduzi and Ethekwini municipalities,
   KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We assessed how these related to the
   monkeys' presence, activities and interactions in residential gardens,
   and the value of wildlife to residents. Assessment was conducted through
   an online questionnaire survey. General attitudes of residents to vervet
   monkeys were canvassed by assessing the respondents' level of active
   engagement in wildlife watching within their properties. We analyzed 603
   surveys submitted online using logistic regression and ordinal
   regression models. We ascertained that vervet monkeys were disliked by
   29\% of residents due to their aggressiveness, destructive behaviour in
   gardens and households, and perceived threat to native wildlife.
   Frequency and duration of foraging vervet monkeys in residents' gardens
   was influenced by the presence of pet dogs, fruiting trees, tall trees
   (> 2 m), ratio of indigenous to alien vegetation of gardens, residency
   type, and active and passive food provisioning. Despite conflict, the
   majority of respondents appreciated urban wildlife (67\%) and actively
   engaged in wildlife watching (88\%), emphasizing the importance of
   incorporating human dimension values into the management of urban
   biodiversity. Our study highlights the value of citizen science in
   providing mechanisms for identifying priority management and
   conservation efforts at the highly complex human-wildlife interface in

Abstract = {Within the expanding city of Brisbane in south-east Queensland, numerous
   fragments of native and regrowth vegetation are scattered across the
   largely urbanised landscape. These fragments provide refuge to a great
   diversity of native wildlife, and, provide residents with the
   opportunity to experience nature on their doorstep. To assess the
   diversity and abundance of this wildlife, recent changes in these
   parameters, and the value of wildlife and bushland fragments to
   residents of Brisbane, a questionnaire survey was distributed to 300
   households each located adjacent to one of 38 urban bushland fragments.
   A total of 172 surveys (57\%) were returned, producing 768 records of 83
   fauna species, dominated by birds and mammals; bandicoots were widely
   reported from the 38 fragments. Several historical records provided
   evidence of recent local extinctions within fragments, highlighting the
   continuing declines in various species of native wildlife within
   Brisbane. Several human-wildlife conflicts were identified, but overall
   residents were tolerant of such conflicts. Bandicoots were disliked by a
   small minority (3\%) of residents owing to the holes they dig in lawns
   and gardens in search of food. and their potential as vectors of ticks.
   Most respondents expressed ail appreciation for the presence of native
   wildlife (96\%) and bushland fragments (97\%) in their local area,
   emphasising the importance of incorporating human dimension values into
   the management of this urban biodiversity.},

Title = {Different social drivers, including perceptions of urban wildlife,
   explain the ecological resources in residential landscapes},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {401-413},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Context The conservation value of residential landscapes is becoming
   increasingly apparent in our urbanizing world. The ecological
   characteristics of residential areas are largely determined by the
   decisions of many individual ``managers.{''} In these complex
   socio-ecological systems, it is important to understand the factors that
   motivate human decision-making.
   Objectives Our first objective was to quantify wildlife resources and
   management activities in residential landscapes and compare vegetation
   in front and back yards. Our second objective was to test three
   hypotheses linked with variation in yards: socioeconomic
   characteristics, neighborhood design factors, and perceptions of
   neighborhood birds.
   Methods We conducted surveys of over 900 residents in 25 Chicago-area
   neighborhoods to examine the wildlife resources contained in front and
   back yards and the social factors associated with variation in yards. We
   used a multi-scalar approach to examine among-yard and
   among-neighborhood variation in residential landscapes.
   Results Results indicate that back yards contain more wildlife resources
   than front yards, including greater vegetation complexity, more plants
   with fruit/berries, and more plants intended to attract birds.
   Furthermore, different hypotheses explain variation in front and back
   yards. Perceptions of birds were most important in explaining variation
   in back yard vegetation and wildlife-friendly resources per parcel,
   while neighbors' yards and socioeconomic characteristics best explained
   front yard vegetation.
   Conclusions This study demonstrates the importance of back yards as an
   unexplored and underestimated resource for biodiversity. In addition,
   the results provide insight into the complex factors linked with yard
   decisions, notably that residents' connections with neighborhood birds
   appear to translate to on-the-ground actions.},

Title = {Contradiction and Complacency Shape Attitudes towards the Toll of Roads
   on Wildlife},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary: Mitigating the toll of roads on wildlife can become
   difficult when awareness and exposure does not result in willingness to
   change driving behaviour. Using a self-reporting questionnaire, we found
   that while most drivers view wildlife vehicle collisions as a serious
   issue, increasing exposure to collisions decreased this attitude and it
   did not translate into willingness to adopt additional mitigation
   strategies. In addition, despite most respondents stating they routinely
   drive slower when collision risk is high (at dusk and dawn), our
   assessment of driving trends via traffic speeds suggested this sentiment
   was not generally adhered to. We suggest that competing priorities and
   complacency when risk to people is low may adversely affect willingness
   to prevent collisions.
   Abstract: Most people in the world now live in cities. Urbanisation
   simultaneously isolates people from nature and contributes to
   biodiversity decline. As cities expand, suburban development and the
   road infrastructure to support them widens their impact on wildlife.
   Even so, urban communities, especially those on the peri-urban fringe,
   endeavour to support biodiversity through wildlife friendly gardens,
   green spaces and corridors, and conservation estates. On one hand, many
   who live on city fringes do so because they enjoy proximity to nature,
   however, the ever increasing intrusion of roads leads to conflict with
   wildlife. Trauma (usually fatal) to wildlife and (usually emotional and
   financial) to people ensues. Exposure to this trauma, therefore, should
   inform attitudes towards wildlife vehicle collisions (WVC) and be linked
   to willingness to reduce risk of further WVC. While there is good
   anecdotal evidence for this response, competing priorities and better
   understanding of the likelihood of human injury or fatalities, as
   opposed to wildlife fatalities, may confound this trend. In this paper
   we sought to explore this relationship with a quantitative study of
   driver behaviour and attitudes to WVC from a cohort of residents and
   visitors who drive through a peri-urban reserve (Royal National Park) on
   the outskirts of Sydney, Australia. We distributed a self-reporting
   questionnaire and received responses from 105 local residents and 51
   visitors to small townships accessed by roads through the national park.
   We sought the respondents' exposure to WVC, their evasive actions in an
   impending WVC, their attitudes to wildlife fatalities, their strategies
   to reduce the risk of WVC, and their willingness to adopt new
   ameliorative measures. The results were partitioned by driver
   demographics and residency. Residents were generally well informed about
   mitigation strategies but exposure led to a decrease in viewing WVC as
   very serious. In addition, despite most respondents stating they
   routinely drive slower when collision risk is high (at dusk and dawn),
   our assessment of driving trends via traffic speeds suggested this
   sentiment was not generally adhered to. Thus we unveil some of the
   complexities in tackling driver's willingness to act on reducing risk of
   WVC, particularly when risk of human trauma is low.},

Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1389-1403},

Abstract = {Human-wildlife conflict is increasing as urbanization expands and
   wildlife species adjust to living near people. Translocation is often
   used to manage human-wildlife conflict because it is considered to be
   humane, yet fates of translocated animals are largely unknown. As an
   urban adapter, woodchucks (Marmota monax) are a common source of
   human-wildlife conflict due to their burrowing, foraging, and
   scent-marking behavior. We examined survival and movements of 27
   nuisance woodchucks captured by a nuisance wildlife operator in the
   Chicago metropolitan area, radiomarked with internal transmitters, and
   translocated to exurban release sites mimicking typical practices. We
   also captured and radiomarked 16 resident woodchucks from the release
   landscape for comparison. Translocated woodchucks moved farther than
   residents immediately post release with no evidence of homing and most
   left the release site. Annual survival did not differ between
   translocated and resident woodchucks. However, survival was extremely
   low (0.18) compared to previous estimates for woodchucks, primarily due
   to high predation by coyotes (Canis latrans). Translocation should be
   used only when other nonlethal methods are ineffective (e.g., exclusion,
   removing food sources, selecting unpalatable plants for gardens). When
   necessary, the practice of translocation could be improved by reducing
   predation risk for translocated animals, either by selecting release
   sites with low predation risk, or by using soft-release methods, such as
   acclimation enclosures or artificial burrows.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {373},
Number = {1745},

Abstract = {Many human populations are undergoing an extinction of experience, with
   a progressive decline in interactions with nature. This is a consequence
   both of a loss of opportunity for, and orientation towards, such
   experiences. The trend is of concern in part because interactions with
   nature can be good for human health and wellbeing. One potential means
   of redressing these losses is through the intentional provision of
   resources to increase wildlife populations in close proximity to people,
   thereby increasing the potential for positive human-nature experiences,
   and thence the array of benefits that can result. In this paper, we
   review the evidence that these resource subsidies have such a cascade of
   effects. In some Westernized countries, the scale of provision is
   extraordinarily high, and doubtless leads to both positive and negative
   impacts for wildlife. In turn, these impacts often lead to more
   frequent, reliable and closer human-nature interactions, with a greater
   variety of species. The consequences for human wellbeing remain poorly
   understood, although benefits documented in the context of human-nature
   interactions more broadly seem likely to apply. There are also some
   important feedback loops that need to be better characterized if
   resource provisioning is to contribute effectively towards averting the
   extinction of experience.

Abstract = {Several organizations run wildlife-gardening programs designed to
   mitigate the biodiversity loss and disconnect between humans and
   wildlife that commonly accompanies urbanization. The National Audubon
   Society runs the Plants for Birds and the Humminbirds at Home programs
   that, like others, recommend homeowners to establish diverse assemblages

   hummingbird data from the Hummingbirds at Home program to determine
   whether common wildlife-gardening recommendations correlate with
   intended outcomes. Our results showed that, after statistically

   sightings during patch surveys was positively related to the (1)
   presence of hummingbird feeders in a patch, (2) number of

   nectar-provisioning flowering-plants in a patch were endemic to the
   conterminous USA, and (4) lack of impervious surface (a common proxy for

   previous studies that showed how recommendations from wildlife-gardening

Abstract = {The negative impacts of urbanization on biodiversity are well known, and

Title = {Wildlife gardening initiates a feedback loop to reverse the ``extinction

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {289},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Urbanization can cause the ``extinction of experience{''}, a feedback
   loop in which people who have little interaction with nature are less
   likely to protect it. This cycle could result in a continual erosion of
   biodiversity and fewer opportunities for people to experience nature.
   Alternatively, a sustainable version of this loop may occur which
   incorporates environmental engagement, or ``noticing nature.{''} Here we
   combine ecological and social data to provide the first empirical test
   of the full extinction of experience/noticing nature loop, using birds
   as a focal taxon. Our study included 815 urban residents from 25
   neighborhoods near Chicago, IL (USA). Residents were asked about their
   yard management and perceptions of birds in their neighborhoods. A
   researcher also documented the neighborhood bird communities. The social
   and ecological data were incorporated into a structural equation model
   to test the existence of a feedback loop. Our data confirm the existence
   of a loop but indicate that the relationship between people and birds is
   indirect rather than direct, suggesting that biodiversity changes are
   less important in the loop than residents' impressions of biodiversity.
   This is promising for urban conservation, because it suggests the cycle
   may continue even when the scale of management in an individual yard
   does not match the scale necessary for an immediate impact on wildlife.
   We therefore suggest that small wildlife-friendly changes to residential
   yards, in the aggregate, have the potential to reverse the extinction of
   experience and promote long-term increases in biodiversity.},

Title = {An underrated habitat: Residential gardens support similar mammal

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {250},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urban environments offer substantial opportunities for wildlife
   conservation as they commonly overlap the distribution of native species
   and comprise structurally complex and diverse habitats. Conservation
   strategies within urban environments currently focus on enhancing or
   maintaining natural remnant vegetation despite the variety of smaller
   greenspaces that are known to support wildlife. Residential gardens in
   particular comprise a major component of the total greenspace in urban
   areas and offer numerous resources that can be used by multiple taxa,
   and may therefore represent an important, yet unrealised opportunity for
   conservation. In this study we aimed to further the understanding of the
   potential value of gardens for biodiversity conservation by comparing
   the diversity, presence, abundance and reproductive activity of mammals
   in gardens to natural urban bushland remnants. We demonstrate that
   gardens support a similar diversity of native mammals as urban bushland
   and that the presence, abundance and reproductive activity for most
   native mammals was similar in both bushland and gardens. With the
   exception of domestic pets, the presence and abundance of introduced
   species was not higher in gardens compared to urban bushland. Our study
   highlights that the potential role of residential gardens for
   biodiversity conservation should not be overlooked. Given that novel
   urban ecosystems will continue to expand, inclusion of gardens in
   wildlife conservation and management actions is likely to greatly
   increase our ability to conserve wildlife in urban habitats.},

Title = {Biodiversity conservation in urban gardens - Pets and garden design
   influence activity of a vulnerable digging mammal},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Residential gardens can provide essential opportunities for native
   wildlife and represent a valuable way of creating new habitats.
   Bandicoots (marsupial family Peramelidae) are medium-sized digging
   mammals that play a valuable role in maintaining ecosystem health;
   retaining these important ecosystem engineers across urban landscapes,
   including in private gardens, can have enormous conservation benefits.
   Urbanisation is a significant threat for some bandicoot species, and
   therefore understanding the factors associated with their activity can
   help guide urban landscape and garden design. To identify key features
   associated with the activity of a local endemic bandicoot species, the
   quenda (Isoodon fusciventer), we carried out a camera trap survey of
   front and back yards for 65 residential properties in the City of
   Mandurah, Western Australia. We compared quenda activity with biotic and
   abiotic factors that could indicate potential predation risk (activity
   of domestic dogs Canis familiaris and cats Felis catus, and the presence
   of artificial or natural protective cover), food availability (including
   deliberate or inadvertent supplementary feeding, provision of water, and
   diggable surfaces) and garden acces-sibility (distance to bushland,
   permeability of boundary fencing, and garden position). Supplementary
   feeding was strongly associated with quenda activity. Quenda were also
   more active in back yards, and in gardens where there was greater
   vegetation cover. Of concern, quenda activity was positively associated
   with cat activity, which could reflect that straying pet cats are
   attracted to gardens that harbour wildlife populations, including
   quenda. Furthermore, almost half of the gardens showed cat activity
   despite only a small sample of the surveyed residents owning a pet cat.
   Results of this study can help guide the design of residential gardens
   to increase useful habitat for these important digging mammals.
   Vegetation, wood mulch and semi-permeable fencing can provide valu-able
   resources needed to support the persistence of quendas across the
   rapidly changing urban landscape mosaic, where natural and managed
   (e.g., gardens and parks) green spaces are becoming less common and more
   isolated.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Interactions with nature can improve the wellbeing of urban residents
   and increase their interest in biodiversity. Many places within cities
   offer opportunities for people to interact with wildlife, including open
   space and residential yards and gardens, but little is known about which
   places within a city people use to observe wildlife. In this study, we
   used publicly available spatial data on people's observations of birds
   from three online platforms-eBird, iNaturalist, and Flickr-to determine
   where people observe birds within the city of Chicago, Illinois (USA).
   Specifically, we investigated whether land use or neighborhood
   demographics explained where people observe birds. We expected that more
   observations would occur in open spaces, and especially conservation
   areas, than land uses where people tend to spend more time, but
   biodiversity is often lower (e.g., residential land). We also expected
   that more populated neighborhoods and those with higher median age and
   income of residents would have more bird observations recorded online.
   We found that bird observations occurred more often in open spaces than
   in residential areas, with high proportions of observations in
   recreation areas. In addition, a linear regression model showed that
   neighborhoods with higher median incomes, those with larger populations,
   and those located closer to Lake Michigan had more bird observations
   recorded online. These results have implications for conservation and
   environmental education efforts in Chicago and demonstrate the potential

Abstract = {The primary threat to biodiversity is habitat loss and degradation.
   Private residential land (yards) encompass large proportions of urban,
   suburban, and rural spaces and is among the most rapidly expanding
   systems on Earth. Yards also represent a conservation opportunity to
   provide wildlife habitat, support biodiversity, restore ecosystem
   function and ecosystem services, and increase local opportunities for
   people to connect with nature. In the present article, we propose a
   humanity for habitat stewardship practice by synthesizing the
   evidence-based yard management actions that can advance the conservation
   value of yards, with a focus on benefits to biodiversity, climate
   resiliency, and people. The magnitude and extent of yard management
   might differ, depending on the region, specific management practices,
   the yard's size, and the yard's location along the urban to rural
   gradient. We detail opportunities, challenges, and strategies for
   encouraging stronger public participation in conservation through yard
   stewardship to facilitate biodiversity-friendly residential landscapes
   that benefit wildlife and people.},

   conservation and highly valued under COVID lockdown},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {226},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urbanization is increasing globally, with concomitant negative effects
   on biodiversity and human well-being. In urban areas, gardens may
   contribute to overall green space, bringing benefits to wildlife and
   residents. We used a community science approach to gather data and
   understand the role of urban gardens for wildlife and for residents in a
   developing country, where information on the subject is scarce. We
   evaluated how local characteristics and landscape quality influenced the
   presence of three native birds and two insect species as indicators of
   habitat conservation value, in a town immersed in an Argentinean
   National Park. We also estimated gardens' value during COVID-19
   quarantine to assess whether owners appreciated them more when outdoor
   activities were not allowed, increasing awareness of the value of nature
   for well-being. We found that most respondents enjoy birdwatching in
   their gardens and consider birds as beneficial; however, the pleasure of
   observing insects is lower. The relevance of local garden
   characteristics differed according to the species in question,
   highlighting the importance of using different species as indicators to
   assess garden conservation value. The proportion of tree cover
   surrounding the gardens had a positive effect on the probability of
   finding birds and insects, while the proportion of built-up area had a
   negative effect. During COVID-19 lockdown, most respondents enjoyed
   their gardens equally or more than usual, and those that assigned a
   monetary value to gardens, chose the highest one. We encouraged
   initiatives that engage, inform and empower residents on
   wildlife-friendly gardening to favor the inclusion of gardens as part of
   wider conservation and urban planning strategies.},

Pages = {45-52},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Urbanization along the eastern seaboard of Australia has increased the
   potential for conflict between humans and wildlife. The northern suburbs
   of Sydney are home to the southern brown (Isoodon obesulus) and the
   long-nosed bandicoot (Perameles nasuta). Both are known to enter yards
   of home owners causing a disturbance to yard plantings and an
   interaction with domestic pets. Understanding the driving factors behind
   the public's perception of bandicoots will enable wildlife managers to
   develop effective and socially acceptable conservation strategies. Six
   hundred and thirty questionnaires were distributed to the residents
   bordering Ku-ring-gai Chase and Garigal National Park in Sydney,
   Australia, to assess the sources of conflict. Eighty-three percent of
   respondents had experienced bandicoot interactions and 27\% had
   experienced interactions on a daily basis. This interaction with
   bandicoots influenced respondents' perception of a bandicoot as a
   nuisance or pest. The age of the resident and pet ownership status also
   influenced respondents' attitudes. Contrary to anecdotal reports, there
   was an overall positive response from the community. The information
   gained from this survey will inform the development community-based
   management strategies for the bandicoots of northern Sydney.},

Title = {Does Use of Backyard Resources Explain the Abundance of Urban Wildlife?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {While urbanization is clearly contributing to biodiversity loss, certain
   wildlife assemblages can paradoxically be diverse and abundant in
   moderately developed areas. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is
   that abundant anthropogenic resources for wildlife (i.e., food and
   shelter) outweigh the costs associated with urbanization. To test this
   hypothesis, we used camera traps to measure mammal species richness,
   diversity, and relative abundance (i.e., detection rate) in 58
   residential yards in Raleigh, North Carolina, focusing on six types of
   features that might be used as resources: animal feeding, vegetable
   gardens, compost piles, chicken coops, brushpiles, and water sources. We
   also placed cameras at random control sites within each yard and sampled
   forests in nearby suburban and rural areas for comparison. We fit
   mixed-effects Poisson models to determine whether yard features,
   yard-scale characteristics, or landscape-scale landcover predicted
   mammal relative abundance for eight species. We also tested if the
   relative abundance of native canid predators in yards was related to the
   number of prey (rodents and lagomorphs). Species richness, diversity,
   and relative abundance of most mammal species was higher in yards and
   suburban forests than in rural forests. Within a yard, purposeful
   feeding had the strongest effect on animal relative abundance, with
   eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) being the most common
   (32.3 squirrels/day at feeders; 0.55 at control sites; 0.29 in suburban
   forests; and 0.10 in rural forests). We observed species using (e.g.,
   eating) most yard features, although canids were less likely than other
   taxa to use resources in yards. The presence of a yard feature did not
   strongly affect the abundance of species at the control site in the
   yard, suggesting the influence of these features was highly localized.
   The relative abundance of predators had a positive association with prey
   relative abundance, and predators were less common in yards with fences.
   These results demonstrate that there is high use of anthropogenic
   resources, especially supplemental feeding by urban wildlife, and this
   increase in prey species may then attract predators, which supports the
   hypothesis that use of supplemental food resources explains the
   abundance of urban wildlife.},

Abstract = {The expansion of coyotes (Canis latrans) into the northeastern United
   States is a major challenge to wildlife professionals, especially in
   suburban and urban areas where reports of human coyote interaction (HCI)
   are on the rise. To assist wildlife professionals in identifying
   potential hot spots of interaction and homeowners in evaluating their
   risk of a backyard encounter, we used the techniques of citizen science
   to build a landscape model of HCI for suburban residential properties in
   Westchester County, New York, USA. We distributed surveys via school
   children (kindergarten to grade 12) as part of a voluntary class
   assignment, to maximize the number of homeowners participating in our
   study and to provide learning experiences for students. Of 6,000 surveys
   distributed to schools, >1,500 students interviewed their parents on
   whether a coyote had been seen or heard on their property from 2003 to
   2006. Although surveys could not be distributed randomly owing to the
   participatory process of individual schools, we did receive responses
   from across Westchester County, representing the spectrum from the most
   rural to the most urban towns. Homeowners who encountered (i.e., seen or
   heard) a coyote on their property were on average 50\% closer to forest,
   36\% closer to grassland, and 66\% farther from medium- to
   high-intensity development, complementing existing knowledge on urban
   coyote habitat use. Our model seemed robust in predicting an independent
   set of coyote observations (r = 0.88). Based on this model, we generated
   a map describing the probability of HCI that can be used by both
   wildlife professionals and homeowners. Regarding the former, state
   wildlife agencies could more precisely target education campaigns on how
   to live with coyotes where the possibility of HCI was greatest.
   Homeowners, in turn, could evaluate their own risk and modify behaviors
   that would make their property less attractive to coyotes. Furthermore,
   in creating a descriptive model of HCI from citizen-generated data, we
   demonstrated how citizen science can be a useful exploratory tool,
   generating a wealth of data over a large geographic area in a short
   period, especially when the inquest is appropriate to stakeholder
   participation in data collection.},

Abstract = {Natural areas in cities are important refugia for wildlife, but some
   species also use developed areas. Such adaptation may be facilitated at
   the ecotone between natural and residential areas where wildlife
   encounter anthropogenic resources. We quantified human activities and
   objects that potentially attract coyotes (Canis latrans) by providing
   shelter, food, prey habitat, and novelty items where backyards back onto
   natural areas in Edmonton, Canada. We related attractant abundance and
   human demographic variables to coyote access to backyards, scat
   abundance, and the number and nature of reports detailing interactions
   with coyotes near the ecotone. Among 468 surveyed backyards, 31\% were
   accessed by coyotes, and we detected 2055 instances of attractants.
   Coyotes selectively accessed unfenced backyards with food and novelty
   items, and backyard access was most common along transects where fences
   were infrequent, and shelter was abundant. Evidence of deer on transects
   was weakly correlated with increased prevalence of scats. Public reports
   describing conflict with coyotes were more frequent in areas with more
   coyote access to backyards, fewer fences, and more shelter. Weak
   evidence indicated that food abundance, scat prevalence, and backyard
   access were higher in areas with larger houses and more
   university-educated and retired residents. These results suggest that
   coyotes frequently access attractants at the ecotone between natural and
   residential areas, which may promote habituation, food conditioning, and
   human-wildlife conflict. These effects could be reduced, and coexistence
   could be promoted with clearer boundaries separating natural and
   residential areas, opposing conventional recommendations for reserve
   design that encourage gradual transition zones.},

   stewardship programs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {292},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Despite growing interest in promoting urban biodiversity conservation,
   there are few concrete examples of how nature stewardship initiatives
   can be rapidly scaled, in number and across landscapes. This paper
   explores the factors that promote or inhibit the proliferation and
   impact of collaborations between citizens and their local governments
   that involve residents in municipal biodiversity conservation efforts in
   their gardens (wildlife gardening). We studied the Gardens for Wildlife
   Victoria network in Australia, which supports citizen-agency
   codevelopment of municipal wildlife gardening programs. In three years
   the network has expanded from one program to 39 initiatives in various
   developmental stages in 49\% of the local government areas in the state
   of Victoria. Data are drawn from 21 semi-structured interviews of
   network participants running or developing programs in 12
   municipalities, complemented by a survey of 33 network participants, and
   participants' evaluation of network workshops. We find that scaling
   occurs in four different domains of policy, values, locales and
   participants. Scaling is influenced by six interlinked factors:
   empowerment of actors; a civil-agency co-design and delivery model;
   conservation framing; links to and between landscapes and communities;
   resources - particularly time; and the network's role in promoting
   innovation and shared learning. Key barriers include short-term,
   topdown, and monetary agency foci; conservation framed as the principal
   domain of specialists and professionals; and prioritisation of listed
   species rather than local species more broadly. We present a framework
   for considering scaling of biodiversity stewardship and related factors.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Cities are important sites for encouraging more widespread adoption of
   pro-environmental behaviors (PEB) that benefit humans and wildlife
   alike. Wildscaping, a type of stewardship PEB in which people create
   wildlife friendly gardens, has been promoted by conservation
   organizations, yet fundamental questions remain about what wildscaping
   entails and what factors contribute to sustained involvement. We used a
   social-ecological systems (SES) framework to examine behavior change
   among urban residents in Colorado who had received wildscape gardening
   certification and training. We employed semi-structured interviews (n =
   11), quantitative surveys (n = 63), participant observation, and
   document analysis, and analyzed data using grounded theoretical
   techniques. We found that program participants engaged in 14 gardening
   behaviors targeting habitat creation on their properties, and 11
   advocacy behaviors targeting social change. These behaviors were driven
   by 10 interconnected motivations, including mutual refuge with wildlife,
   changing norms, aesthetic beauty, and sense of place. Engagement in
   wildscaping was sustained over time by multi-scalar contextual factors,
   including social interactions and formal program participation. These
   findings offer the first SES understanding of how urban residents begin
   and expand their engagement in wildscape gardening and advocacy. Future
   research should focus on how understanding of SES characteristics can
   enable more effective behavior change programs in urban landscapes.
   Possible ways that conservation outreach could consider SES include
   encouraging evolving feedback loops between participants' motivations
   and behaviors, emphasizing reciprocal benefits to individuals and their
   social-ecological context, and promoting coordinated involvement by
   different types of actors at multiple scales of the system.},

Title = {Amenity migrants, animals and ambivalent natures: More-than-human
   encounters at home in the rural residential estate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {262-272},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In light of increased development pressure in rural landscapes,
   understanding how amenity migrants understand and experience nature is a
   vital project for rural studies. This paper investigates how residents
   living in a rural residential estate (RRE) negotiate more-than-human
   encounters in domestic settings. RREs are emergent forms of
   master-planned residential development on the rural urban fringe,
   marketed and designed to meet an idyllic rural lifestyle. In the RRE,
   domestic nonhuman transgressions are both presumed as a part of the
   amenity migrant experience, and pre-empted by estate design and
   regulation. Border encounters in gardens were explored via
   semi-structured walking interviews with 27 residents of an RRE, located
   on the rural urban fringe of Sydney, Australia. Nonhuman transgressions
   were found to both contribute towards, and challenge, homemaking
   practices. Some residents expressed a vernacular ecology at home
   entangled with more-than-human company, where nonhumans are
   `neighbours'. Gardens were shared, and maintenance practices altered.
   When domestic expectations of cleanliness and order were challenged,
   native nonhumans were negotiated in gardens with a `hoped-for absence'
   (Ginn, 2014). These stories illustrate that a native politics of
   belonging foreshadows the homemaking practices of amenity migrants. The
   paper suggests settlements similar to RRE can be a positive intervention
   on the rural urban fringe, encouraging different registers of
   interaction with nonhuman nature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Human dimensions research can help resource and wildlife managers make
   informed decisions, target information efforts, and gain a greater
   understanding of the factors that comprise attitudes toward wildlife
   management efforts. Despite these often-stated merits, studies
   addressing the human dimensions of resource and wildlife management
   efforts are rare in Europe. A proposed restoration of free-ranging
   European bison (Bison bonasus) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, has
   presented an opportunity to help address this research gap. During May
   to July 2006, we used a randomly distributed, self-administered
   questionnaire (n = 398) to assess local residents' attitudes, beliefs,
   and levels of support or opposition toward the proposed restoration.
   These factors were compared across two administrative regions spanned by
   the proposed restoration area. We found that respondents from the
   Siegen-Wittgenstein region held significantly more positive attitudes
   and significantly higher knowledge levels than respondents from the
   Hochsauerlandkreis region. Principal components analysis revealed that
   attitudes comprised a general attitude factor pertaining to issues such
   as the importance of conserving bison for future generations and a
   lifestyle impact factor, which included items pertaining to bison-caused
   damages to trees and crops. Logistic regression was used to show the
   influence of fear of bison on attitudes. We discuss the likely causes
   and management implications of our findings and provide suggestions to
   managers wishing to target information efforts and address the concerns
   of those affected by the proposed restoration.},

Abstract = {In sprawling metropolitan areas, residential landscaping is a major
   concern with respect to biodiversity conservation, and it could play a
   critical role in conserving wildlife habitat. In the United States,
   residential landscaping typically consists of maintained lawns with
   specimen plantings of non-native trees and shrubs; such designs provide
   poor habitat for urban wildlife species. We conducted a case study of
   Raleigh, North Carolina residents to determine how providing information
   about the benefits of native plant landscaping to bird species
   influenced urban residents' landscaping preferences. We used Wilcoxon
   Signed Rank tests to determine if respondent preferences for 0, 50, 75
   and 100 \% native plant landscaping coverages changed after residents
   were informed about the benefits that native plants provide for birds.
   Initially, the 50 \% native landscaping coverage was most preferred by
   residents; however, preferences for all four native plant landscaping
   coverage designs were significantly different after the informational
   treatment. Neutrality changed to opposition for the 0 \% native plant
   coverage, while opposition changed to support and neutrality for the 75
   and 100 \% native plant coverage designs, respectively. After the
   informational treatment, the 50 and 75 \% native plant landscaping
   coverage had the highest mean preference levels, although the 100 \%
   design was ranked first more than any other design. Our findings suggest
   that residential support for native plant landscaping is higher than is
   reflected by typical residential landscaping practices, and that
   dissemination of information regarding the benefits of native plant
   landscaping to birds could alter public preferences for native plant
   landscaping.},

Title = {Achieving positive social outcomes through participatory urban wildlife
   conservation projects},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Pages = {607-617},
Abstract = {Context As urbanisation continues to increase on a global scale, people
   are becoming increasingly distanced from nature. Fewer opportunities to
   encounter nature mean that the benefits of engaging with nature are
   often not realised by urban residents. In response to this, there is a
   growing number of initiatives that aim to connect people with nature,
   for the benefit of individuals, communities and nature conservation.
   However, in order to maximise these benefits, it is important to
   understand the potential transformative effects for participants, both
   on a personal level and in terms of wider impacts.
   Aims In this study, we evaluate the social outcomes of a participatory
   wildlife conservation project in an urban area in north-east England,
   using hedgehogs as the focal species.
   Methods Based on an approach of community volunteers working alongside
   scientific researchers in an evaluation of hedgehog urban habitat use,
   we examine the transformative effects of this involvement at the
   individual and community levels via qualitative semi-structured
   interviews with community volunteers.
   Key results Participants were motivated by personal wellbeing factors
   such as enjoying proximity to the study species, learning and social
   factors. Participation in the study itself indicates a degree of
   motivation for engaging with a study of this sort. Nevertheless,
   involvement in the study was a successful vehicle for increasing
   participants' engagement with nature both during the study and
   potentially into the future, particularly in terms of biological
   recording and gardening for wildlife.
   Conclusions Participation in a wildlife study is a positive experience
   for many volunteers, leading to actual and potential changes in both
   personal and wider social outcomes.
   Implications Participatory initiatives such as the one described have an
   important role to play in signposting and supporting volunteers to
   follow future environmental aspirations and maximise the personal and
   social benefits associated with participation. This could be enhanced by
   ensuring that volunteering opportunities are linked in with pre-existing
   community-based networks that can act as advocates for environmental and
   wildlife conservation.},

Abstract = {The high valuation of urban green spaces is obvious, given the lost
   economic opportunities their preservation requires. With more and more
   of the world's human population moving to urban areas, experiences with
   urban wildlife are becoming increasingly important for maintenance of
   people's connection to and concern for the natural world. Turtle
   watching provides an opportunity to connect urban residents with
   charismatic species that engender positive aesthetic responses from the
   public. In Erie, Pennsylvania, the Presque Isle Partnership is a
   nonprofit organization dedicated to enhancing visitor experiences at
   Presque Isle State Park. The park is a sandspit peninsula on Lake Erie
   that has abundant turtle populations in its sheltered bays and interior
   wetlands, particularly its populations of the common map turtle,
   Graptemys geographica. The common map turtles of Graveyard Pond have
   long been one of the park's signature wildlife spectacles. A basking
   aggregation that can exceed 100 turtles in late spring and early fall is
   enjoyed by visitors to a shoreline picnic area, canoeists, kayakers, and
   guests on the park's pontoon boat tours. In 2012, the Partnership funded
   construction of a handicapped-accessible turtle observation deck with
   fixed binocular viewfinders and informative signage. Total material cost
   for the project was \$20,466 (similar to\$22,922 in 2020 US dollars);
   labor for construction was donated by local industry. Since its
   construction, the observation deck has become a popular stop for park
   visitors. Similar projects would be suitable for many urban areas in the
   United States and many other countries with watchable turtle populations
   and would enhance urban residents' encounters with urban turtle
   populations.},

Title = {Retrofitting streetlights with LEDs has limited impacts on urban

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {254},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Artificial light at night (ALAN) causes a wide range of ecological
   impacts across diverse ecosystems. Most concentrated in urban areas,
   ALAN poses a particular risk to associated wildlife by disrupting
   physiology, behaviour and ultimately survival. This risk is predicted to
   shift as nighttime lightscapes in many cities undergo change. Globally,
   streetlights are currently being retrofitted with newer technologies
   that differ in the spectrum and intensity of their emissions, but there
   is a dearth of in situ urban experiments on the ecological impacts of
   this change. We monitored timing of dawn and dusk bird song; frequency
   of owl vocalisations; avian diversity, relative abundance and community
   composition; small invasive mammal and ground insect activity; and
   invertebrate relative abundance at 26 residential properties over an
   18-month period that coincided with a retrofit from high-pressure sodium
   (HPS) to white light-emitting diode (LED) streetlights. Initiation time
   of dawn song was advanced or delayed for two bird species following the
   retrofit and backyard avian community composition was altered. Avian
   species richness, relative abundances of three bird species and ground
   insect activity increased in the presence of LED streetlights. No other
   retrofit effects were found. Our study suggests that retrofitting
   streetlights with white LEDs may lead to both positive and negative
   conservation outcomes for urban wildlife, but direct impacts are
   relatively small and may be mitigated by changes in lighting
   characteristics, such as dimming. Streetlight retrofits could provide an
   opportunity to reduce the impacts of ALAN on urban wildlife if
   intentionally designed with conservation benefits in mind.},

Title = {Closing the Gap: Communicating to Change Gardening Practices in Support
   of Native Biodiversity in Urban Private Gardens},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Private gardens collectively comprise the largest green space in most
   cities and the greatest potential for increasing the extent of
   wildlife-friendly and native-dominated habitat, improving the quality of
   ecosystem services, and providing opportunities for urban dwellers to
   reconnect with nature. Because attitudes and values driving landscape
   preferences in gardens are complex and often not conducive to
   biodiversity, and a gap exists between the possession of knowledge or
   values and the expression of pro-environmental behavior, facilitating
   change in gardening behavior is challenging. We attempted to improve
   knowledge and influence values, attitudes, and gardening behavior of 55
   householders in favor of native biodiversity and environmentally
   friendly practices, through a two-way communication process, or
   interactive dialog, during a process of biodiversity documentation of
   their gardens. Informative feedback on their garden with a normative
   component was also provided. Despite being well educated and
   knowledgeable about common species at the start of the study, an
   increase in knowledge and shift in attitude was detected in 64\% of
   householders: 40\% reported a greater understanding of wildlife, and
   26\% made changes in their gardens, 13\% to support native biodiversity.
   The normative component of our feedback information was of particular
   interest to 20\% of householders. Because neighborhood norms influence
   gardening practices, changes adopted by a proportion of householders
   should be perpetuated across neighborhoods. The process of biodiversity
   assessment, dialog, and feedback was effective in improving knowledge of
   wildlife and native species, and stimulated a shift in attitude that
   resulted in native-friendly gardening practices. These changes were
   detected primarily through open self-report questions, rather than
   quantitative measures.},

Abstract = {Many stressors plague bee populations including habitat fragmentation
   and degradation, as well as pathogens and pesticide exposure. With bee
   communities at risk, conservation efforts are imperative. Although
   recent research has examined bee communities across cities, few studies
   have analyzed variation in human attitudes toward and perceptions of
   bees, or how these perspectives might influence bee conservation. We
   therefore analyzed residents' attitudes toward and perceptions of bees,
   specifically in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. Primarily drawing upon
   2017 survey data (n = 496, 39\% response rate), we posed the following
   questions: 1) What cognitive, environmental, and social factors explain
   whether people like or dislike bees? and 2) How do attitudes and
   perceptions about bees relate to land management practices, specifically
   landscaping choices, herbicide and pesticide use, and desert plantings?
   Overall, attitudes toward bees were mostly neutral with a slight trend
   toward dislike but most residents did not believe bees were problematic
   at their homes. Additional findings reveal that risk perceptions,
   ecological worldviews, and pet ownership significantly explained
   attitudes toward bees. Moreover, people who live closer to desert parks
   had relatively positive attitudes toward bees. Regarding yard management
   practices, both attitudes toward and perceptions of bees were positively
   correlated with adding desert plants to residential yards. Moreover,
   people who use pesticides had more negative attitudes toward bees. Our
   results indicate conservation potential for urban bee populations, for
   example, by planting native vegetation in residential areas near desert
   preserves. We hope this study will result in more attitudinal research
   on bee species and other understudied urban wildlife.},

Title = {Woody cover does not promote activity of nest predators in residential
   yards},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {32-39},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Urban development often affects resource availability in ways that can
   influence not only community structure, but key species interactions
   that shape population dynamics. Although some resources are
   unintentionally altered, others are deliberately changed to improve
   habitat for urban wildlife, particularly songbirds. We hypothesized that
   management strategies that encourage planting trees and shrubs (i.e.
   increasing woody cover) would inadvertently attract predators of bird
   nests, which are generally abundant within cities. To test this, we
   examined the relationship between percent woody cover, pooled across
   trees and shrubs, and diurnal activity patterns of nest predators in
   residential yards. We surveyed predator activity and characterized
   habitat using aerial imagery of seven suburban neighborhoods in Franklin
   County, Ohio during April-August 2011 and 2012. Predator activity varied
   widely among individual yards, but contrary to our hypothesis, the
   availability of woody cover at either yard or neighborhood scales was
   not a strong predictor of diurnal activity in yards for five common
   species of nest predators (Eastern gray squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis;
   common grackle, Quiscalus quiscala; brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus
   ater; blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata; and domestic cat, Fells catus).
   Thus, our study suggests that wildlife habitat management or gardening
   programs that recommend increasing woody cover do not necessarily
   attract some common predators of songbird nests in Midwestern
   landscapes. Additional research that identifies which habitat features
   beyond woody cover best predict nest predator activity will facilitate
   the creation of management recommendations that increase the
   conservation value of urban environments for songbirds. (C) 2014

Title = {Managing gardens for wildlife: Features that predict mammal presence and
   abundance in gardens vary seasonally},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Residential gardens in urban areas offer substantial opportunities for
   biodiversity conservation. To realize this opportunity, a comprehensive
   understanding of which species prosper in gardens, which mechanisms
   promote their use of these green spaces and how these mechanisms can be
   manipulated by residents to achieve conservation outcomes, is needed.
   While substantial progress has been made in evaluating the mechanisms
   that influence the diversity, presence, and abundance of wildlife in
   gardens, how these mechanisms vary seasonally is largely unknown. This
   study investigated whether the garden features influencing the presence
   and/or abundance of arboreal, flying, and ground-dwelling mammals in
   gardens varied seasonally using acoustic, trapping, and spotlighting
   surveys undertaken in four consecutive seasons (2018/19) in 52 gardens
   in southwestern Australia. As animal behavior and resource availability
   varies seasonally, we predicted that garden features influencing the
   presence and abundance of mammals in gardens would also vary seasonally.
   For arboreal and ground-dwelling mammals, we found that some garden
   features (e.g., canopy cover and presence of dogs, respectively) were
   important in more than one season; however, none were important in all
   seasons with most only being influential in one. No garden features
   predicted the presence of flying mammals in more than one season. Our
   results suggest that sampling in a single or few seasons may fail to
   identify features influencing wildlife at times other than in the season
   of sampling, or alternatively, may overemphasize factors that do not
   operate across all seasons. Studies that consider the mechanisms on a
   seasonal basis will provide a more comprehensive list of features
   influencing the presence and abundance of animals in gardens. We suggest
   it is both those features that support wildlife in multiple or all
   seasons, and those that support critical life-history events in a single
   season that could contribute to conservation if manipulated by residents
   appropriately.},

Abstract = {Australia's urban landscapes offer opportunities to marry socio-economic
   and biodiversity conservation objectives. Yet, information is needed on
   what urban landscape and habitat features are important for wildlife. In
   this article, we draw together our research from southeastern Australia
   to describe key lessons for biodiversity-sensitive cities and towns.
   Lesson 1: The effects of urbanization on wildlife extend into adjacent
   habitats. We recommend retaining large, undisturbed areas of habitat
   away from development, avoiding intensive development adjacent to
   important conservation areas, prioritizing areas of ecological and
   social significance, screening light and noise pollution at the urban
   fringe and around large nature reserves, and planting appropriately
   provenanced locally native species for public streetscapes, parks and
   gardens. Lesson 2: Strategic enhancement of urban greenspace offers
   biodiversity gains. We recommend increasing the total amount of
   greenspace cover, maintaining ecological structures as habitat islands,
   using landscaping techniques to minimize risks to human safety, and
   gardening with low-flowering native shrubs. Lesson 3: Large old trees
   need to be managed for long-term sustainability. We recommend retaining
   large old trees in new developments, increasing the maximum standing
   life of urban trees, protecting regenerating areas and planting more
   seedlings, supplementing habitat features associated with large trees,
   and ensuring that young trees have space to grow through time. Lesson 4:
   Education and engagement connects residents with nature and raises

Title = {An assessment of a conservation strategy to increase garden connectivity

   barrier too far?},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Urban areas are associated with high levels of habitat fragmentation.
   For some terrestrial species with limited climbing abilities, property
   boundaries can pose a significant problem by limiting access to
   residential gardens. The West European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus)
   has declined markedly in the UK but is commonly found in areas of human
   habitation, including residential gardens. `Hedgehog Street' is a public
   engagement campaign aimed at recruiting volunteers ('Hedgehog
   Champions') to create access points ('hedgehog highways') across garden
   boundaries to improve habitat connectivity. In this study, we used a
   series of questionnaire surveys to explore motivations for and obstacles
   to the creation of highways. Householders were more likely to have
   created a highway if they were already aware of the Hedgehog Street
   campaign, if their garden contained a high number of wildlife-friendly
   features and if they considered watching wildlife to be important.
   Hedgehog Champions created, on average, 1.69 highways each with 52.0\%
   creating none; this would equate to an estimated >120,000 across all
   registered Champions. In comparison, 6.1-29.8\% of non-Champions stated
   that they had made a highway. However, most highways had been created in
   boundaries that could already be traversed via naturally occurring
   holes: only 11.4\% of garden boundaries could be traversed, and 3.2\% of
   gardens accessed, just via a hedgehog highway. In addition, only 5.0\%
   of gardens were considered totally inaccessible to hedgehogs. The most
   common reasons cited for not having made a highway were that
   householders' gardens were already accessible to hedgehogs followed by
   concerns relating to boundary ownership and / or communicating with
   neighbours. Future studies need to identify strategies for overcoming
   these obstacles to maximize citizen engagement, particularly with those
   householders who are not innately ``wildlife-friendly{''}, and to
   quantify the degree to which networks of highways affect patterns of
   individual movement and, ultimately, populations.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is recognized as one of the greatest threats to
   biodiversity throughout the world. However, the vegetation within an
   urbanized landscape is diverse and includes a variety of native and
   exotic plant species. This variation allows for testing whether certain
   landscape designs outperform others in the support of native
   biodiversity. Residential yards represent a large component of an urban
   landscape and, if managed collectively for birds and other wildlife,
   could offset some of the negative effects of urbanization. In addition,
   many urbanites have their primary interaction with the natural world in
   their front and back yards. Therefore, ensuring positive wildlife
   experiences for them is essential in promoting urban biodiversity. At
   the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research site we tested
   the efficacy of native landscaping in residential yards in attracting
   native birds. We also explored the links between socioeconomic factors,
   landscape designs, and urban gradient measurements with the urban bird
   communities. A redundancy analysis suggested that native desert bird
   species increased in abundance in neighborhoods with desert landscaping
   designs, neighborhoods closer to large desert tracts, and higher-income
   neighborhoods. Variance partitioning showed that collectively these
   three sets of environmental variables explained almost 50\% of the
   variation in the urban bird community. Results suggested racial and
   economic inequities in access to biodiversity, whereby predominantly
   Hispanic and lower-income neighborhoods had fewer native birds. We also
   found that residents' satisfaction with bird diversity was positively
   correlated with actual bird diversity. Our study provides new insights
   into the relative importance of socioeconomic variables and common urban
   ecological measurements in explaining urban bird communities. Urban
   planners can use this information to develop residential landscapes that
   support the well-being of both birds and people.},

Title = {Testing the Likeable, Therefore Abundant Hypothesis: Bird Species
   Likeability by Urban Residents Varies Significantly with Species Traits},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The urbanization of landscapes filters bird communities to favor
   particular species traits, driven in part by the changes that homeowners
   make to the amount and quality of habitat in yards. We suggest that an
   ultimate driver of these proximate mechanisms underlying bird community
   change with respect to urbanization is the likeability of species traits
   by urban residents. We hypothesize that bird species likeability,
   modulated by species traits, influences the degree to which homeowners
   alter the availability and quality of habitat on their properties and
   thereby affects species population sizes in urbanized landscapes. We
   refer to this new hypothesis as the Likeable, therefore Abundant
   Hypothesis. The Likeable, therefore Abundant Hypothesis predicts that
   (1) bird species likeability varies with species morphological and
   behavioral traits, (2) homeowners use trait-based likeability as a
   motivator to modify habitat availability and quality on their
   properties, and (3) residential habitat availability and quality
   influences species populations at landscape scales. We tested the first
   prediction of the Likeable, therefore Abundant Hypothesis using a survey
   of 298 undergraduate students at the University of North Carolina at
   Charlotte who were asked to rank their preferences for 85 forest
   generalist and edge/open country songbird species grouped according to
   10 morphological and behavioral traits. Survey respondents preferred
   very small, primarily blue or black species that are insectivorous,
   aerial or bark foragers, residents, and culturally unimportant. On the
   other hand, respondents disliked large or very large, primarily yellow
   or orange species that forage on the ground and/or forage by
   flycatching, are migratory, and are culturally important. If the
   Likeable, therefore Abundant Hypothesis is true, natural resource
   managers and planners could capitalize on the high likeability of
   species that are nevertheless negatively affected by urbanization to
   convince homeowners and residents to actively manage their properties
   for species conservation.},

   Biodiversity},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The loss of habitat due to suburban and urban development represents one
   of the greatest threats to biodiversity. Conservation developments have
   emerged as a key player for reconciling new ex-urban residential
   development with ecosystem services. However, as more than half of the
   world population lives in urban and suburban developments, identifying
   conservation partners to facilitate retrofitting existing residential
   neighborhoods becomes paramount. Homeowner associations (HOA) manage a
   significant proportion of residential developments in the United States,
   which includes the landscape design for yards and gardens. These areas
   have the potential to mitigate the loss of urban biodiversity when they
   provide habitat for native wildlife. Therefore, the conditions and
   restrictions imposed upon the homeowner by the HOA could have profound
   effects on the local wildlife habitat. We explored the potential of HOAs
   to promote conservation by synthesizing research from three monitoring
   programs from Phoenix, Arizona. We compared native bird diversity,
   arthropod diversity, and plant diversity between neighborhoods with and
   without a HOA. Neighborhoods belonging to HOAs had significantly greater
   bird and plant diversity, although insect diversity did not differ. The
   institutional framework structuring HOAs, including sanctions for
   enforcement coupled with a predictable maintenance regime that
   introduces regular disturbance, might explain why neighborhoods with a
   HOA had greater bird diversity. For neighborhoods with a HOA, we
   analyzed landscape form and management practices. We linked these
   features with ecological function and suggested how to modify management
   practices by adopting strategies from the Sustainable Sites Initiative,
   an international sustainable landscaping program, to help support
   biodiversity in current and future residential landscapes.},

Title = {Multi-Scalar Drivers of Residential Vegetation Changes in Metropolitan
   Phoenix, Arizona},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 21},
Abstract = {In the arid southwestern U.S., urban greening strategies have been
   promoted to alleviate ecosystem disservices associated with lawns,
   including the adoption of xeric yards with desert-adapted floras and
   gravel groundcover and wildlife-friendly yards with complex vegetation
   structure and composition. Scant studies have investigated the extent of
   different vegetation changes in urban greening practices and the
   complexity of associated human drivers. We addressed this gap by
   analyzing survey data from two survey periods (2017 and 2021) to answer
   the following questions: to what extent have residents from metropolitan
   Phoenix made different vegetation changes in their yards over the last
   decade, and how do multi-scalar human drivers affect different
   vegetation changes? We found a sustainable trajectory for residential
   vegetation changes in Phoenix since mid-2010s, with declining additions
   of grass and increases in trees and desert plants across residential
   neighborhoods. Esthetics was an influential driver of both tree planting
   and native gardening. Additionally, tree planting was associated with
   anthropocentric values (i.e., low-maintenance needs), while desert plant
   additions reflected the appreciation of nature (i.e., attitudes towards
   the desert) and environmental concerns (i.e., supporting wildlife).
   Institutions such as local government programs might shape residents'
   vegetation choices, as tree planting differed among municipalities. We
   also found counterintuitive influences of residential tenure controls on
   landscaping decisions. Specifically, renters were more likely to add
   yard trees compared to homeowners. Our results inform landscape
   sustainability by identifying potential pathways to residential yard
   changes that offer a multitude of services while being appreciated and
   maintained by residents.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urbanization has a homogenizing effect on biodiversity and leads to
   communities with fewer native species and lower conservation value.
   However, few studies have explored whether or how land management by
   urban residents can ameliorate the deleterious effects of this
   homogenization on species composition. We tested the effects of local
   (land management) and neighborhood-scale (impervious surface and tree
   canopy cover) features on breeding bird diversity in six US metropolitan
   areas that differ in regional species pools and climate. We used a
   Bayesian multiregion community model to assess differences in species
   richness, functional guild richness, community turnover, population
   vulnerability, and public interest in each bird community in six land
   management types: two natural area park types (separate and adjacent to
   residential areas), two yard types with conservation features
   (wildlife-certified and water conservation) and two lawn-dominated yard
   types (high- and low-fertilizer application), and surrounding
   neighborhood-scale features. Species richness was higher in yards
   compared with parks; however, parks supported communities with high
   conservation scores while yards supported species of high public
   interest. Bird communities in all land management types were composed of
   primarily native species. Within yard types, species richness was
   strongly and positively associated with neighborhood-scale tree canopy
   cover and negatively associated with impervious surface. At a
   continental scale, community turnover between cities was lowest in yards
   and highest in parks. Within cities, however, turnover was lowest in
   high-fertilizer yards and highest in wildlife-certified yards and parks.
   Our results demonstrate that, across regions, preserving natural areas,
   minimizing impervious surfaces and increasing tree canopy are essential
   strategies to conserve regionally important species. However, yards,
   especially those managed for wildlife support diverse, heterogeneous
   bird communities with high public interest and potential to support
   species of conservation concern. Management approaches that include the
   preservation of protected parks, encourage wildlife-friendly yards and
   acknowledge how public interest in local birds can advance successful
   conservation in American residential landscapes.},

Abstract = {Sugar-water bird feeding in residential backyards is increasingly
   popular, but its effects on wildlife are poorly understood. One concern
   is whether it results in maladaptive behaviour, such as reliance on
   artificial food or increased aggression due to increased density of
   visiting individuals. We studied sugar-water feeder-associated bird
   behaviour in two cities with different climates. We investigate whether
   season, city, or sugar concentration influenced bird foraging activity
   and aggressiveness. We then test whether feeder presence affected
   backyard bird composition. Birds were most aggressive and used
   sugar-water feeders most actively in winter, especially the omnivorous
   native tauhou (Zosterops lateralis). We also found city and seasonal
   differences in sugar-water feeder usage and aggression. Further, in
   Auckland, the city with the warmer climate, New Zealand's largest
   nectarivorous species, tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae), was more
   likely to be aggressive at feeders with higher sugar concentrations but
   foraged longer at feeders with lower sugar concentrations. Neither
   feeder presence nor sugar concentration influenced garden bird species
   richness or abundance. We discuss the effects of sugar-water feeding on
   bird behaviour at the global and local scale and suggest future study

   percentage of yards with trees and plants with fruits or berries were

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite interest in the contribution of evapotranspiration (ET) of
   residential turfgrass lawns to household and municipal water budgets
   across the United States, the spatial and temporal variability of
   residential lawn ET across large scales is highly uncertain. We measured
   instantaneous ET (ETinst) of lawns in 79 residential yards in six
   metropolitan areas: Baltimore, Boston, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul
   (mesic climates), Los Angeles and Phoenix (arid climates). Each yard had
   one of four landscape types and management practices: traditional
   lawn-dominated yards with high or low fertilizer input, yards with
   water-conserving features, and yards with wildlife-friendly features. We
   measured ETinst in situ during the growing season using portable
   chambers and identified environmental and anthropogenic factors
   controlling ET in residential lawns. For each household, we used ETinst
   to estimate daily ET of the lawn (ETdaily) and multiplied ETdaily by the
   lawn area to estimate the total volume of water lost through ET of the
   lawn (ETvol). ETdaily varied from 0.9 +/- 0.4 mm d(1) in mesic cities to
   2.9 +/- 0.7 mm d(-1) in arid cities. Neither ETinst nor ETdaily was
   significantly influenced by yard landscape types and ETinst patterns
   indicated that lawns may be largely decoupled from regional rain-driven
   climate patterns. ETvol ranged from similar to 0 L d(-1) to over 2,000 L
   d(-1), proportionally increasing with lawn area. Current irrigation and
   lawn management practices did not necessarily result in different ETinst
   or ETdaily among traditional, water-conserving, or wildlife-friendly
   yards, but smaller lawn areas in water-conserving and wildlife-friendly
   yards resulted in lower ETvol.},

Title = {Susceptibility of Spring-Flowering Garden Plants to Herbivory by Mule
   Deer},
Journal = {WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {131-135},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Many people look forward to spring flowers, only to discover that mule
   deer (Odocoileus hemionus) have eaten the sprouting plants and flower
   buds. One potential method to prevent this problem is to grow
   unpalatable flowering plants in gardens where deer herbivory is
   expected, but this requires knowledge about the relative palatability of
   plant species. We examined spring-flowering plants in gardens located in
   Cache County, Utah, USA (2010 through 2017), and recorded the proportion
   of leaves and flower buds browsed by mule deer. Mule deer browsing was
   greatest on tulips (Tulipa spp.), grape hyacinths (Muscari spp.), and
   crocuses (Crocus spp.) and lowest on iris (Iris spp.) and daffodils
   (Narcissus spp.) We hypothesized that the first plants to sprout in the
   spring experienced greater levels of deer herbivory because of the lack
   of alternate plants that deer can browse during that time of year. To
   test this hypothesis, we started plants in greenhouses so that they
   sprouted at the same time. We then placed these plants in locations
   throughout Cache Valley where there were deer trails and deer feces.
   Among these plants, tulip, liatris (Liatris spp.), and grape hyacinth
   were browsed heavily, suggesting that deer found these plants palatable.
   In contrast, crocus were rarely eaten, suggesting that deer damage on
   this plant results more from its early sprouting rather than its
   palatability. Planting unpalatable plants may be a viable approach to
   reducing homeowners' angst from finding that their spring-flowering
   plants have been browsed. Wildlife biologists and Cooperative Extension
   agents should find our results useful when guiding homeowners in
   selecting which spring-flowering plants to grow in areas where deer
   herbivory can be expected. (C) 2018 The Wildlife Society.},

Abstract = {Bird feeding on residential property is a popular activity throughout
   Western countries. Advocates insist the practice is beneficial, while
   opponents maintain that it can result in a wide range of negative
   outcomes including malnutrition. The biological effects of `backyard
   feeding' were studied in Australian magpies Gymnorhina tibicen during
   the non-breeding season in 1999 in the Greater Brisbane and the Lockyer
   Valley regions, south-east Queensland, Australia. Six magpie populations
   were selected and 70 birds were individually tagged for identification.
   The birds were provided with processed foods, 20-40 g per bird daily. To
   monitor the effects of the food, blood chemistry and body mass (BM) were
   used as indices. Significant effects were observed in BM and plasma
   cholesterol (PC), showing strong sensitivity to food provisioning.
   Significant effects on PC and uric acid were found only when birds were
   fed dog sausage. Results suggest that blood PC levels in magpies are
   readily influenced by, probably, the lipids present in food, and that
   the type of food can affect blood PC levels. These effects may occur
   widely among fed magpies if the influence that we demonstrated at plasma
   level can be generalized. Following the free-ranging study, six magpies
   were captured and subjected to a 6-day captive experiment to determine
   whether the selected foods had the potential to alter the birds' blood
   chemistry. It was found that all of the foods, when provided ad libitum,
   influence at least two of the three blood parameters (PC and
   non-esterified fatty acids). Due to its popularity, wildlife feeding
   will continue. To make wildlife-feeding activities truly sustainable,
   there is a need for further studies. This study clearly demonstrated
   that the physiology of wild magpies can be affected by `backyard
   feeding'.},

Title = {Use of rodenticide bait stations by commensal rodents at the
   urban-wildland interface: Insights for management to reduce nontarget
   exposure},
Journal = {PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {77},
Number = {7},
Pages = {3126-3134},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND Pest management professionals use anticoagulant rodenticides,
   usually placed in tamper-resistant bait stations, to control commensal
   rodents, but significant concerns remain about exposure of nontarget
   species, especially at the urban-wildland interface. We deployed digital
   cameras to monitor use of bait stations placed in 90 residential yards
   across Orange County, California, USA. Two bait stations, supplied with
   nontoxic bait, were monitored in each yard for approximately 30
   consecutive days during two camera-trapping sessions between December
   2017 and March 2019. One station was placed on the ground, while the
   other was elevated 1-1.5 m to determine if elevating stations could
   reduce nontarget exposure.
   RESULTS Black rats (Rattus rattus L.) were present at 80\% of sites,
   with mean activity ranging from 0 to 9.6 h each night. There were no
   significant differences between elevated and ground stations in the time
   to discovery, time to bait station entry, or nightly activity of rats.
   Rats discovered bait stations more quickly, and mean nightly activity
   was greater, in yards where rats were detected more frequently. Although
   native rodents visited and entered bait stations occasionally, they were
   relatively rare among our sites (13.3\%), and were detected five times
   less often at elevated stations compared to those on the ground. Yards
   visited by these rodents were significantly nearer to areas of green
   open space and natural vegetation, and tended to have no significant
   barriers to entry, e.g. solid fences or walls.
   CONCLUSIONS By elevating bait stations and avoiding placing rodenticides
   in yards that are likely to be visited by wildlife, pest management
   professionals may be able to reduce the risk of nontarget exposure,
   including secondary poisoning of predators and scavengers, while still
   providing effective control of commensal pests.},

Abstract = {As technology mediates more of human experience, effective conservation
   will increasingly rely on understanding how wildlife inhabits the real

   estimates of bird population densities across the United States.
   Additional social and cultural predictors that we expected to influence
   state-level interest in local bird species explained little geographic
   variation in search activity. Results were congruent across analyses
   that focused on different bird groups and geographic regions within the
   United States. Our findings suggest that Americans are attuned to the
   avifauna that reside in their state and search for information about
   local species on the Internet. To the extent that searches reflect
   public values, abundant and easily accessible search activity data can
   be used to increase the relevance of conservation messaging and the

Abstract = {Activities undertaken by householders in their gardens have huge
   potential to enhance city-wide biodiversity, but programs aimed at
   activating householders require an understanding of the factors
   encouraging or acting as barriers to the uptake of different kinds of
   activities. We provided 42 householders with two species-enhancing
   activities, selected from six possibilities, free-of-charge (to remove
   the barrier of initial cost). We collected socio-demographic data as
   well as information on knowledge of common urban species,
   pro-environmental behaviors and nature connectedness. We monitored
   ongoing engagement at two time points: 1 and 6 months. Characteristics
   of householders opting for different activities varied in terms of their
   degree of environmental engagement, their knowledge about common
   species, and the size of their gardens; e.g., bird feeders and bee
   planters were popular with people who did not know the names of common
   species and were not particularly engaged in pro-environmental
   activities respectively, whereas lizard habitat creation was attractive
   to people who were already engaged in wildlife gardening activities.
   Cost to continue with activities was a significant barrier for some
   people, but most householders were willing to practice relatively
   inexpensive activities in small spaces. Esthetics was an important
   factor to be considered when enhancing invertebrate habitat (e.g., bug
   hotels are more attractive than log piles, and planters for bees contain
   colorful flowers). A commonly cited barrier was lack of information
   about wildlife-friendly activities, despite much being available online.
   Most participants (85\%) talked about their activities with others,
   potentially acting as influencers and shifting social norms.},

Title = {Taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional composition and homogenization

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {202},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urban biotic homogenization is expected to be especially important in
   residential yards, where similar human preferences and management
   practices across environmentally heterogeneous regions might lead to the
   selection of similar plant species, closely related species, and/or
   species with similar sets of traits. We investigated how different yard
   management practices determine yard plant diversity and species
   composition in six cities of the U.S., and tested the extent to which
   yard management results in more homogeneous taxonomical, phylogenetic,
   and functional plant communities than the natural areas they replace or
   than relatively unmanaged areas at the residential-wildland interface
   ({''}interstitial{''} areas). We categorized yards based on fertilizer
   input frequency and landscaping style: high-input lawns, low-input
   lawns, and wildlife-certified yards. We defined homogenization as
   decreased average beta-diversity and decreased variance in
   alpha-diversity in yards when compared to natural and interstitial
   areas. We found that all residential yard types regardless of their
   management were functionally more homogeneous for both alpha- and
   beta-diversity than the natural and interstitial areas. Nevertheless,
   wildlife-certified yards were functionally more similar to natural areas
   than lawn-dominated yard types. All yard types were also more
   homogeneous in phylogenetic alpha-diversity compared to natural and
   interstitial areas, but more heterogenous in taxonomic alpha-diversity.
   Within yards, taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity were
   weakly correlated, highlighting the importance of examining multiple
   dimensions of biodiversity beyond taxonomic metrics. Our findings
   underscore the ecological importance of gardening practices that both
   support biodiversity and create residential plant communities that are
   functionally heterogeneous.},

Abstract = {Urbanisation threatens biodiversity globally, yet some animal
   populations persist within urban landscapes. Conservation of urban
   wildlife has prioritised parks and remnant bushland as critical habitat
   and neglected the role that residential gardens offer for conservation.
   We explored the potential for residential gardens to assist the
   conservation of mammals using an online questionnaire administered to
   residents of two case study cities in Australia to identify how
   widespread mammals in cities can be, which garden features promote
   mammal presence, and if the features varied among species with different
   habitat requirements. From 649 responses we found that three mammal
   species with different habitat requirements occurred in residential
   gardens throughout the city landscape. Garden features promoting mammal
   presence were consistent with broad ecological and habitat requirements
   of each species, but differed among both species and regions. Our study
   demonstrates that residential gardens offer a valuable habitat for
   mammals, and that garden features could be manipulated to promote use of
   gardens by these species. By considering gardens in urban planning and
   management actions aimed at conserving urban wildlife, residential
   gardens offer additional habitat to parks, roadside vegetation and urban
   bushland, and can play a significant role in biodiversity conservation.},

Abstract = {Building and preserving a network of greenways can be an intricate
   activity requiring interdisciplinary collaboration. Greenway segments
   often require local input and participation. In addition, greenways are
   not necessarily generic open spaces, but can be managed structurally to
   fulfill specific spatial and temporal requirements. This paper describes
   local activities in the Fargo (North Dakota)-Moorhead (Minnesota)
   metropolitan area related to preserving and embellishing the greenway
   focused around the Red River Valley of the North. This greenway is part
   of a larger Western Hemisphere greenway, composed of riparian corridors
   operating as wildlife habitat migration flyways and as resident wildlife
   habitat. Local activities include demonstration gardens, comprehensive
   corridor planning, habitat analysis, and revegetation studies. From 1985
   to 1990, four spatial treatment investigations were completed, one
   spatial planning study was prepared, and five demonstration gardens were
   built. The spatial treatment investigations revealed that the wildlife
   occupying the greenway could be divided into four habitat-use
   dimensions, suggesting four important habitat associations for the
   greenway. The study also revealed three distinct vegetation zones for
   re-establishing herbaceous vegetation in non-wooded planting conditions.
   In addition, one experiment indicated that replanting the disturbed
   woodland corridor was not influenced by seedling size and that Fraxinus
   pennsylvanica seedlings were highly successful at surviving in a gap
   opening within the forest corridor, In the last experiment, a seeding
   application rate study indicated that seeding rates three times higher
   than recommended rates resulted in improved vegetation cover of
   non-wooded herbaceous vegetation planting sites. The spatial planning
   study illustrated landscape patterns for the greenway composed of a
   continuous tree canopy corridor, augmented by herbaceous vegetation
   patches, food plots, and snags. To build and manage the greenway, this
   investigation reaffirms the importance of multi-disciplinary
   collaboration, local participation, and the potential individualistic
   structure of a greenway. The study suggests that both broad landscape
   planning visions and detailed site endeavors are necessary to understand
   and manage the greenway successfully.},

Abstract = {Smooth-coated otters (Lutrogale perspicillata) were transient in
   Singapore before one resident family group was observed in 1998,
   presumably having recolonized from Peninsular Malaysia. A population
   survey in 2017 revealed a minimum of 11 groups and 79 individuals. Since
   then, movements of otter groups within urban areas have led to
   increasing numbers of human-otter encounters, including conflicts. We
   determined the current abundance, population structure, and distribution
   of smooth-coated otters in Singapore. We assessed seven sampling zones
   nationwide through verified sighting records and social media. Mortality
   records from 2019 to 2021 were sourced from the Otter Working Group and
   Wildlife Reserves Singapore. In early 2021, there were a minimum of 17
   groups and 170 individuals. Groups ranged from 2 to 24 individuals.
   Smooth-coated otters occupy coastal areas, waterways, reservoirs, and
   sites within the city center in urban gardens and ponds. Following
   territorial conflicts at waterways, smooth-coated otter groups moved
   into the urban matrix. Vehicle collisions are the main cause of
   mortality and are frequent at dams separating freshwater and coastal
   habitats. While there is a clear increase in smooth-coated otter numbers
   since 2017, there remain multiple natural and human-caused threats to
   otter persistence.},

   smaller herbivores and carnivores using residential yards in urban
   areas, but larger ungulates and carnivores were only detected on the
   urban fringe, or in woodlots. Backyard chicken coops were positively
   correlated with raccoon activity but were not positively correlated with
   other predators, suggesting that chicken coops are attracting raccoons,
   but not other predators, to yards. Fenced-in dogs were negatively
   correlated with most mammals suggesting that confined dogs keep mammals
   out of yards. Unfenced dogs and fences without dogs, showed a more
   varied relationship with mammal activity. These results show an
   encouraging sign of how humans can coexist with wildlife, even in urban

   case study from one such tea garden. We observed a diversity of wild
   mammals, both herbivores and carnivores, using open grass patches,
   swamps and vegetation along streams in the tea garden. Large mammals
   were observed to forage in such areas and return to the adjoining
   forests. Small mammals were either resident or used stream vegetation as
   a corridor to move from one side of the forest to the opposite side.
   Dhole (Cuon alpinus) often preyed on sambar (Cervus unicolor) and even
   denned twice in the estate. We also observed a minimal human-animal
   conflict in the area. Problems such as stealing of meat from sambar
   kills made by dhole, could be overcome by awareness. We propose that
   such areas can be effectively managed such that it could facilitate
   movement of wild mammals with least damage to the commercial activity
   related to tea. Such a wildlife management strategy can become a model

Abstract = {Residential gardens are a principal component of urban green
   infrastructure throughout the world and their potential positive
   contributions to biodiversity are increasingly recognised. But the
   characteristics of gardens reflect the needs, values and interests of
   individual households. The present review summarises evidence from
   studies of garden biodiversity published in the scientific literature,
   describes major themes and identifies important knowledge gaps. A search
   of the Web of Science database identified 408 published articles on the
   biodiversity of residential gardens (1981-2022), with numbers increasing
   over time and a strong bias towards Europe (32.1\%) and North America
   (23.8\%). Plants and invertebrates were most frequently studied, and
   species diversity was often correlated with garden size and habitat
   complexity. Botanic composition and vegetation cover were often
   positively associated with the diversity and abundance of fauna.
   Non-native plants contributed substantially to garden plant diversity
   and evidence from some studies indicated benefits to other species
   linked to their functional attributes. Intensive management including
   frequent lawn mowing, fertiliser and pesticide application, and a more
   formal, `neater' garden appearance were often associated with reduced
   biodiversity. However, results varied amongst studies, for example in
   relation to the impacts of mowing frequency on lawn diversity. There was
   a general paucity of experimental evidence on the impacts of different
   management regimes on garden biodiversity and few replicated
   experimental tests of recommended `wildlife-friendly practices'. Several
   studies identified the importance of connectivity amongst gardens and
   with other green infra-structure for species dispersal and ecosystem
   functioning. Emerging threats to garden biodiversity include their
   replacement by development, conversion to hard surfaces and declining
   plot sizes. Managing these challenges and maximising the biodiversity
   value of residential gardens requires greater engagement from
   policymakers and planners, and partnerships between public bodies and
   private households to co-ordinate local initiatives.},

Abstract = {The majority of the world's population now lives in cities, where
   reduced levels of native biodiversity, coupled with fewer opportunities
   for people to experience nature, are expected to result in an urban
   public increasingly disconnected from the natural environment.
   Residential gardens have great potential to both support native species
   and allow people daily contact with nature. Embracing the
   epistemological assumption that urban residents' interactions with
   nature in their gardens and parks may be complex, unpredictable,
   contradictory, and context-dependent, we used an interpretative
   phenomenological analysis approach to explore the human relationship
   with urban nature in a New Zealand city. We conducted 21 semi-structured
   ``go-along{''} interviews to facilitate a deeper understanding of
   participants' personal experiences of nature in parks and gardens.
   Interviews revealed a tension between stated values and concrete actions
   affecting urban biodiversity in private gardens. This value-action gap
   stemmed from the multiple purposes and values that people hold for their
   gardens, which do not necessarily align with conservation of native
   nature. By recognizing that urban residents hold multiple values and
   want their gardens to fulfill multiple purposes, local authorities
   aiming to promote nature conservation in cities can design wildlife
   gardening programs that meet these multiple needs and reconcile
   conflicting priorities.},

Title = {Urban mammals: what does the future hold? An analysis of the factors
   affecting patterns of use of residential gardens in Great Britain},

Abstract = {1Urban areas are predicted to grow significantly in the foreseeable
   future because of increasing human population growth. Predicting the
   impact of urban development and expansion on mammal populations is of
   considerable interest due to possible effects on biodiversity and
   human-wildlife conflict.
   2The British government has recently announced a substantial housing
   programme to meet the demands of its growing population and changing
   socio-economic profile. This is likely to result in the construction of
   high-density, low-cost housing with small residential gardens. To assess
   the potential effects of this programme, we analysed the factors
   affecting the current pattern of use of residential gardens by a range
   of mammal species using a questionnaire distributed in wildlife and
   gardening magazines and via The Mammal Society.
   3Twenty-two species/species groups were recorded. However, the pattern
   of garden use by individual species was limited, with only six
   species/species groups (bats, red fox Vulpes vulpes, grey squirrel
   Sciurus carolinensis, hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus, mice, voles)
   recorded as frequent visitors to > 20\% of gardens in the survey.
   4There was a high degree of association between the variables recorded
   in the study, such that it was difficult to quantify the effects of
   individual variables. However, all species/species groups appeared to be
   negatively affected by the increased fragmentation and reduced proximity
   of natural and semi-natural habitats, decreasing garden size and garden
   structure, but to differing degrees. Patterns of garden use were most
   clearly affected by house location (city, town, village, rural), with
   garden use declining with increasing urbanization for the majority of
   species/species groups, except red foxes and grey squirrels. Increasing
   urbanization is likely to be related to a wide range of interrelated
   factors, any or all of which may affect a range of mammal species.
   5Overall, the probable effects of the planned housing development
   programme in Britain are not likely to be beneficial to mammal
   populations, although the pattern of use examined in this study may
   represent patterns of habitat selection by species rather than
   differences in distribution or abundance. Consequently, additional data
   are required on the factors affecting the density of species within
   urban environments.},

Abstract = {One approach for measuring the potential biodiversity in new urban
   construction projects is through ecological models that predict how
   wildlife will respond. For the United Kingdom, such models have only
   been developed for birds, but to maximise the extent to which models
   represent overall biodiversity, species from different indicator groups
   must be considered.Here, we assess this possibility for butterflies by
   combining citizen science survey data with high-resolution digital maps.
   We derive detailed characteristics of urban landscapes around survey
   sites using previously established methods and quantify their
   relationship to counts of adults of 18 butterfly species in urban and
   peri-urban settings.Higher butterfly counts were found when traversing
   urban sites with larger areas of semi-natural grassland, other managed
   greenspaces and adjacent arable land. Most of the butterfly community
   were found to have negative relationships with highly built-up or
   fragmented landscapes.We found high species-specificity for different
   details of urban form, particularly in habitat elements such as gardens,
   vegetation around railways and grass verges.Policy implications.
   Improving biodiversity is now part of legislation governing new
   construction projects from England and Wales. However, predicting
   quantitative changes from hypothetical land-use modifications remains
   challenging. Our models provide the foundation through which butterfly
   abundance could be integrated into an urban biodiversity assessment
   tool, providing species- and community-level statistics to
   non-specialists from the urban planning and design sector. This would
   allow them to hone configurations for built surfaces, private gardens,
   greenspaces and wildlife areas and assess their capacity to provide
   residents with the intended access to nature.

Abstract = {Large parts of urban space around the world exist of small-scale plots
   such as domestic gardens. These small-scale urban spaces carry potential
   for enhancing biodiversity, sustainability and ecosystem services in and
   beyond cities. However, domestic gardening and residential garden

   create habitat and biological diversity. Yard-management decisions
   impact socio-ecological systems in various ways, for example through
   irrigation patterns, fertilization or the use of pesticides or through
   the choice for exotic species that may become invasive over time.
   Yard-management decisions can also positively influence the presence of
   pollinators, improve soil quality or even foster small scale `Wildlife
   Habitats' that can function as ecological stepping stones to the wider
   environment. In this paper a pilot assessment is presented of the
   contribution of residential front-yards in Phoenix (Arizona) and
   Maastricht (The Netherlands) to biodiversity, ecosystem services and

Title = {Activity and movement of small mammal tick hosts at the urban fringes of
   Sydney, Australia},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {11},
Pages = {927-938},
Abstract = {Context. Small mammals may traverse the urban fringe and use both
   natural and anthropogenic resources. In Australia, human commensal black
   rats (Rattus rattus) and native long-nosed bandicoots (Perameles nasuta)
   are important tick hosts, which can be found persisting at the urban
   fringe, leading to human-wildlife conflict. Aims. We aimed to (1)
   determine the relative activity of small mammals in yards and
   associations with yard attributes, (2) compare activity of black rats
   and long-nosed bandicoots in bushland with activity in yards and (3)
   determine the proportion of black rats and long-nosed bandicoots that
   crossed the urban fringe. We predicted that native bandicoots would be
   more active in bushland habitats and that black rats would be more
   active in yards. Methods. We used camera trapping in 56 residential
   yards, 18 of which were paired with adjacent bushland to measure small
   mammal activity in the two habitats. We recorded yard attributes and
   examined these associations using generalised linear models. We used
   isodar analysis to investigate black rat preferences of bushland habitat
   compared with yards, and we used Rhodamine B baiting to investigate
   movement at the urban fringe. Key results. We found that black rats were
   the most active small mammal in residential yards and were detected in
   more yards than other small mammals, followed by bandicoots. Black rat
   activity was greater in yards adjacent to bushland, but no other yard
   attributes were associated with black rat and bandicoot activity.
   Overall, activity tended to be higher in bushland than in yards at
   paired locations. Conclusions. Our findings suggest residential yards
   likely provide high-quality resources for long-nosed bandicoots. Low
   rates of movement at the urban fringe (6\%), and a preference for
   bushland at low densities suggests that black rats may be synanthropic
   rather than commensal, occupying an urban niche but not depending on
   anthropogenic resources as expected. Implications. Residential
   properties located adjacent to bushland may be exposed to increased
   black rat activity in yards. Future work should consider how introduced
   rats may be controlled in bushland to assist urban rat control efforts
   and avoid non-target impacts. Residential yards are likely to be
   important habitat for the persistence of long-nosed bandicoots in urban
   environments.},

Title = {Human-elephant conflict in Xishuangbanna Prefecture, China:
   Distribution, diffusion, and mitigation},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The conflict between humans and wild animals is a special type of
   phenomena between human development and wild animal conservation, not
   only leading to massive economic loss to local residents, but also
   imposing severe impacts upon the production and living activities and
   even personal safety of the residents. Human-elephant conflict has
   existed as a phenomenon of human settlement development for more than 20
   years in Xishuangbanna, China. There are periodic incidents of wild
   elephants hurting/killing people as well as feeding on and destroying
   subsistence and cash crops. It is an increasingly urgent and important
   issue for China to resolve while protecting and managing Asian
   elephants. Our study employed an Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis model
   to perform a risk assessment of areas where the Asian elephant currently
   is distributed and to predict future risks. It employed a Circuit Theory
   model based on random walk theory to predict multiple potential movement
   or migration pathways of Asian elephants within Xishuangbanna. The
   results indicated that: (1) the regions with human-elephant conflict
   risk in Xishuangbanna Prefecture had an area of about 4349.08 km(2),
   accounting for 22.77\% of the total prefecture area, with the risk
   regions primarily present in the middle and north parts of Menghai
   County and Jinghong City and in Mengla County in which there was a wide
   geographical distribution covering from the south to the north; (2) The
   regions of agriculture and garden that were close to Asian elephant
   distribution and roads were likely occurring risk; (3) There were more
   potential movement paths of elephants within Mengyang and Menghai
   distribution regions, which indicated that the connection of these areas
   was better. While the potential movement paths of elephants within
   Mengla and Shangyong were little; (4) There were some potential movement
   paths between different distribution areas of Asian elephant, but the
   migration possibility of elephants in different distribution areas was
   decreasing due to natural barriers (Mengyang-Menghai has Lancang river)
   and discontinuous potential paths between Mengla and Shangyong.
   Additionally, we discussed that created ecological corridors between
   different natural reserves to allow more dispersal and gene flow of
   elephants and diminish conflict between human and elephant. We also put
   forward compensation suggestions in different risk area. We hope our
   analytical methods can be applied, improved and expanded to other areas
   with similar wildlife damage. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Predicted rapid increases in urbanization in the face of accelerating
   biodiversity loss underscores the need for urban development that

   for increasing urban biodiversity is through the development of ``green

   and the overall value of urban green infrastructure, few studies have
   investigated the habitat value for wildlife of different types of urban
   greenspace. Here, we use a well-established metric in ecology, giving
   up-densities (GUDs), to compare foraging costs for a common urban
   wildlife species, the eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis),
   among three green infrastructure categories: municipal parks, college
   campuses, and residential yards. We found that GUDs for gray squirrels
   did not differ significantly among location categories after controlling
   for proximity to roads, but proximity to roads was associated with
   significantly higher GUDs in all locations. In an explicit test, we also
   found that both proximity to roads and traffic volume were associated
   with higher GUDs. We also found that maximum distance from roads was
   significantly higher for campuses and parks than for residential yards,
   indicating a greater proportion of the area of campuses and parks is
   ``away from roads{''} compared to residential yards. Our results
   indicate that vehicle traffic may contribute significantly to an ``urban
   landscape of fear{''} for gray squirrels and suggest that campus and
   park configurations that reduce road effects could improve habitat
   quality for squirrels and possibly other animals.},

Abstract = {Cemeteries are globally culturally protected greenspaces in cities that
   meet different societal needs and often harbor high biodiversity. To
   harness the potential of cemeteries as urban green infrastructure,
   stakeholders need to understand why people visit cemeteries and their
   preferences. We conducted an online survey in Berlin, Germany (n = 627)
   to understand (i) the reasons for cemetery visits; (ii) preferences for
   cemetery features; (iii) the effect of a dead tree as a wilderness
   component on preferences for differently managed green areas (wild,
   meadows, lawns); (iv) preferences of nature elements as comforting
   experiences; and (v) how reasons for the visit and sociodemographic
   variables relate to respondents' preferences. The major reasons to visit
   cemeteries were `enjoying nature', `mourning', and `historical interest'
   and most preferred cemetery features were `wildlife', `solitude', and
   `vegetation'. Presenting a dead tree did not modulate preference ratings
   for green areas that were depicted on photographs. Comforting
   experiences with nature elements were high overall. The reasons to visit
   had besides socio-demographic variables predictive potential on
   pronounced preferences. The results underscore the importance of
   cemeteries as multidimensional places and indicate tolerance for the
   inclusion of dead trees as important wildlife habitat. Strategies to
   develop cemeteries as shared habitats for people and nature should also
   consider, besides socio-demographic background, the reasons for cemetery
   visits.},

Title = {Managing yards for mammals: Mammal species richness peaks in the suburbs},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {220},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Increased urbanization drives habitat loss, yet residential land-use
   represents significant habitat potential for mammals and could provide
   connectivity between patches of green spaces. Diverse mammal communities
   exist across urban gradients, but it is unclear how mammal community
   composition varies within residential lands. We conducted a camera
   trapping study in 36 residential yards across an urban gradient to
   assess the relative contributions of the degree of urbanization in the
   land-use context versus parcel habitat features, such as vegetation
   structure, on mammal community diversity and composition. We
   hypothesized that land-use context would more strongly influence mammal
   community metrics than parcel features, and that there would be
   species-specific differences in response. We detected 14
   non-domesticated mammal species and found that species richness peaked
   in the suburbs and tapered off at the rural and urban ends of the
   gradient in accordance with patterns seen in other taxonomic groups, yet
   rarely quantified in mammals. Large-bodied interior forest species were
   associated with rural sites, urban-dwelling species were associated with
   urban sites, and suburban sites had an overlap of species types.
   Although composition of mammal species in residential yards appears to
   be strongly related to land-use context, which is often outside of
   residents' control, management of parcel habitat features such as
   retention of large mature trees may facilitate connectivity between
   patches of habitat across urbanizing landscapes. Informed residential
   yard management remains an important tool for urban wildlife management

Title = {The ecological role of native-plant landscaping in residential yards to
   birds during the nonbreeding period},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Residential yards are a form of urban land use that cover a considerable
   amount of area in cities worldwide and provide important habitat for
   wildlife, especially when landscaped with native plants. Nevertheless,
   most native-plant landscaping and wildlife research in the northern
   temperate regions of the world has been conducted during the spring and
   summer breeding period, leaving a gap in our understanding of the
   importance of residential yards and native plants as habitats for
   animals during the nonbreeding period. To fill this gap, we quantified
   the ecological role of native-landscaped yards to avifauna throughout
   Greater Los Angeles (LA), California, during the winter nonbreeding
   period, which is a time of year when the region hosts a high abundance
   and diversity of migratory and resident birds. We surveyed birds and
   habitat features from October to March of 2020 and 2021 at 22 pairs of
   native- and non-native-landscaped yards plus 10 additional
   native-landscaped yards. We had three objectives for our study. First,
   we compared avifaunal communities, including feeding and nonfeeding
   behaviors, and habitat features between native and non-native-landscaped
   yards. Second, we quantified relationships between habitat features and
   bird richness, abundance, and feeding and nonfeeding behaviors-focusing
   on species affiliated with urban or natural terrestrial ecosystems of
   the region. Third, we documented feeding and nonfeeding behaviors by
   birds with native and non-native plants. Native-landscaped yards had a
   greater cover of native trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, and a
   higher cover of natural habitat elements, including leaf litter and
   bare-ground cover. Bird richness and abundance-especially bird species
   affiliated with tree- and shrub-dominated cosystems-were greater in
   native than non-native-landscaped yards. Further, yards with a higher
   cover of native plants supported greater numbers of feeding birds, with
   individuals focusing their foraging behaviors on distinct native trees
   and shrubs, including Quercus spp. (oak), Heteromeles spp. (toyon),
   Arctostaphylos spp. (manzanita), and Salvia spp. (sage). Our results
   suggest that residential yards landscaped with native plants provide
   important habitat for birds during the nonbreeding period and are a
   viable approach for residents and cities if improving conditions for
   birds throughout the annual cycle is a goal.},

Title = {Ultrasonic deterrents reduce nuisance cat (<i>Felis catus</i>) activity
   on suburban properties},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Urban environments are increasingly important for biodiversity
   conservation, but pet cats threaten wildlife therein, displaying
   nuisance behaviour such as hunting, fighting, fouling and urine
   spraying. In an attempt to empower landholders wishing to reduce cat
   incursions humanely, we tested the effectiveness of two ultrasonic cat
   deterrents (CatStop (c) and On-Guard Mega-Sonic Cat Repeller (c)).
   After confirming in arena trials that cats detect and respond negatively
   to an ultrasonic device, we tested both deterrents in 18 suburban
   gardens in Perth, Western Australia. Camera monitoring at foci of cat
   activity (e.g. fish ponds, property entry/exit points) occurred for two
   weeks before (Period 1: device off), during (Period 2: device on) and
   after (Period 3: device off) the activation of deterrents. Data included
   individual cat demographics and behaviours, number of cat detections per
   site per day per sampling period, the duration of cat activity, and
   detection of non-target species.
   Seventy-eight unique cats were detected at 17 of 18 garden sites (2-9
   cats/garden). Over half the cats could be sexed (56.4\%, with 65.1\%
   males). Nearly 53.0\% of cats were confirmed to be pets living nearby.
   Cats that were most active in period 1 (>= 100 s total activity
   duration) were classified as `residents'; all others were `peripherals'.
   Overall, the ultrasonic deterrents reduced the frequency of incursions
   into gardens by resident cats by 46\%, while the duration of incursions
   was reduced by 78\%. Cat activity declined significantly from period 1
   (baseline) to period 2 for resident cats but not peripheral cats (50\%
   reduction; p = 0.001), and remained depressed in period 3 for resident
   cats but not peripheral cats (p < 0.001). Peripheral cat activity
   remained at an unchanging low level across all three periods. Males were
   slightly more active than females over the experiment (p = 0.04), but
   sexes did not vary in response to deterrents (p > 0.05). Cats confirmed
   as owned (53\% of cats) generated more activity than cats of unknown
   ownership status (p = 0.03), probably reflecting proximity of their
   residences to trial gardens. Both deterrent models had similar effects
   (p = 0.89).
   By allowing pets to roam, cat owners are complicit in cat nuisance. This
   requires public education. Ultrasonic deterrents offer a cost-effective,
   humane option to reduce incursions by unwanted cats. Ultrasonic
   deterrents will not prevent all incursions, but they reduce their
   frequency and duration. Reduced cat activity has flow-on benefits to
   wildlife across a variety of urban-suburban settings, including gardens
   and parks. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Factors influencing butterfly and bumblebee richness and abundance in
   gardens},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {908},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Gardens are often depicted as green sanctuaries, providing refuges for
   wildlife displaced from the countryside due to intensive farming. While
   gardens have been recognized for their positive impact on biodiversity
   conservation, few studies have investigated the impact of pesticide
   usage in domestic gardens. In this study, we explored how butterfly and
   bumblebee populations in gardens across the UK are influenced by habitat
   quality, urbanisation level and pesticide use. To achieve this, we
   engaged with participants in Garden BirdWatch, a weekly garden wildlife
   recording scheme operated by the British Trust for Ornithology.
   Participants in the study provided data on the attributes of their
   garden and surrounding area and were asked to complete a questionnaire
   about their pesticide practices. Of the 417 gardens from which we
   obtained useful data, we found that 32.6 \% had pesticides applied to.
   Urbanisation and garden quality were the main factors influencing insect
   populations. Butterfly richness was lower in suburban and urban gardens
   and butterfly abundance lower only in suburban gardens when compared to
   rural gardens, but this relationship did not hold for bumblebees.
   Abundance of butterflies and bumblebees, but not their species richness,
   increased with the habitat quality of gardens. Butterflies were lower in
   abundance and richness in more northerly gardens, which was not the case
   for bumblebees. Effects of pesticides were relatively weak, but
   butterfly richness was 7 \% lower in gardens applying any pesticide.
   Overall, our study shows that garden butterfly and bumblebee abundance
   and richness are strongly influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic
   factors, and that garden management can have an important positive
   effect on insect population.},

Abstract = {Private domestic gardens contribute substantially to the biodiversity of
   urban areas and benefit human health and well-being. We previously
   reported a study of 267 gardens across five cities in the United Kingdom
   in which variation in geographical and climatic factors had little
   bearing on the richness, diversity and composition of plant species. We
   therefore hypothesise that garden management is an important factor in
   determining garden characteristics. Here, from the same sample of
   gardens, we investigate potential associations between the uses to which
   people put their gardens, the types of management activities they
   undertake, and the characteristics of those gardens. Householders (n =
   265) completed a questionnaire detailing various aspects of garden use
   and management activities. The majority of respondents used their
   gardens chiefly for relaxation, recreation, and eating. Fewer than one
   fifth included ``gardening{''} amongst their garden uses even though all
   performed some garden management, suggesting that not all management
   activity resulted from an interest in gardening. Garden-watering and
   lawn-mowing were the most prevalent activities and were predictors of
   other types of management including weeding, vegetation-cutting,
   leaf-collection, and dead-heading flowers. A number of these activities
   were associated with one another, the richness and composition of plant
   species, and the number of land uses in gardens. However, relationships
   between management activities and the amount of tall vegetation were
   less consistent, and garden management appeared to be independent of
   garden area. More species of amphibians, birds, and mammals were
   observed in gardens with ponds and in which efforts were made to attract
   wildlife, particularly by providing drinking water. This study supports
   the hypothesis that garden use and management is associated with garden
   characteristics.},

Title = {A local ecological knowledge-based assessment of anthropodependence for
   large mammals in anthropogenic landscapes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {290},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Humans have shaped the environment through landscape transformation,
   disturbance, and resource exploitation, leading to major habitat
   modification and fragmentation. Mammal species are massively threatened
   by these changes and their diversity implies various responses to human
   disturbance. It is essential to understand the conditions for their
   persistence in human-dominated landscapes, and the drivers of
   humans-mammals' coexis- tence to apply relevant conservation measures.
   The Garden Route Biosphere Reserve, in South Africa, a mosaic landscapes
   where human activities and wildlife meet, is an ideal site to examine
   how anthropogenic attributes influence wildlife occurrence. To maximise
   our area coverage through a replicable, low-cost protocol, we designed
   an online survey aimed at residents to investigate the effect of
   landscape metrics and property attributes - the availability and type of
   anthropogenic resources, the integrity and type of natural habitats,
   structural disturbances and interferences - on the persistence of
   mammals in such environments. We collected data from 247 respondents and
   modelled the drivers of occurrence for 14 mammal species (>500 g). We
   found speciesspecific responses to synthetic variables describing
   anthropogenic features in the studied landscape and used the
   anthropodependence framework to categorise species profiles. We showed
   that human disturbance combined with the availability of anthropogenic
   resources and natural habitats defined various categories of species
   profiles, which should require differential conservation actions. Local
   ecological knowledge proved promising to understand conditions for
   mammal persistence in human-dominated landscapes. This method also
   allowed researchers to engage with a wide variety of stakeholders, thus
   creating a hub for knowledge exchange.},

Title = {Tracking Canada geese near airports: using spatial data to better inform

Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},

Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {The adaptation of birds to urban environments has created direct hazards
   to air transportation with the potential for catastrophic incidents.
   Bird-aircraft collisions involving Canada geese (Branta canadensis;
   goose) pose greater risks to aircraft than many bird species due to
   their size and flocking behavior. However, information on factors
   driving movements of geese near airports and within aircraft
   arrival/departure areas for application to management are limited. To
   address this need, we deployed 31 neck collar-mounted global positioning
   system transmitters on Canada geese near Midway International Airport in
   Chicago, Illinois, USA during November 2015 to February 2016. We used
   the movement data obtained to model environmental and behavioral factors
   influencing the intersection of goose movements (i.e., transition from 1
   location to another) with air operations areas (i.e., aircraft flight
   paths). Of 3,008 goose movements recorded, 821 intersected a 3-km buffer
   around the airport representing U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
   recommended distances from wildlife attractants, and 399 intersected
   flight paths for approaching and landing aircraft. The effects of
   weather (i.e., snow cover, temperature, wind speed) on the probability
   of geese flying varied with different air operation areas while certain
   habitat resources greatly increased the probability of intersection. For
   example, the juxtaposition of foraging (railyards with spilled grain)
   and loafing areas (rooftops) near the airport led to a higher
   probability of movements intersecting important air operations areas.
   The average altitude of flying geese was 29.8 m above the ground,
   resulting in the greatest risk of collision being within 0.5 km of the
   end of runways. We suggest airport goose collision mitigation management
   actions, such as reducing habitat resources near the airport and using
   focused nonlethal harassment or physical modifications, when guided by
   animal movement data, may further mitigate bird-strike risks.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is one of the biggest global threats to biodiversity.
   However, urban areas can offer opportunities for biodiversity
   conservation because of the assortment of resources and numerous taxa
   that occur in these habitats. While the use of gardens by animals is
   well documented, the ability of native fauna to exclusively use (i.e.
   reside in) them is largely uninvestigated and therefore constrains our
   current understanding of their conservation `value'. We aimed to
   determine whether individuals of a threatened species can exclusively
   reside in gardens for several months of their life, and the frequency
   that novel resources (i.e. non-natural) are used compared to natural
   ones. We predicted that individuals captured in gardens would use both
   bushland and residential habitat, and use natural resources more
   frequently than novel resources because of the assumption that remnant
   habitat is more suitable than modified gardens. Using the Critically
   Endangered western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis) as a
   case study, we captured 20 individuals in gardens and radio-tracked them
   for a period of 95 +/- 3.3 days to determine their habitat use. Contrary
   to our predictions, for the duration of our study individuals
   exclusively resided within gardens, irrespective of proximity to
   bushland, and used novel resources more frequently than natural
   resources for all behaviours. We also found that over half (53\%) of all
   the captured female possums had pouch young, and at the conclusion of
   the study, male possums were on average 43 g heavier. Our results
   exemplify that gardens can be of sufficient quality to support
   individuals, and that these modified habitats should be incorporated
   into conservation policy in urban landscapes. Given the extensive number
   of threatened species located within cities globally, our finding that a
   threatened species can reside exclusively within gardens further
   highlights the conservation opportunity that residential landscapes and
   cities offer wildlife.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {285},
Number = {4},
Pages = {256-265},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Conservation biology and landscape ecology are increasingly concerned
   with the effects of urbanization on wildlife, including the influences
   of habitat edges. This is particularly important in landscapes where a
   restriction on species home-range movements may reduce an animal's
   ability to access habitat resources, which ultimately reduces population
   viability. Despite this, there is limited information available on the
   movement behavior of wildlife at forest edges adjoining urban areas. We
   addressed this by radiotracking 30 squirrel gliders Petaurus
   norfolcensis in forest interiors and near road and residential edges in
   the fragmented urban landscape of south-east Queensland, Australia. An
   assessment of fixed-kernel (FK100\% and FK50\%) and minimum convex
   polygon (MCP100\%) methods revealed that FK provided the most reliable
   home-range estimates. We applied a general linear model to test the
   influence of season, age and sex relative to habitat type (forest
   interiors, road edge, residential edge) on squirrel glider home-range
   size (FK95\% \& FK50\%). We found that squirrel gliders living in
   interior habitats had significantly larger home ranges (7.07 ha +/-
   0.43) than individuals living near roads (3.79 ha +/- 0.22) and
   residential areas (3.40 ha +/- 0.26). Similarly, home-range core areas
   (FK50\%) were significantly larger in forest interiors (1.49 +/- 0.13
   ha) than near road (0.78 +/- 0.07 ha) and residential edges (0.70 +/-
   0.08 ha). We also found that squirrel gliders regularly cross narrow
   roads up to 20m wide and with a tree gap up to 15m to access adjacent
   vegetation, and are willing to utilize foraging resources in residential
   backyards. Changes in squirrel glider home ranges near edges identified
   in this study have implications for understanding how this species
   responds to urban edges, and we highlight important areas for future
   edge-related studies to correctly inform conservation and management.},

Title = {Species traits explain public perceptions of human-bird interactions},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The impacts of urbanization on bird biodiversity depend on
   human-environment interactions that drive land management. Although a
   commonly studied group, less attention has been given to public
   perceptions of birds close to home, which can capture people's direct,
   everyday experiences with urban biodiversity. Here, we used ecological
   and social survey data collected in the metropolitan region of Phoenix,
   Arizona, USA, to determine how species traits are related to people's
   perceptions of local bird communities. We used a trait-based approach to
   classify birds by attributes that may influence human-bird interactions,
   including color, size, foraging strata, diet, song, and cultural niche
   space based on popularity and geographic specificity. Our classification
   scheme using hierarchical clustering identified four trait categories,
   labeled as Metropolitan (gray, loud, seedeaters foraging low to ground),
   Familiar (yellow/brown generalist species commonly present in suburban
   areas), Distinctive (species with distinguishing appearance and song),
   and Hummingbird (hummingbird species, small and colorful). Strongly held
   beliefs about positive or negative traits were also more consistent than
   ambivalent ones. The belief that birds were colorful and unique to the
   regional desert environment was particularly important in fortifying
   perceptions. People largely perceived hummingbird species and birds with
   distinctive traits positively. Similarly, urban-dwelling birds from the
   metropolitan trait group were related to negative perceptions, probably
   due to human-wildlife conflict. Differences arose across
   sociodemographics (including income, age, education, and Hispanic/Latinx
   identity), but explained a relatively low amount of variation in
   perceptions compared with the bird traits present in the neighborhood.
   Our results highlight how distinctive aesthetics, especially color and
   song, as well as traits related to foraging and diet drive perceptions.
   Increasing people's direct experiences with iconic species tied to the
   region and species with distinguishing attributes has the potential to
   improve public perceptions and strengthen support for broader
   conservation initiatives in and beyond urban ecosystems.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {151-165},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Human-wildlife interactions are believed to be increasing worldwide, and
   a number of studies have analyzed the risks posed by larger carnivores.
   However, people can also perceive smaller species of carnivores as
   threatening, particularly in urban areas. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes)
   started to colonize British cities in the 1930s, and there is growing
   public concern about foxes biting people, particularly babies. These
   events are generally described in the press as attacks and generate
   intense media coverage and speculation that foxes view human infants as
   potential prey. Because foxes rely primarily on auditory cues for
   hunting, we conducted acoustic playback experiments in the gardens of 15
   residential houses in northwest Bristol, United Kingdom, in December
   2015 and 11 gardens from May to June 2016 to determine whether urban
   foxes were attracted to infant distress calls (cries). Foxes were not
   more likely to be attracted to infant cries or laughs than silence,
   although a minority of foxes cautiously approached and contacted the
   source of both types of infant vocalization. Their behavior appeared to
   be investigative rather than aggressive or predatory. Our review of the
   incidents reported in the British media showed that most people were
   bitten or scratched while sleeping, and adults were more likely to be
   bitten than children. The nature of the interactions and the wounds
   inflicted suggest that the foxes were using their mouth or forefeet to
   investigate an unusual object. Most incidents occurred inside people's
   homes, even though it is unusual for foxes to enter houses. The data
   suggested that incidents where people were bitten were chance events,
   possibly involving a particularly bold fox. To minimize the risk to the
   public, more quantitative data are required on the age, social status,
   and health of the foxes that enter houses and those that bite people.},

Abstract = {Although urban domestic gardens hold great significance for biodiversity
   support in cities, these habitats have been relatively insufficiently
   studied, especially in developing country contexts. This paper assesses
   the composition, diversity, density and distribution of plant vegetation
   in urban domestic gardens in the rapidly expanding south Indian city of
   Bangalore. Overall species diversity is high, with 1,668 trees from 91
   species, as well as 192 species of herbs and shrubs encountered from a
   total sample of 328 urban single domestic gardens and shared apartment
   gardens distributed across the city. The majority of species were
   uncommon, found in less than 5 \% of all sampled locations. A high
   proportion of about 30 \% of all species had uses as food or as spices,
   medicinal properties, and/or religious significance. In general, large
   shared apartment gardens and single domestic gardens had a greater
   number of trees with larger size, and greater tree and herb/shrub
   diversity compared to small shared apartment gardens and small to
   moderate sized single domestic gardens. Shared apartment gardens tended
   to harbor relatively distinct sets of species, especially trees, palms
   and plants with largely ornamental significance, while single domestic
   gardens contained a greater proportion of flowering and medicinal plants
   used in daily worship, as well as fruit bearing and spice bearing plants
   and trees. Residents observed a wide range of other animal and insect
   species in their gardens, but also indicated a decrease in wildlife
   biodiversity over time. The majority of residents observed some cultural
   practices associated with feeding of urban wildlife and insects
   including the provision of rice and water for birds, and of sugar for
   ants. The results of this research provide a comprehensive description
   of plant diversity and distribution in single domestic gardens and
   shared apartment gardens of different sizes, which can be very important
   for citizen groups, planners and administrators working towards urban
   planting and greening in the south Indian city of Bangalore. They also
   supplement the extremely limited information currently available on
   urban domestic gardens outside of cities in the west.},

Abstract = {A preliminary analysis of the use by bats of National Trust properties
   revealed that all 14 resident species have been recorded. Comparison
   with a national database of records for Britain managed by English
   Nature (NCC Bat database) showed that the scarcer species are better
   represented roosting in buildings on Trust properties than in other
   buildings. In addition, survey of Trust properties has shown that a high
   proportion of buildings are used by bats. Bats provide unusual wildlife
   links between buildings, gardens and countryside through which the Trust
   can promote nature conservation, and resolve conflicts between building
   or landscape restoration and the bat habitat requirements. The role of
   the County Bat Groups in survey and promotion of bats on Trust
   properties is becoming increasingly important, especially if we are able
   to identify key properties for bats. (C) 1995 The Linnean Society of

Abstract = {As suburban landscapes expand, it is critical to understand their
   capacity to support wildlife. Pollinators, specifically bees
   (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila), are to some degree compatible with
   urbanization and may be able to exist in suburbs in diverse assemblages.
   We surveyed 21 residential gardens for bees in Westchester County, a
   suburban area immediately north of New York City. From a sample of 1,675
   individuals, we documented 110 species, of which 95\% were native, 50\%
   were solitary, and 93\% were polylectic. In terms of abundance of
   specimens, eusocial (50\% of specimens), native (97\%), and polylectic
   (98\%) bees were dominant. Contrary to our expectation, based on
   previous bee surveys in urban landscapes, the bee community documented
   was not depauperate in either soil-nesting or parasitic species (65 and
   19\% of species, respectively), nor was it enriched in exotic species
   (6\% of species). Instead, the assemblage resembled the richer bee fauna
   documented at a 1,520-ha research preserve (forest) located in the same
   region, although certain specialist (oligolectic) and/or
   forest-associated species were absent. These results suggest that
   suburban landscapes in eastern North America have the potential to host
   relatively diverse and intact bee communities.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Wildlife living in the suburbs faces the challenge of dealing with human
   presence and yard management (including the occurrence of pets) which
   vary at the scale of the house block. This study examined the influence
   of ecological factors (e.g. extent of grass and food availability) and
   anthropogenic factors (e.g. human activity and garden usage) on breeding
   site choice and reproductive success of the ground-nesting masked
   lapwing Vanellus miles on Phillip Island, Australia. Lapwings nested
   less frequently in residential properties (high levels of human usage)
   compared with vacant blocks and holiday houses. They were also more
   likely to breed on properties with high food availability and larger
   areas of grass. None of these variables influenced clutch size or the
   probability of eggs hatching, although larger clutches and higher
   hatching rates tended to be associated with more food. This study shows
   that, for an urban exploiting species, habitat quality is not homogenous
   at the scale of the house block, and that human activity is avoided by a
   species generally considered highly tolerant of people. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Sustainable landscaping programs are voluntary initiatives that

   urban ecosystems by providing landscaping materials, guidelines, and
   educational resources. Our goal was to examine the recommendations and
   outcomes of these programs in the United States and their value for
   encouraging conservation practices in residential ecosystems. We
   conducted a comprehensive web search and identified 193 sustainable
   landscaping programs in the United States. Programs aim to increase
   native species richness, affordably manage stormwater runoff, and offer
   residents meaningful experiences with nature. Sustainable landscaping
   programs present many opportunities to engage people with local
   ecological knowledge and conservation practices, provide accessible
   spaces for environmental education, cultivate interdisciplinary research
   collaborations, and advance inclusion in conservation. However,
   assessments of their ecological value are rare, leaving many questions
   surrounding the benefits to biodiversity and water quality afforded by
   participation. Many programs also require investments in landscaping
   materials and certification fees that might limit participation by some
   households. Future work should examine how recommended practices
   influence urban biodiversity, identify and address barriers to
   participation, and generate social-ecological knowledge that can inform
   future programs.},

Title = {Horticultural availability and homeowner preferences drive plant
   diversity and composition in urban yards},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Understanding the factors that influence biodiversity in urban areas is
   important for informing management efforts aimed at enhancing the
   ecosystem services in urban settings and curbing the spread of invasive
   introduced species. We determined the ecological and socioeconomic
   factors that influence patterns of plant richness, phylogenetic
   diversity, and composition in 133 private household yards in the
   Minneapolis-Saint Paul Metropolitan area, Minnesota, USA. We compared
   the composition of spontaneously occurring plant species and those
   planted by homeowners with composition in natural areas (at the Cedar
   Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve) and in the horticulture pool of species
   available from commercial growers. Yard area and fertilizer frequency
   influenced species richness of the spontaneous species but expressed
   homeowner values did not. In contrast, the criteria that homeowners
   articulated as important in their management decisions, including
   aesthetics, wildlife, neatness and food provision, significantly
   predicted cultivated species richness. Strikingly, the composition of
   plant species that people cultivated in their yards resembled the
   taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of species available
   commercially. In contrast, the taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of
   spontaneous species showed high similarity to natural areas. The large
   fraction of introduced species that homeowners planted was a likely
   consequence of what was available for them to purchase. The study links
   the composition and diversity of yard flora to their natural and
   anthropogenic sources and sheds light on the human factors and values
   that influence the plant diversity in residential areas of a major urban
   system. Enhanced understanding of the influences of the sources of
   plants, both native and introduced, that enter urban systems and the
   human factors and values that influence their diversity is critical to
   identifying the levers to manage urban biodiversity and ecosystem
   services.},

Abstract = {As global populations grow, cities are stretching their urban boundaries
   into rural areas and bringing the challenges of biodiversity
   conservation into the backyards of homeowners. Planning controls can
   attempt to regulate residents' behaviours to support conservation
   actions for threatened species but need to consider whether community
   attitudes align with conservation objectives. This study investigated
   community attitudes towards planned management interventions in a new
   conservation strategy designed to protect endangered Southern Brown
   Bandicoots in new residential estates around Cranbourne, Australia. A
   survey (n=318, response rate 15.2 per cent) investigated current
   resident attitudes towards bandicoot conservation, cat ownership and
   effectiveness of current planning controls. Results indicate community
   support for a range of bandicoot conservation actions including
   confinement of domestic cats and non-lethal cat controls and for new
   developments being cat-free with bandicoot habitat corridors. Awareness
   of bandicoots correlated with higher support for conservation actions
   while cat owners were less supportive overall, particularly to
   limitations on cat ownership. Potential barriers to management
   interventions include inadequate knowledge, perceived associated risks
   and housing turnover. This information is valuable for conservation
   planning for new developments and to improve implementation of planning
   controls in existing residential areas for delivery of long-term
   protection for threatened species like Southern Brown Bandicoots.},

   placed in separate categories distinguished by green space context
   (parks vs gardens), while very simple and very complex landscapes were
   placed in different categories irrespective of green space context.
   Surprisingly, dense vegetation was highly preferred by respondents. As
   areas of dense vegetation also provide complex habitats for wildlife,
   this highlights the possibility of developing policies and designing

Abstract = {I walk fantastically with the cows along the stock route of the former

   as a closed story of the past `as it was', which projects a set of
   sanitised meanings that allow for neither subtext nor counter readings.
   I problematise the concrete machine of heritage protection utilising
   Deleuze and Guattari's ideas of faciality, where reassuring mosaic faces
   of cows going to the saleyards belong, but anguished faces of cows at
   the slaughterhouse do not. I call upon the cow's face as potential probe
   head to forge connections between past-present-future in hot heritage
   practices which challenge people to question their values and actions.
   Rediscovery of the cow beneath the face at Newmarket saleyards and
   abattoirs could intervene in people's habitual patterns of thinking and
   acting, triggering renegotiation of cultural meanings of ethics,
   welfare, and rights, regarding not only nonhuman animals, but also
   Othered humans, such as those penned in detention centres. Through
   experiential experiment rather than controlled interpretation, hot

   occupancy in an American midwestern city},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {229},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With future human population growth concentrating in urban areas, cities
   are working to counterbalance ecological disturbances resulting from
   development by incorporating green space that supports greater
   biodiversity. An initial line of inquiry into designing
   wildlife-inclusive green space involves evaluating landscapes that are
   associated with the habitat use of urban species. In this study, we
   utilized occupancy modeling to estimate select terrestrial mammal
   presence in a fast-growing mid-sized midwestern city to determine
   possible taxa-specific associations with multiple land use and cover
   variables, specifically those associated with higher degrees of human
   activity. Using motion-triggered infrared trail cameras over eight
   seasons from winter 2017 to fall 2018, we applied a single-species,
   single -season stacked design to estimate occupancy for eight urban
   dwelling mammals. Taxa-specific models contained one of three possible
   detection variables (null, percent green space, or percent impervious
   surface) and combinations of three species-specific variables, natural
   and anthropogenic. We hypothesized that large species, coyote (Canis
   latrans) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), would exhibit
   the most positive association to natural land cover and the most
   negative association to anthropogenic land cover. We also hypothesized
   that small and medium sized species, eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus
   floridanus), gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), opossum (Didelphis
   virginiana), raccoon (Procyon lotor), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and
   striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), would demonstrate a neutral
   association to land cover type, anthropogenic or natural. Our results
   indicated that the presence of anthropogenic features rather than any
   particular natural land cover may be driving wildlife distribution in
   our study area, as none of our species demonstrated a positive
   association to natural land cover (percent recreation, residential
   yards, vacant land, or woodland). Species with a wide range of body
   sizes, showed a negative association with residential yards, indicating
   that this type of green space may be an unnecessary or unsuitable
   subsidizing resource in our study area. With our results in mind, we
   recommend increasing the amount of natural or less manicured green space
   to offset the intensity of impervious surface as well as encouraging the
   establishment of native vegetation in existing and newly con-structed
   residential development to better connect urban green space and
   residential yards to larger adjoining tracts of natural landscapes. For
   our study area and other cities in similar phases of development, these
   suggestions may be essential first steps to reduce biodiversity loss and
   strengthen community ecology as urban areas continue to grow.},

Abstract = {Objectives. We examined associations between specific public open space
   (POS) attributes and recreational walking to local POS.
   Methods. Between October 2004 and December 2006, 1465 adults of the
   RESIDential Environments Project, conducted in Perth, Australia,
   reported whether they walk to a POS for recreation. For each
   participant, we identified all open spaces larger than 0.8 hectares
   within 1.6 kilometers from home. On the basis of field audit data, we
   created 3 scores (presence, count, size-weighted presence) for 19
   specific open space attributes.
   Results. With logistic regression analyses, we found that walking to a
   POS was associated with the presence of gardens, grassed areas, walking
   paths, water features, wildlife, amenities, dog-related facilities, and
   off-leash areas for dogs. It was also associated with the highest number
   of these attributes in a single open space, but not with the total
   number of attributes in all POSs within 1.6 kilometers of home.
   Conclusions. Building 1 high-quality local park may be more effective in
   promoting recreational walking than is providing many average-quality
   parks.},

   wildlife behavior, possibilities for farming and gardening, and
   byproducts of construction like noise, pollution, and excavation.
   However, what we argue is crucial to examine is the emotional toll that
   these changes have taken on rural residents. Interviewees chose to live
   in West Virginia because of deep enchantment with the surrounding
   natural beauty, which they feel they have lost due to energy
   development. While energy research has been dominated by technical

   dingo management or address potential dingo human conflicts during urban
   planning. From GPS tracking data, the nine dingoes, predominately
   juvenile and female, we tracked lived within 700 m of residential homes
   at all times and frequently crossed roads, visited backyards and
   traversed built-up areas. Home range sizes ranged between 0.37 km(2) and
   100.32 km(2). Dingoes were mostly nocturnal, averaging 591 m/h between
   dusk and dawn. Juvenile and adult dingoes spent up to 19\% and 72\% of
   their time in urban habitats. Fresh scats from most areas surveyed
   tested positive to a variety of common zoonoses. These data suggest
   dingoes are capable of exploiting pen-urban areas and might contribute
   to human health and safety risks, the significance of which remains
   unknown. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Human alterations to the environment can exert strong evolutionary
   pressures, yet contemporary adaptation to human-mediated stressors is
   rarely documented in wildlife populations. A common-garden experimental
   design was coupled with comparative transcriptomics to discover evolved
   mechanisms enabling three populations of killifish resident in urban
   estuaries to survive normally lethal pollution exposure during
   development, and to test whether mechanisms are unique or common across
   populations. We show that killifish populations from these polluted
   sites have independently converged on a common adaptive mechanism,
   despite variation in contaminant profiles among sites. These populations
   are united by a similarly profound desensitization of aryl-hydrocarbon
   receptor-mediated transcriptional activation, which is associated with
   extreme tolerance to the lethal effects of toxic dioxin-like pollutants.
   The rapid, repeated, heritable and convergent nature of evolved
   tolerance suggests that ancestral killifish populations harboured
   genotypes that enabled adaptation to twentieth-century industrial
   pollutants.},

   bird},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {213},
Number = {A},
Pages = {42-50},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Understanding how introduced plants reduce food web complexity is
   critical to effective conservation management within human-dominated
   systems. In urban breeding birds, the paucity of dietary specialists
   suggests that a lack of food resources, such as arthropod prey essential
   for reproduction and survival, may contribute to bird declines. Local
   plant species composition and abundance is influenced by the landscaping
   decisions of private homeowners and may be contributing to differences
   in insect prey availability. In this study, we examined whether
   non-native plants are a limiting factor to a resident breeding
   insectivore, the Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). We used
   caterpillar counts, chickadee foraging observations and
   detection-corrected hierarchical models, to determine the influence of
   local landscaping features on insect food availability, chickadee tree
   preference, site occupancy, site abundance and breeding territory
   selection. Native plants were more likely to host a higher biomass of
   caterpillars compared to non-native plants, and chickadees strongly
   preferred to forage in native plants that supported the most
   caterpillars. In addition, chickadees were less likely to breed in yards
   as the dominance of non-native plants increased. Chickadee occupancy
   increased with tree basal area and chickadee abundance declined as
   impermeable surface area increased and basal area decreased. Our results
   demonstrate that non-native plants reduce habitat suitability for
   chickadees by reducing insect food available for breeding. Improving
   human-dominated landscapes as wildlife habitat should include increasing
   native, and arthropod-producing, plant species to effectively support
   the life history needs of insectivorous birds.},

Title = {Municipal regulation of residential landscapes across US cities:
   Patterns and implications for landscape sustainability},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {275},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Local regulations on residential landscapes (yards and gardens) can
   facilitate or constrain ecosystem services and disservices in cities. To
   our knowledge, no studies have undertaken a comprehensive look at how
   municipalities regulate residential landscapes to achieve particular
   goals and to control management practices. Across six U.S. cities, we
   analyzed 156 municipal ordinances to examine regional patterns in local
   landscape regulations and their implications for sustainability.
   Specifically, we conducted content analysis to capture regulations aimed
   at: 1) goals pertaining to conservation and environmental management,
   aesthetics and nuisance avoidance, and health and wellbeing, and 2)
   management actions including vegetation maintenance, water and waste
   management, food production, and chemical inputs. Our results reveal
   significant variation in local and regional regulations. While
   regulatory goals stress stormwater management and nuisance avoidance,
   relatively few municipalities explicitly regulate residential yards to
   maintain property values, mitigate heat, or avoid allergens. Meanwhile,
   biological conservation and water quality protection are common goals,
   yet regulations on yard management practices (e.g., non-native plants or
   chemical inputs) sometimes contradict these purposes. In addition,
   regulations emphasizing aesthetics and the maintenance of vegetation,
   mowing of grass and weeds, as well as the removal of dead wood, may
   inhibit wildlife-friendly yards. As a whole, landscaping ordinances
   largely ignore tradeoffs between interacting goals and outcomes, thereby
   limiting their potential to support landscape sustainability.
   Recommendations therefore include coordinated, multiobjective planning
   through partnerships among planners, developers, researchers, and
   non-government entities at multiple scales.},

Abstract = {The contribution to urban green space by private or domestic gardens in
   residential zones was investigated in the city of Sheffield, UK, as part
   of a wider study of the garden resource and its associated biodiversity.
   The attributes of 61 gardens, including patterns of landcover and
   vegetation cover, were explored in relation to housing characteristics
   and the nature of the surrounding landscape. The number of surrounding
   houses, and the areas of buildings and of roads were negatively
   correlated with garden area. The proportion of a housing parcel
   comprising garden increased with parcel size, although the proportion
   that was rear garden remained relatively constant. Garden size played an
   overwhelming role in determining garden composition: larger gardens
   supported more landcovers, contained greater extents of three-quarters
   of the recorded landcovers, and were more likely to contain trees taller
   than 2 m, vegetable patches, and composting sites. Unvegetated
   landcovers made greater proportional contributions as garden size
   declined. All categories of vegetation canopy increased with garden
   size, and large gardens supported disproportionately greater cover above
   3 m. House age was a less significant factor determining garden
   landcover. Gardens of newer houses were more likely to occur towards the
   edge of the urban area, and older properties, that contained fewer
   hedges, possessed less canopy between 2-3 m. The extent and occurrence
   of different landcovers in gardens, and their consequences for wildlife,
   are considered for residential patches in urban areas. The implications
   for urban planners are discussed.},

Abstract = {The burgeoning application of fertilizers and pesticides to residential

   the United States and elsewhere. Increased use and purchase occur
   specifically among a sector of consumers who explicitly and

   and human health. What drives the production of monocultural lawns in a
   period when environmental consciousness has encouraged ``green{''}

   the interactions that condition and characterize the growth of intensive
   residential yard management in the United States. We argue that the
   peculiar growth and expansion of the moral economy of the lawn is the
   product of a threefold process in which (1) the lawn-chemical industry
   has implemented new and innovative styles of marketing that (2) help to
   produce an association of community, family, and environmental health

Abstract = {Human-dominated landscapes represent one of the most rapidly expanding
   and least-understood ecosystems on earth. Yet, we know little about
   which features in these landscapes promote sustainable wildlife
   populations. Historically, in urban areas, landowners have converted
   native plant communities into habitats dominated by nonnative species
   that are not susceptible to pest damage and require little maintenance.
   However, nonnative plants are also poor at supporting insects that are
   critical food resources for higher order consumers. Despite the logical
   connection, no study has examined the impact of nonnative plants on
   subsequent population responses of vertebrate consumers. Here, we
   demonstrate that residential yards dominated by nonnative plants have
   lower arthropod abundance, forcing resident Carolina chickadees (Poecile
   carolinensis) to switch diets to less preferred prey and produce fewer
   young, or forgo reproduction in nonnative sites altogether. This leads
   to lower reproductive success and unsustainable population growth in
   these yards compared with those with >70\% native plant biomass. Our
   results reveal that properties landscaped with nonnative plants function
   as population sinks for insectivorous birds. To promote sustainable food
   webs, urban planners and private landowners should prioritize native
   plant species.},

Abstract = {Residential yardscapes are at the forefront of human interaction with
   nature for those living in urban areas across Europe and North America.
   In recent years a significant amount of research has investigated urban
   green spaces using the ecosystem services framework (ES) along with
   ecosystem disservices (ED) and how such spaces deliver urban ecosystem
   services (UES). However, a gap exists in understanding how ES and ED
   manifest themselves in the more specific context of residential
   yardscapes. Specifically, do homeowners conceptualize ES and ED when
   talking about their yards without specific prompts to reflect services
   and disservices? The current work presents a case study of homeowners in
   the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota, United States.
   We used two associated surveys to elicit responses related to
   homeowners' yards. Without prompting, homeowner conceptualizations of
   their yardscapes reflected all ES categories with cultural (CES) (e.g.,
   family recreation) and provisioning (PES) (e.g., vegetable cultivation)
   services cited most often. Homeowners also mentioned ED associated with
   their own or a neighbor's yard (e.g., attraction of nuisance wildlife).
   Their plans for yardscapes indicated largely incremental changes (e.g.,
   putting in a new planting bed) vs. drastic shifts (e.g., complete
   replacement of turfgrass with alternative vegetation). This case study
   illustrates that the homeowners' conceptualizations of their yards do
   indeed reflect current ES \& ED frameworks without specific prompting.
   The ES framework, combined with the identified leverage points, can be a
   fruitful approach for enhancing UES and minimizing ED within residential
   yardscapes.},

Volume = {142},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The human population is increasingly disconnected from nature due to
   urbanisation. To counteract this phenomenon, the UK government has been
   actively promoting wildlife gardening. However, the extent to which such
   activities are conducted and the level of resource provision for
   biodiversity (e.g., food and nesting sites) within domestic gardens
   remains poorly documented. Here we generate estimates for a selection of
   key resources provided within gardens at a national scale, using 12
   survey datasets gathered across the UK. We estimate that 22.7 million
   households (87\% of homes) have access to a garden. Average garden SiZe
   is 190 m(2), extrapolating to a total area of 432,924 ha. Although
   substantial, this coverage is still an order of magnitude less than that
   of statutory protected areas. Approximately 12.6 million (48\%)
   households provide supplementary food for birds, 7.4 million of which
   specifically use bird feeders. Similarly, there are a minimum of 4.7
   million nest boxes within gardens. These figures equate to one bird
   feeder for every nine potentially feeder-using birds in the UK, and at
   least one nest box for every six breeding pairs of cavity nesting birds.
   Gardens also contain 2.5-3.5 million ponds and 28.7 million trees, which
   is just under a quarter of all trees occurring outside woodlands.
   Ongoing urbanisation, characterised by increased housing densities, is
   inevitable throughout the UK and elsewhere. The important contribution
   domestic gardens make to the green space infrastructure in residential
   areas must be acknowledged, as their reduction will impact biodiversity
   conservation, ecosystem services, and the well-being of the human
   population. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Understanding patterns of habitat selection and factors affecting space
   use is fundamental in animal conservation. In urban landscapes, such
   knowledge can be used to advise householders on how best to manage their
   gardens for wildlife. In this study, we tracked 28 West European
   hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), a species of conservation concern in
   the UK, in an area of high-density housing using radio and GPS tags to
   quantify patterns of habitat use and identify factors associated with
   the proportion of time spent in individual gardens. Both males and
   females exhibited a preference for residential gardens, but there were
   subtle differences between the sexes in relation to house type and front
   versus back gardens. Hedgehogs spent significantly more time in gardens
   where artificial food was provided, where a compost heap was present, if
   foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were infrequent visitors, if it rained overnight
   and as daylength increased (i.e., shorter nights); garden use was not
   significantly associated with variables potentially likely to reflect
   invertebrate prey abundance. These data suggest that the primary
   positive action that householders can undertake for urban hedgehogs is
   providing supplementary food. However, householders often feed hedgehogs
   after they know they are already visiting their garden. Consequently,
   the presence of artificial food may make it difficult to identify other
   important influences affecting garden use. Finally, we report that a GPS
   fix acquisition rate < 60\% likely had no major effect on the results of
   our analyses, but should be a consideration in future studies using this
   technique on this species and in this habitat.},

Abstract = {Across Europe, hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) appear to be in decline
   in both urban and rural landscapes. Current methods used to monitor
   urban populations are, however, associated with several potential
   limitations. In this study, we conducted hedgehog footprint-tunnel
   surveys in 219 residential gardens across Reading, UK between
   May-September in 2013 and/or 2014; gardens were surveyed for five
   continuous days. Single-species occupancy models were used to
   investigate factors influencing hedgehog occupancy and two-species
   occupancy models were used to estimate a species interaction factor
   (SIF) between hedgehogs and (a) badgers (Meles meles), (b) foxes (Vulpes
   vulpes) and (c) dogs (Canis familiaris). The five-day survey protocol
   was associated with a false-absence error rate of 0.1-0.4\%, indicating
   that it was a reliable method for determining hedgehog presence;
   conversely, 34.7\% of householders were not able to correctly predict
   hedgehog presence or absence. Hedgehogs were widely distributed across
   Reading, but detected in only 32-40\% of gardens. None of the
   within-garden or outside-garden factors investigated significantly
   affected hedgehog occupancy in the single-species models, but the
   two-species models indicated that badgers (SIF=0.471 +/- 0.188), but not
   foxes (SIF=0.954 +/- 0.048) or dogs (SIF=0.780 +/- 0.228), negatively
   affected the presence of hedgehogs in gardens, although not
   significantly. Overall, footprint-tunnels represent a viable field
   method for monitoring urban hedgehog populations, however, other
   approaches are required to identify factors that make gardens hedgehog
   friendly.},

Abstract = {Context Tree canopy connectivity is important for supporting
   biodiversity. In urban landscapes, empirical examinations of habitat
   connectivity often overlook residential land, though yards and gardens
   often comprise a large portion of urban forests. Objectives We quantify
   structural composition (patches and paths), connectivity and
   fragmentation of an entire tree canopy network spanning 1220 Boston's
   neighborhoods to assess the configuration of the urban forest
   potentially affecting tree-dependent wildlife species, such as some
   birds and arboreal mammals. Methods The urban landscape was classified
   by land use, and residential yards were further subdivided into front
   yards, backyards, and corner yards. Structural composition, connectivity
   and fragmentation of the tree canopy was assessed using morphological
   spatial pattern and network analysis. Canopy metrics were then related
   to the land use of 349,305 property parcels. Results Back yard tree
   canopy cover was 65.23\%. The majority of canopy links were on
   residential land (60.95\% total), and particularly in backyards. Back
   yards contained the highest number of canopy fragments (48.65\% total).
   Fragmentation of the canopy network peaked at similar to 23\% of total
   canopy cover. Canopy fragmentation, distance among patches and their
   shape complexity were lower in neighborhoods with more tree canopy.
   Conclusions The important role that yards have in sustaining canopy
   connectivity across urban landscapes poses challenges and opportunities.
   Urban land management and planning need to protect connectivity links
   within urban forests when located on private residential realm. A
   prioritization strategy aimed at expanding urban tree cover could focus
   on yards to ensure that urban landscape connectivity is maintained and
   increased.},

   vegetation structure as the most important challenges facing bird
   conservation in cities. We follow with an overview of the stakeholders
   in cities, and identify six main groups having the greatest potential to
   improve bird survival in cities: i) urban planners, urban designers and
   (landscape) architects, ii) urban developers and engineers, iii)
   homeowners and tenants, iv) companies and industries, v) landscaping and
   gardening firms, vi) education professionals. Given that motivation to
   act positively for urban birds is linked to stakeholder-specific advice,
   we present ten statements for bird-friendly cities that are guided by an
   action perspective and argument for each stakeholder group. We conclude
   with a discussion on how the use of stakeholder-specific arguments can

Abstract = {The 558 prey items brought home by one domestic cat, recorded over its
   17-year lifetime, included 221 mice, 63 rats, 35 rabbits, 4 hares and 2
   weasels. The cat hunted up to 600 m from the house, and prey was caught
   both inside and outside the 0.5 ha garden. Of the 223 birds brought in,
   54 were native, including 43 silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis), but those
   killed were quickly replaced, so there was always a resident population
   of 1-2 pairs. The other known native birds comprised five fantails
   (Rhipidura fuliginosa), four warblers (Gerygone igata), a kingfisher
   (Halcyon sancta), and a shining cuckoo (Chrysococcyx lucidus). Only nine
   skinks (Cyclodina aenea) and one frog (Litoria raniformis) were brought
   in. The abundance of birds and reptiles in the garden showed no apparent
   change over the 17 years compared with the previous 15-year-period

Abstract = {Home food gardening is an important component of urban agriculture and
   sustainable food systems. However, globally there has been limited
   research into the barriers and enablers to home food gardening in
   cities. This study used an exploratory approach, utilising a
   questionnaire survey of households, and in-depth interviews with
   gardening experts, to assess barriers and enablers to home food
   gardening in the City of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. Overall, nine
   themes were identified that were common across both survey and interview
   data. These were time, cost, space, knowledge, ownership, soil, wildlife
   and pests, mobility, support and access, and community. Barriers vary
   depending on individual circumstances and are often compounding. Our
   results indicate that while many households are now growing food, or are
   interested in growing food, there are limitations on the percentage of
   food intake that households can grow at home. Key factors to growing
   more food include control over property, available land, and gardening
   experience and know-how. Our findings highlight the need for policy,
   programs, and resources, especially at the level of local governments,
   that can contribute to an increase in the amount of local, home grown
   food in cities.},

   three major districts of Ilheus, with 37\% of positive questionnaires (n

   associated with secondary forest fragments, backyards with fruit trees
   and mangroves. Marmosets travel among urban fragments using electrical
   and phone wires and crossing roads. There is a relatively small number
   of accidents when compared to the number of sightings, with
   electrocution as the most common. Visitation of marmosets to households,
   attracted by food provisioning, was considered frequent. People feel
   pity for the marmosets and lure them to their houses through food, but
   offered items are not always suitable. Marmoset exploration of uncommon
   habitats, such as mangroves, might be driven by a lack of larger forest
   fragments within the city.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In Scotland, residents have fought open-net salmon farms and their toll
   on human and nonhuman bodies for decades. This paper recollects seven
   years of work in Skye and Raasay, two islands off the northwest coast of
   the country, developing strategies to divest away from salmon
   aquaculture. Addressing the contemporary wave of underwater clearances
   created by UK's top food export industry, it unpacks the implementation
   of a transition into alternative horizons by embracing the legacies of
   toxicity inherited from salmon extractivist industries. CLIMAVORE, a
   framework developed as a research-led artistic practice by the authors,
   investigates how to eat in the new seasons of the climate crisis. In a
   season of marine dead zones, it facilitates new approaches to
   aquaecology and coastal care that cultivate coastal livelihoods.
   CLIMAVORE began with a new public forum, shaped as a multispecies
   intertidal table, established in Skye in 2017 to envision
   environmentally regenerative and socially reparative forms of food
   production based on metabolic interactions between humans and depleted
   landscapes that benefit a plethora of species. CLIMAVORE's site
   responsive methodology relies on a socially-engaged art practice,
   consisting of fieldwork, interviews, working groups, oral histories,
   performative meals, cooking and building apprenticeships, tidal
   gardening, material testing and public art installations. Ongoing
   collaboration with residents, scientists, and policymakers critically
   explores ways of living not only on but with the coast. This new
   holistic approach to coastal nourishment provides methodologies for
   ecological praxis as well as a platform for researchers and the general
   public to imagine an alternative ecological future: the tidal commons.},

Abstract = {A comprehensive approach to reducing landscape water use was implemented

   processes of a mini-watershed. The soil is now able to soak up and
   retain rainwater, reducing the need for supplemental irrigation and
   eliminating urban runoff. Habitat and food for wildlife was introduced,
   and maintenance costs were minimized by reducing green waste and
   eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and
   pesticides. The installation was supplemented by two classes offered
   free to the public: a three hour introduction to California Friendly
   Landscaping principles, and a half day hands-on workshop in which
   participants used their newly-acquired knowledge to plant California
   natives and install drip irrigation. California native plantings were
   selected for their long-lasting and colorful blooms to introduce the

Abstract = {Urban landscapes present substantial opportunities for biodiversity
   conservation with residential gardens offering some of the greatest
   potential conservation gains given that they represent a significant
   proportion of the total greenspace in urbanised landscapes. However,
   knowledge of wildlife ecology within gardens remains scarce, likely due
   to the difficulties associated with field ecologists accessing privately
   owned areas. Citizen-sourced data presents an alternative approach to
   typical field-based investigations and could be used to develop an
   extensive understanding of biodiversity within privately owned green
   spaces, providing concerns of data unreliability could be overcome. Here
   we i) examine the potential for urban householders to identify a
   threatened nocturnal mammal, in the presence of a similar non-threatened
   species, ii) examine which attributes can predict the level of accuracy
   in householders' species identifications and iii) investigate how their
   self-reported level of certainty affects identification reliability. We
   found up to 80\% agreement between householders and experienced
   ecologists when we assessed presence and absence of nocturnal mammals on
   urban properties. The amount of time a householder had lived at their
   residence was a significant predictor of accuracy for mammal species
   identification, suggesting that familiarity with a site enhances the
   accuracy of citizen science data. Those people with a high level of
   certainty in their ability to correctly identify nocturnal mammals were
   no more likely to show higher species identification accuracy than those
   with low certainty. In urban areas, where ecological surveys for
   nocturnal taxa are especially challenging, our results inspire optimism
   that householders can add to the body of knowledge about biodiversity
   persisting in these landscapes, especially on properties where they have
   resided for at least one year.},

   the home range. Home ranges of juvenile foxes were significantly smaller
   than home ranges of adult foxes. Gender-specific differences among adult
   foxes were not established. A minimum population density of 2.7 foxes
   per km(2) and summer densities of up to 13.4 foxes per km(2) were
   calculated. Therefore, the fox density was three to eight times higher
   than that of strictly rural foxes. Daytime resting sites of foxes were
   mostly found in forests (62.2\%) and reedbed areas (20.6\%). Of the
   resting sites, 14.8\% were situated inside settlements, in fallow
   gardens or gardens of residents. During the day, foxes exhibited habitat
   preferences for forests and reedbed areas. A habitat structure that
   offers plenty of cover or dense vegetation is essential for its

Abstract = {The extent and continued expansion of urbanisation has focused attention
   on the significance for native biodiversity of those green spaces
   remaining within such areas and the most appropriate methods of managing
   them. In the UK, a high proportion of urban space is comprised of the
   private or domestic gardens associated with residential dwellings, and
   many recommendations have been made for simple changes to improve their
   value for biodiversity ('wildlife gardening'). Here, we report the
   results of replicated experimental tests of five such common
   recommendations, involving the introduction to gardens of (i) artificial
   nest sites for solitary bees and wasps; (ii) artificial nest sites for
   bumblebees; (iii) small ponds; (iv) dead wood for fungi and other
   saproxylic organisms; and ( v) patches of nettles Urtica dioica L. for
   butterfly larvae. The broad conclusion is that whilst some methods for
   increasing the biodiversity of garden environments may be very
   effective, others have a low probability of success on the timescales
   and spatial scales likely to be acceptable to many garden owners. If one
   of the functions of small scale biodiversity enhancement is to develop
   and encourage awareness of biodiversity and its conservation, then

Abstract = {The conservation of biological diversity in landscapes dominated by
   human use is emerging as an increasingly significant challenge, given
   the rate at which the Earth's remaining vegetation resources are being
   lost. Whilst traditional approaches to conservation have relied upon the
   ability of species to persist within the scattered fragments to which
   they have been confined, recent scientific evidence suggests that the
   long-term viability of fragmented populations may only be secured
   through the establishment of ecological connectivity between existing
   fragments.
   In the absence of a suitable methodology within which to design
   connective habitat configurations, a conceptual approach to landscape
   design was devised for a highly urbanised environment within the
   Shellharbour Local Government Area (LGA), New South Wales (NSW). This
   approach utilises beneficial landscape attributes advocated in the
   literature, and tailors existing rapid assessment methodologies
   traditionally used to provide simple measures of ecosystem health. Using
   this methodology, conservationally significant stepping-stone sites were
   identified between selected terminal habitat patches. The determination
   of an optimal corridor configuration linking these patches was found to
   heavily utilise riparian habitat and adjacent residential yard space.
   Planting endemic species in these areas will support ecological flow by
   increasing the area of core habitat relative to edge habitat. (c) 2008

Abstract = {Collection-based institutions-zoos, aquariums, museums, and botanical
   gardens-exhibit wildlife and thus have a special connection with nature.
   Many of these institutions emphasize a mission of conservation, and,
   undeniably, they do contribute directly to conservation education and
   conservation science. They present an exceptional opportunity for many
   urban residents to see the wonders of life, and they can contribute to
   education and habitat preservation. Because many collection-based
   institutions now hold a stated mission of conservation, we suggest eight
   potential questions to evaluate actions toward that mission: (1) Does
   conservation thought define policy decisions? (2) Is there sufficient
   organizational funding for conservation activities? (3) Is there a
   functional conservation department? (4) Does the institution advocate
   for conservation? (5) Do conservation education programs effectively
   target children and adults? (6) Does the institution contribute directly
   to habitat protection locally and internationally? (7) Do exhibits
   explain and promote conservation efforts? and (8) Do internal policies
   and activities protect the environment? These questions are offered as a
   place to begin discussion. We hope they will help employees and
   administrators of a collection-based institution (and citizens of the
   surrounding community) think about and support their institution's
   conservation activities. Public support and praise for institutions that
   are striving toward solutions for conservation problems and pressure on
   organizations that are moving more slowly toward a conservation
   orientation can help shift more resources toward saving nature.},

Abstract = {Red foxes thrive in towns and cities, where much of their food is
   deliberately provided by humans. We studied fox foraging behavior using
   camera traps in residential gardens where householders regularly fed
   foxes. Predictable feeding patterns attracted foxes to gardens, females
   were more efficient foragers than males, and dominant foxes enjoyed
   priority access to food, so that subordinates had to adopt compensatory
   strategies. Understanding how foxes exploit resources may help address
   conflicts in urban areas. In patchy environments, foragers adopt
   different strategies to acquire resources depending on their internal
   state and external physical and social environment: this has important
   fitness consequences. Linking individual variation in patch use to
   tangible characteristics is key to understand many higher-level
   ecological processes. We studied patch use by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes)
   in the city of Bristol, UK. We placed camera traps in gardens where
   householders provisioned foxes (patches) to investigate whether 1) foxes
   discriminated between patches based on food availability, quantified as
   provisioning frequency (predictability) and the energy value of
   provisioned food; and 2) individual patch use varied with dominance,
   gender, and season. Increased frequency of provisioning encouraged more
   foxes to visit and to stay longer in patches. All foxes visited the most
   predictable patches first each day, but females were more selective and
   generally more efficient foragers than males. Females increased foraging
   effort during cub rearing, whereas males reduced patch use in the
   dispersal and mating season. Dominants and subordinates shared patches
   spatiotemporally, possibly facilitated by relatedness and familiarity
   between group members. However, dominants visited more food patches on
   their territory, spent more time in predictable patches and fed earlier
   than subordinates. Subordinates may compensate for competition by
   visiting patches of lower quality or outside their territory, which is
   inefficient and risky. Our results demonstrate gender differences in
   behavioral motivation, show how subordinates forego foraging efficiency
   to mitigate intra-group competition and reveal how human provisioning
   influences fox space use in urban areas.},

Abstract = {Food availability is a primary driver of avian population regulation.
   However, few studies have considered the effects of what is essentially
   a massive supplementary feeding experiment: the practice of wild bird
   feeding. Bird feeding has been posited as an important factor
   influencing the structure of bird communities, especially in urban
   areas, although experimental evidence to support this is almost entirely
   lacking. We carried out an 18-mo experimental feeding study at 23
   residential properties to investigate the effects of bird feeding on
   local urban avian assemblages. Our feeding regime was based on
   predominant urban feeding practices in our region. We used monthly bird
   surveys to compare avian community composition, species richness, and
   the densities of local species at feeding and nonfeeding properties.
   Avian community structure diverged at feeding properties and five of the
   commonest garden bird species were affected by the experimental feeding
   regime. Introduced birds particularly benefitted, with dramatic
   increases observed in the abundances of house sparrow (Passer
   domesticus) and spotted dove (Streptopelia chinensis) in particular. We
   also found evidence of a negative effect on the abundance of a native
   insectivore, the grey warbler (Gerygone igata). Almost all of the
   observed changes did not persist once feeding had ceased. Our study
   directly demonstrates that the human pastime of bird feeding
   substantially contributes to the structure of avian community in urban
   areas, potentially altering the balance between native and introduced
   species.},

Abstract = {The combination of increasing numbers of people in cities, coupled with
   decreasing levels of biodiversity, is hypothesised to result in the
   extinction of experience, or the continued disintegration of the human
   relationship with the natural world. We use the concepts of sense of
   place and dwelling to investigate the human relationship with nature in
   cities by considering the emotional connections between people and
   places. We conducted `goalong' interviews with 21 residents of Hamilton,
   New Zealand, to explore the significance of neighbourhood parks and home
   gardens in the lives of urban residents. Our study highlights the
   importance of greenspaces in cities to the physical, mental and social
   health of local residents. Bush parks provided the best opportunities
   for respondents to observe nature and thereby escape the stress of city
   life. Participants wanted a variety of parks which would meet the range
   of their community's needs and provide habitat for wildlife. Proximity
   and frequent use of parks resulted in a sense of ownership and
   responsibility which led to concrete action, such as participation in
   ecological restoration of valued greenspaces. Providing high quality
   natural greenspaces within walking distance of residents' homes disrupts
   the extinction of experience by fostering positive personal experiences
   of nature, crucial for the health and wellbeing of people and for native

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly modified Earth's social-ecological
   systems in many ways; here we study its impacts on human-nature
   interactions. We conducted an online survey focused on peoples'
   relationships with the non-human world during the pandemic and received
   valid responses from 3,204 adult residents of the state of Vermont
   (U.S.A.). We analyzed reported changes in outdoor activities and the
   values associated with human-nature relationships across geographic
   areas and demographic characteristics. We find that participation
   increased on average for some activities (foraging, gardening, hiking,
   jogging, photography and other art, relaxing alone, walking, and
   watching wildlife), and decreased for others (camping, relaxing with
   others). The values respondents ranked as more important during the
   pandemic factored into two groups, which we label as ``Nurture and
   Recreation values{''} and ``Inspiration and Nourishment values.{''}
   Using multinomial logistic regression, we found that respondents'
   preferences for changes in activity engagement and value factors are
   statistically associated with some demographic characteristics,
   including geography, gender, income, and employment status during the
   pandemic. Our results suggest that nature may play an important role in
   coping during times of crisis, but that the specific interactions and
   associated values that people perceive as most important may vary
   between populations. Our findings emphasize for both emergency and
   natural resources planning the importance of understanding variation in
   how and why people interact with and benefit from nature during crises.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {224},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Native plant landscaping can provide unique support for native wildlife
   in urban settings, but the drivers of native plant inclusion in private
   residential yards are not well characterized. As with other
   pro-environmental behaviors, native plant landscaping is likely driven
   by a combination of resident and landscape attributes. We ask, how do
   resident attitudes, knowledge, plant choice priorities, demographics,
   and parcel structure predict existing native plant abundance? To address
   this question, we compared resident characteristics with front yard
   woody vegetation in 105 parcels in Phoenix, Arizona. Although many
   residents had positive attitudes toward native plants, less than a third
   of woody plants in most yards were native. Native woody plant abundance
   was higher in xeric rock-covered yards where residents believed native
   plants belonged in the city, prioritized choosing native plants, and had
   higher household income. Reported knowledge about native plants was low,
   but did not predict native woody plant abundance. Although native plants
   in the arid environment of Phoenix are adapted to low water conditions,
   residents who prioritized low water use plant selection had fewer native
   plants, highlighting an opportunity for native plant marketing. These
   results suggest that educational campaigns to increase resident
   knowledge of native plant identification and care are unlikely to result
   in greater native plant abundance in the residential landscape.
   Marketing native plants to highlight qualities such as low water needs
   and addressing barriers such as horticultural availability and expense
   should be further investigated as potential methods of increasing native
   plant resources in urban environments.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary The protection of pollinating insects depends on public
   support. Citizen science (CS) is frequently discussed as a way to
   promote interest and conservation action for pollinators. In cities, the
   drivers behind pollinator-friendly behaviour are largely unclear. We
   surveyed 111 community gardeners in Berlin and Munich, Germany, some of
   which were participating in a citizen science project. We created four
   different sets of generalized linear models to analyse how the
   gardeners' pro-pollinator behaviour intentions and behaviour were
   explained by the gardener's identity, emotions towards pollinators,
   attitudes towards pollinators and nature-relatedness. Respondents who
   were fascinated by pollinators, held positive attitudes, and felt joy
   about seeing pollinators reported intentions to protect or support
   pollinators. Similarly, joy about seeing pollinators was a predictor of
   participation in the CS project. We believe that CS may represent a
   pathway through which urban residents may become key actors in
   conservation projects within their nearby greenspaces. The conservation
   of pollinators requires social understanding to catalyse restoration
   action. Citizen science (CS) is discussed as a way to promote interest
   and action for pollinating insects. Yet, the drivers behind
   pro-pollinator behaviour are largely unclear, especially in urban areas.
   To better understand public engagement in pollinator conservation, we
   studied urban community gardeners' identity, nature-relatedness,
   emotions, and attitudes toward pollinators and their intentions to get
   involved in pro-pollinator behaviour in their gardening practice. We
   surveyed community gardeners in Berlin and Munich, Germany, some of
   which were participating in a citizen science project. In this
   scientific study, we created four different sets of generalized linear
   models to analyse how the gardeners' pro-pollinator behaviour intentions

   responses of 111 gardeners revealed that gardeners that were fascinated
   by pollinators, held positive attitudes and felt joy about seeing
   pollinators reported intentions to protect or support pollinators,
   suggesting that fascination and joy can be harnessed for research and
   conservation on pollinators. Similarly, joy about seeing pollinators
   predicted participation in the CS project. We believe that CS may

Abstract = {Urban agriculture is a unique form of agriculture that can provide
   fresh, local produce for urban residents, and may benefit biodiversity
   by decreasing the need to expand agriculture into natural areas as well
   as enhancing biodiversity in urban areas. However, although urban
   agriculture is also often cited as promoting biodiversity in urban
   areas, the extent of empirical evidence for such claims has not been
   studied. Here we systematically review the relationship between urban
   agriculture and biodiversity in the scientific literature. We strictly
   define urban agriculture as areas in cities that grow produce
   specifically for human consumption. We examined 148 papers from 2000 to
   2017, of which only 24 studies fit our definition of urban agriculture,
   and of those, only 18 both involved urban agriculture and measured
   biodiversity. Of the studies that did measure biodiversity, some showed
   increases in diversity compared to urban vacant lots, but other showed
   no difference. Moreover, these studies were mostly focused on plants and
   invertebrates and were conducted almost exclusively in North America. In
   order to use the generalization that urban agriculture will have a
   positive influence on urban biodiversity, more studies will need to be
   conducted across a wider geographic range worldwide (particularly in
   developing countries in the tropics) and on a greater diversity of
   species and taxa (e.g., herpetiles, birds and small mammals). Such
   studies will likely increase in conservation importance as urban

   2 yr of a long-term study of ground arthropods of Phoenix, AZ, focusing
   on the communities assembled in agricultural fields, commercial sites,

   residential yards generally supported the greatest number of individuals

   in indicator species analysis. Thus, of the urban habitats, two heavily
   irrigated and highly productive land use types seem to stand apart from
   the others in most community measures. Outlying desert sites also
   supported significantly associated taxa, including those not found
   regularly in desert parks and members of higher trophic levels less

   supported similar taxon richness. Xeric residential yards and commercial
   sites did not support any taxa not found in other land use types. While
   our results may be dependent on the location of Phoenix in the
   water-limited Sonoran Desert, we urge broader consideration of highly
   modified urban landscapes as wildlife habitat.},

Abstract = {1,3-Diphenylguanidine (DPG), benzothiazole (BTH), benzotriazole (BTR),

   this, little is known about the occurrence of these chemicals in
   roadside soils. In this study, we determined the concentrations,
   profiles, and distribution patterns of 3 DPGs, 5 BTHs, and 7 BTRs in 110
   soil samples collected from northeastern United States. We found
   widespread occurrence of 12 out of the 15 analytes measured in roadside
   soils, at detection frequencies >= 71 \% and median concentrations in
   the range of 0.38-380 ng/g (dry weight). DPGs were the predominant
   chemicals accounting for 63 \% of the sum concentrations of three
   chemical classes determined, followed by BTHs (28 \%) and BTRs (9 \%).
   The concentrations of all analytes (except for 1-, 4-, and 5-OH-BTRs)
   exhibited significant positive correlations (r: 0.1-0.9, p < 0.01),

   Higher concentrations of DPGs, BTHs and BTRs were found in soils from
   highways, rubberized playgrounds, and indoor parking lots than those
   from gardens, parks, and residential areas. Our findings suggest the
   release of DPGs, BTHs and BTRs from rubber products, especially
   auto-mobile tires. Further studies are needed to investigate the

   home ranges and monitored tree phenology to calculate fruit and seed
   availability indices. Monkeys from both groups consumed large quantities
   of exotic plant species, accounting for > 50\% of their overall annual
   diet, with seeds of the invasive black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) the most
   commonly consumed exotic species followed by acorns of two oak species
   (Quercus robur and Q. palustris.). However, monkeys responded to the
   availability of indigenous rather than exotic fruits and seeds and
   increased their consumption of exotics when indigenous fruits were less
   available. Although monkeys spent less time moving when feeding on
   exotic species compared to indigenous species, eating exotics did not
   free up monkeys' time to rest or socialize, as additional time was
   required to process exotic foods. To offset the possible negative
   consequences of the monkeys' reliance on exotic seeds, including
   escalating conflict between monkeys and people in gardens, we suggest
   gradual removal of exotic plant species in the habitat and replacement
   with indigenous species as one mitigation strategy.},

Abstract = {Loss of nesting habitat due to urbanization and development has been
   identified as a primary threat to Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii),
   but this species can successfully nest in some urbanized areas. Hence,
   understanding the features of urban areas that promote occupancy by
   Cooper's hawks may become important in managing for the species. We
   measured nest tree, site, slid area features at 49 Cooper's hawk nests
   representing 33 breeding pairs in Tucson, Arizona between 1993 and 1996.
   Introduced eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.; 70.8\%), aleppo pine (Pinus
   halepensis; 25.0\%), and native cottonwood trees (Populus fremontii;
   4.2\%) were used as nest trees to a greater extent than expected based
   on their availability (P < 0.001). Urban nest trees were taller and of
   greater diameter than random trees. Nest sites (0.08 ha) were
   characterized by greater basal area, canopy cover, and number of trees
   >10 m tall when compared to random sites. Most nest trees were located
   in the yards of single-family residences (48.3\%) and in high-use
   recreational areas (28.3\%). Dominant land-use types in nest areas were
   high-density residential areas (65.9\%) and high-use recreational areas
   (22.7\%). Levels of human disturbance at nest sites did not appear to
   influence nest-site selection. Density of Cooper's hawks nests in Tucson
   was higher thrill in exurban areas and probably was associated with the
   large trees, water, and abundance of prey in the city. Maintaining nest
   sites for Cooper's hawks in Tucson will require maintaining groves of
   large trees.},

Title = {Factors affecting hedgehog (<i>Erinaceus europaeus</i>) attraction to
   rural villages in arable landscapes},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {63},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although residential areas are often unfavourable for wildlife, some
   species can take advantage of the available shelter and anthropogenic
   sources of food such as supplementary feeding. The European hedgehog
   (Erinaceus europaeus) is increasingly associated with gardens and
   villages and less so with arable farmland. Suggested drivers for this
   include the following: hedgehogs' attraction to higher food densities,
   including natural prey and anthropogenic sources, a greater range of day
   nest sites and warmer microclimates in rural villages, coupled with
   decreased risk of predation by badgers (Meles meles). We investigated
   the contribution of these drivers by radio-tracking hedgehogs on four
   arable sites, two with badgers present. Seventy-eight hedgehogs were
   tracked, 32 yielding enough data to calculate home range sizes. At the
   home range and landscape scales, gardens and buildings were the highest
   ranked habitats compared with their availability. Woodland and arable
   land were the lowest ranked compared with their availability. Villages
   were the most selected habitat for nesting. When hedgehogs were found
   closer to buildings, their ranges were smaller and we speculate this is
   due to increased food availability in villages. Where badgers were
   present hedgehogs remained closer to cover and their home ranges were on
   average 12.2 ha smaller. On badger-occupied sites, 50\% fewer
   radio-tracking fixes were on arable land. We conclude that resource
   availability coupled with nest site selection and badger presence drives
   hedgehogs' selection of rural villages. We found no effect of ambient
   temperature on habitat use. We recommend focusing conservation efforts
   on maintaining hedgehog populations in rural villages.},

Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Private gardens have an enormous impact on urban biodiversity, making
   individual householder behavior critical to the conservation and
   enhancement of biodiversity in urban areas. Nature connectedness is
   considered to be a prerequisite for proenvironmental behavior, but how
   it manifests in private gardens is largely unexplored. Nature
   connectedness has also been found to be associated with several
   well-being dimensions. The present study investigates the associations
   between nature connectedness, biodiversity of private gardens, and
   mental wellbeing during the Covid-19 lockdown, a stressful period in
   many people's lives. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to
   analyze data from an online survey of private gardeners in two cities,
   one in Germany and one in New Zealand, in May 2020, approximately two
   months after the beginning of the first Covid-19 lockdown. Garden
   characteristics explained a significant amount of variance in depression
   symptoms during the Covid-19 lockdown. In light of rising pressures on
   urban green spaces, the findings point to the importance of private
   garden qualities for mental health and well-being. Nature connectedness
   emerged as a significant predictor of feature richness, a measure of the
   heterogeneity of habitats that support wildlife, and plant growth form
   richness in people's gardens in both city samples. Nature connectedness
   was also a significant predictor of the extent to which people
   experienced positive emotions during the Covid-19 lockdown but not
   negative emotions and depression symptoms. Our results suggest that
   nature connectedness can provide benefits for both the environment and
   people through its positive association with private garden biodiversity
   and positive emotions.},

Abstract = {Indigenous belief systems and informal institutions that result in the

   conservation. The erosion of cultural beliefs and practices can have
   adverse, often severe, consequences for biodiversity. We explored the
   relationships among informal institutions, religion, and human attitudes
   toward sacred populations of a threatened, endemic species, Sclater's
   monkey (Cercopithecus sclateri), in two communities in southeastern
   Nigeria. Due to habitat loss and hunting pressure across the species'
   range, monkeys in these two sites live alongside people, raid farms and
   gardens, and are commonly viewed as pests. Using structured (n = 410)
   and semi-structured (n = 21) interviews, we examined factors influencing
   residents' views of the monkeys, mechanisms affecting adherence to
   social taboos against harming monkeys, and implications for
   conservation. Our analyses revealed that most residents, particularly
   those from one community, women, and farmers, held negative opinions of
   the monkeys. Crop and garden raiding by monkeys had the most adverse
   effect on people's attitudes. Although the adoption of Christianity
   weakened residents' views regarding the no-killing taboos, continued
   adherence to the taboos was particularly influenced by supernatural
   retribution in one site and community disapproval in the other. Only one
   community widely conferred symbolic importance on the monkeys. Such site
   differences illustrate the value of local cultural understanding in
   conservation. Pre-intervention studies of this nature allow for the
   development of locally and culturally sensitive conservation programs,
   as well as better-informed assessments of what interventions are most

Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {81},
Number = {2},
Pages = {361-365},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Supplementary feeding of wild birds during winter is one of the most
   popular wildlife management activities, and is likely to have profound
   influence on the behavioural ecology of a species. At garden bird
   feeders, birds are now often fed well into the breeding season.
   Providing food within an established songbird territory, however, is
   likely to influence the territorial behaviour of the resident male. We
   used song performance during the dawn chorus in early spring to study
   behavioural changes in food-supplemented great tits, Parus major. After
   2 weeks of continuous food supply within their territory, supplemented
   males started dawn singing later than control males, and thus postponed
   their regular dawn chorus before sunrise. This effect was maintained 2
   weeks after food supplementation had ended. However, we did not find an
   effect of long-term feeding on song output. Our results were largely
   unexpected because formal models and field studies on short-term food
   supplementation suggested an earlier start of dawn singing or a higher
   dawn song output. Because we did not observe great tits visiting the
   feeders before sunrise or food supplementation increasing the numbers of
   conspecific intruders, the reasons for the delay in the start of dawn
   singing remain unclear; possible explanations include the presence of
   predators at feeding stations and the quality of the supplementary food
   itself. Delaying dawn singing could potentially affect the reproductive
   success of supplemented males, for example if females base extrapair
   mating decisions on dawn song performance of their mates. (C) 2010 The

Title = {To kill or not to kill? Exploring normative beliefs and attitudes toward
   snakes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {290},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Whether or not people believe killing snakes is morally acceptable
   affects the likelihood of harming them. An alternative is translocation,
   wherein snakes are relocated to nearby habitat. In our study based in
   semi-arid Phoenix, Arizona (USA), we examine residents' normative
   beliefs about killing snakes across different situations. Analyzing data
   from two survey samples-one of clients who paid for translocation and
   another of residents broadly, we assess if clients exhibit greater
   opposition to killing snakes and more positive attitudes toward them
   compared to the sample of residents, potentially indicating that
   translocation decisions might be intended as acts of conservation.
   Lastly, we address: to what extent do varied attitudes toward snakes,
   experiences with snakes, and socio-demographics influence people's
   beliefs about killing snakes overall and across distinct contexts: on
   private property and in residential homes or yards, as well as anytime,
   in desert habitat, and if someone is bitten? Our analyses demonstrate
   that residents substantially oppose killing snakes, although normative
   beliefs vary by context. Additionally, the client sample was more
   opposed to killing snakes and expressed more positive attitudes than
   residents broadly. Although disgust and other attitudes explain norms
   generally, different attitudes and socio-demographics affect norms
   depending on the context. Finally, although more frequent experiences
   with snakes did not impact norms in our analyses, experiences with
   snakes did increase positive attitudes toward them. Based on our
   findings, we recommend experiential learning to enhance appreciation of
   snakes and call for more research on the outcomes of translocations to
   ensure these decisions aid snake conservation.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {104},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Very little little is known about how lizards respond to urbanization.
   Given their small space requirements, opportunist lizard species can
   potentially exist in small patches of suitable urban habitat. This study
   identified the relative importance of landscape and habitat-level
   factors that influenced the occurrence of an opportunist and generally
   abundant species, the common skink Oligosoma nigriplantare polychrome in
   suburban private gardens in New Zealand. Private gardens are potentially
   important in sustaining urban wildlife as they make up a significant
   proportion of the total area of many cities. Common skinks were largely
   absent from the central suburbs and distributed in less highly ordered
   gardens around the city edge. Skink occurrence was influenced mainly by
   landscape-level features that reflect opportunities for dispersal into
   gardens from source populations (distance to city edge; presence of an
   adjacent grassy paddock) and habitat quality (messiness). To a lesser
   extent skink occurrence was associated with lower cat densities, less
   native vegetation and south-facing sites. Within private gardens common
   skinks were associated with areas with a high proportion of basking
   surfaces, lower plant species diversity, shorter distances to potential
   cover, and vegetation that was low in height and made up mainly of long
   exotic grasses. Despite common skinks' ability to thrive in exotic
   vegetation and their small spatial requirements, it is unlikely that
   they will thrive in urban areas unless gardening practices change to
   increase resource availability and provide refuges from predators. (C)

Title = {Does Historical Coexistence with Dingoes Explain Current Avoidance of
   Domestic Dogs? Island Bandicoots Are Naive to Dogs, unlike Their
   Mainland Counterparts},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {Introduced predators have a global reputation for causing declines and
   extinctions of native species. Native prey naivete towards novel
   predators is thought to be a key reason for predator impacts. However,
   naivete is not necessarily forever: where coexistence establishes, it is
   likely that naivete will be reduced through adaptation, and the once
   alien predator will eventually become recognised by prey. For example,
   native marsupial bandicoots in Sydney avoid backyards with domestic dogs
   (C. lupus familiaris), but not domestic cats (Felis catus), even though
   cats and dogs were both introduced about 200 years ago (Carthey and
   Banks 2012). The authors attributed bandicoots' recognition of dogs to
   long-term exposure to a close relative of dogs, dingoes that arrived in
   Australia 4000 years ago. Here, we test a prediction of this hypothesis
   by taking the study to Tasmania, where dingoes have never been present
   but where domestic dogs also arrived about 200 years ago. We use a
   similar survey design to that of Carthey and Banks (2012): asking Hobart
   residents to report on pet-ownership, bandicoot sightings and scats
   within their backyards, as well as an array of yard characteristic
   control variables. We predicted that if long term experience with
   dingoes enabled mainland bandicoots to recognise domestic dogs, then
   Tasmanian bandicoots, which are inexperienced with dingoes, would not
   recognise domestic dogs. Our results indicate that Tasmanian bandicoots
   are naive to both dogs and cats after only 200 years of coexistence,
   supporting our hypothesis and the notion that naivete in native prey
   towards alien predators (as observed on the mainland) may eventually be
   overcome.},

   Creation of butterfly habitats through landscaping and introduction of

   the major activities undertaken. There was tremendous increase in the
   butterfly population with 4509 sightings of butterflies belonging to 43
   species after 15 months and 10,502 sightings of butterflies belonging to
   56 species after 30 months. These included eight species that are
   endemic to the Western Ghats and ten species having protected status
   under the Indian Wildlife Act. Investigations on the relationship
   between the occurrence of different butterflies and the weather
   conditions revealed that an average temperature ranging between 25 and
   26 degrees C was most favourable for many butterflies followed by 23 and
   25 degrees C as well as 27 and 29 degrees C. Similarly, atmospheric
   humidity ranging between 80 and 100\% was the most preferred range
   followed by 60 and 80\%. With regard to daily rainfall, 50 mm was the
   most favourable followed by 50-100 mm rainfall. Heavy rainfall was found
   to be unfavourable since few butterflies were observed above 100 mm of
   daily rainfall. By regulating humidity and temperature, it was possible
   to manipulate local populations of butterflies, particularly danaid
   butterflies. More or less continuous population was noticed for some
   Danaidae, Lycaenidae, Papilionidae and Pieridae, which also developed
   resident populations in the study area. Strategies were also
   standardized for setting up butterfly gardens.},

Abstract = {As urbanization increases, the identification of nest predators becomes
   important for avian conservation and management of urban wildlife
   communities. We investigated bird nest predation using artificial nests
   in urban areas of the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province of South Africa. From
   June 2013 through February 2014 we installed seventy-five artificial
   nests in 25 suburban gardens in the Ethekwini and Msunduzi
   municipalities of KZN. Euplectes spp. nests were used and baited with
   two quail-sized, hand-made, silicon eggs. These were placed in
   residential gardens and monitored by camera traps for 2-weeks in winter,
   spring and summer respectively. Generally bird nesting occurs throughout
   the year in KZN's subtropical climate, with some avoidance during the
   autumn season. Therefore, experiments were not conducted during autumn,
   as fresh nests were not available for use. Overall the rate of predation
   on artificial nests was 25 \% (n = 19), with vervet monkeys Ceropithecus
   aethiops pygerythrus predating 20 \% (n = 17) of the nests while
   domestic cats Felis catus predated 3 \% (n = 2) of nests. Nest predation
   was significantly higher in the winter season, with 79 \% of
   depredations occurring in winter (n = 15), 16 \% in spring (n = 3) and 5
   \% in summer (n = 1), and in areas with less canopy cover. Our results
   suggest that vervet monkeys may have a negative impact on nesting birds
   in urban environments, however, in order to assess the rate of predation
   experiments on natural nests coupled with information on fledgling
   success is deemed necessary to investigate avian population declines.},

   and spatial characteristics. A questionnaire asked for information on
   motives for planting and removing trees in general, and on actual
   planting and removal of trees in the last five years. Responses to
   questions about motives, to other questions on the values and problems
   of trees, and to a photo-elicitation section were numerically classified
   to derive seven classes of residents: aesthetes; spiritual tree lovers;
   practical tree lovers; arboriphobes: native wildlife lovers; tree hazard
   minimisers; and indifferents. Membership of classes was influenced by
   income, tertiary education and gender, but not age, negative experiences

   relatively durable and not easily amenable to change. Attitudes tended
   to be expressed in actions. Variation between attitude groups in the
   types of trees they prefer combined with turnover of property ownership
   may be responsible for a lack of old urban trees. Urban planners and

Title = {The domestic garden - Its contribution to urban green infrastructure},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {129-137},
Abstract = {Domestic gardens provide a significant component of urban green
   infrastructure but their relative contribution to eco-system service
   provision remains largely un-quantified. `Green infrastructure' itself
   is often ill-defined, posing problems for planners to ascertain what
   types of green infrastructure provide greatest benefit and under what
   circumstances. Within this context the relative merits of gardens are
   unclear; however, at a time of greater urbanization where private
   gardens are increasingly seen as a `luxury', it is important to define
   their role precisely. Hence, the nature of this review is to interpret
   existing information pertaining to gardens/gardening per se, identify
   where they may have a unique role to play and to highlight where further
   research is warranted. The review suggests that there are significant
   differences in both form and management of domestic gardens which
   radically influence the benefits. Nevertheless, gardens can play a
   strong role in improving the environmental impact of the domestic
   curtilage, e.g. by insulating houses against temperature extremes they
   can reduce domestic energy use. Gardens also improve localized air
   cooling, help mitigate flooding and provide a haven for wildlife. Less
   favourable aspects include contributions of gardens and gardening to
   greenhouse gas emissions, misuse of fertilizers and pesticides, and
   introduction of alien plant species. Due to the close proximity to the
   home and hence accessibility for many, possibly the greatest benefit of
   the domestic garden is on human health and well-being, but further work
   is required to define this clearly within the wider context of green
   infrastructure. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Lawn Removal Motivation, Satisfaction, and Landscape Maintenance
   Practices of Southern Californians},

Abstract = {Conserving water in California landscapes is critical due to a limited
   water supply, recurring droughts, and the energy use and costs of
   transporting water from northern to southern California due to a water
   distribution and population imbalance. Metropolitan Water District of
   Southern California (MWD, Los Angeles, CA) spent more than \$310 million
   between 2014 and 2016 on lawn removal rebates in an effort to conserve
   residential water. In some cases, cities and local water districts
   augmented MWD rebates with their own incentives. We conducted a
   web-based study of 1153 southern Californians who removed all or a
   portion of their lawns over the past 10 years to identify their
   motivation, satisfaction, landscape water use, and related maintenance
   practices. Results indicate that rebates were less important for most
   respondents than the desire to conserve water, improve landscape
   appearance, and reduce costs. There was a high correlation between the
   overall satisfaction with the lawn replacement process and the
   appearance of transformed landscapes, supporting earlier findings
   regarding the importance consumers place on landscape appearance.
   Results of this study are timely for providing guidance to policymakers
   and water districts regarding the cost-effectiveness of lawn removal
   rebates to conserve urban water. This study also highlights a need and
   opportunity for water districts and Cooperative Extension to provide
   irrigation training to residents of stand-alone homes who maintain their
   own landscapes. While 90\% of respondents indicated they singly (78\%)
   or jointly (12\%) determine irrigation schedules rather than rely on a
   gardener or landscaper, only 18\% indicated they base irrigation
   schedules on soil moisture content or soil texture (6\%). There is also
   a need to provide education to water districts that incentivize the use
   of synthetic turf in hot inland and desert areas regarding potential
   high-temperature injury to humans, pets, and wildlife.},

Abstract = {Urban areas provide small carnivores with an abundance of resources and
   reduced predation risk, resulting in higher population densities. Urban
   animals tend to have greatly reduced home range sizes in response to
   increased resource availability. We investigated the home range size of
   yellow mongoosesCynictis penicillatain an urban area and determined
   whether their home ranges overlapped with human residential areas. We
   studied the home range sizes of 8 collared and GPS tracked individuals
   in the Meyersdal Nature Area in South Africa; an area divided into two
   residential wildlife estates (4 individuals per estate): an Eco-Estate
   that was a built up residential area interspersed with natural areas;
   and a Nature Estate with reduced contact between animals and human
   residential areas. We used three methods to calculate home range size,
   namely Minimum Convex Polygon, Kernel Density Estimates and Local Convex
   Hull. Home range size was slightly larger in the Nature Estate, and male
   home ranges were larger than those of females. Compared to previous
   studies, home range sizes were considerably smaller in our study.
   Seasonal variation in home range could not be statistically compared,
   but, similar to non-urban populations, we observed smaller home range
   sizes during the breeding season (winter and spring) and larger sizes
   during the non-breeding season (autumn and summer). The overlap of home
   ranges with residential areas, and the record of multiple GPS fixes of
   tracked individuals within human residential gardens, was evident in
   both estates but to a greater extent in the Eco-Estate. Seasonal overlap
   with residential areas was greatest during autumn and winter. We showed
   that yellow mongooses modify their home ranges in response to
   urbanisation, which might be a consequence of abundant and easily
   accessible available resources, particularly during colder periods.},

Abstract = {Introduction. Protected areas represent a huge reservoir of biological
   resources which local residents are highly dependent on. The
   non-inclusion of local knowledge is often an obstacle to conservation
   policy and sustainable use of biodiversity in these areas. The Reserve
   of Pama, located in the South-sudanian zone of Burkina Faso, is a good
   example of the discrepancy between the subsistence needs of local
   populations and the need to conserve biodiversity. Assessing the
   socio-economic importance of this reserve for local residents could lead
   to adapting a better strategy of natural resource management. Materials
   and methods. Ethnobotanical surveys were conducted based on interviews.
   The information obtained from the interrogation of 30 resource people
   identified the different uses made of the reserve by local people and
   the impact of these uses on the flora, and assessed the perception of
   villagers on the way of managing their forest resources. Results. A
   total of 58 plant species in the reserve, over 15\% of the local flora,
   provide various resources to local populations, including construction
   equipment (90\% response), medicinal plants (73.33\%), food plants
   (73.33\%), etc. The plant species most in demand were found to be, among
   others, Vitellaria paradoxa (80\%). Parkia biglobosa (66.67\%),
   Diospyros mespiliformis (33.33\%), Gardenia erubescens (33.33\%), Lannea
   microcarpa (33.33\%). Tamarindus indica (33.33\%), Anchypogon gayanus
   (26.67\%) and A. cbinensis (26.67\%). Some of these species have proved
   increasingly rare due to the deterioration of climatic conditions, abuse
   of green wood and soil depletion. Conclusion. The study we conducted on
   the reserve of Pama leads us to advocate stronger measures to protect
   the environment through the involvement of local residents. Moreover,
   the field planting of useful species in the process of depletion would
   be able to limit the operating pressure on the reserve.},

Title = {Citizen science reveals widespread supplementary feeding of African
   woolly-necked storks in suburban areas of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {African woolly-necked storks (Ciconia microscelis) depend on wetland
   habitats for foraging and nesting in natural environments. Recently,
   they have started colonising urban environments in KwaZulu-Natal, South
   Africa, and are now a common sight in suburban areas in particular.
   There have been some anecdotal reports on supplementary feeding of this
   species by households in some urban areas where they are common.
   However, these reports have never been confirmed and therefore the
   extent of feeding and lack thereof is unknown. Using a questionnaire
   survey, we therefore investigated the extent (if any) to which
   householders in urban and suburban areas of KwaZulu-Natal provide
   supplementary food to African woolly-necked storks. We also determined
   the feeders' provisioning habits, and identified the motivation behind
   and attitudes toward feeding. We found that a significant number of
   householders fed African woolly-necked storks on a daily basis
   throughout the year. The majority of respondents provided meat while
   others provided inappropriate food such as bread. Respondents were most
   often motivated to feed for personal pleasure. Our results showed that
   this species is successfully utilising and exploiting anthropogenic food
   - a novel behaviour. The observations and narratives from respondents
   strongly suggest that the African woolly-necked stork is present
   throughout the year, contrary to the perception that this species is
   migratory during winter. Based on the results obtained in this study,
   supplementary feeding of African woolly-necked stork by householders is
   relatively common, widespread and established in suburban areas of
   KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. However, reported inappropriate feeding may
   create concerns regarding the health status of African woolly-necked
   storks in urban population. Therefore, to prevent further detrimental
   effects and potential human-wildlife conflicts we recommend that
   suitable feeding guidelines be formulated.},

Title = {What makes a house a home? Nest box use by West European hedgehogs
   (<i>Erinaceus europaeus</i>) is influenced by nest box placement,
   resource provisioning and site-based factors},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Artificial refuges provided by householders and/or conservation
   practitioners potentially represent one mechanism for mitigating
   declines in the availability of natural nest sites used for resting,
   breeding and hibernating in urban areas. The effectiveness of such
   refuges for different species is, however, not always known. In this
   study, we conducted a questionnaire survey of UK householders to
   identify factors associated with the use of ground-level nest boxes for
   West European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), a species of conservation
   concern. Overall, the percentage of boxes used at least once varied with
   season and type of use: summer day nesting (35.5-81.3\%), breeding (7.2-
   28.2\%), winter day nesting (20.1-66.5\%) and hibernation (21.7-58.6\%).
   The length of time the box had been deployed, the availability of
   artificial food and front garden to back garden access significantly
   increased the likelihood that a nest box had been used for all four
   nesting types, whereas other factors related to placement within the
   garden (e.g., in a sheltered location, on hardstanding such as paving,
   distance from the house) and resource provisioning (bedding) affected
   only some nesting behaviours. The factors most strongly associated with
   nest box use were the provisioning of food and bedding. These data
   suggest, therefore, that householders can adopt simple practices to
   increase the likelihood of their nest box being used. However, one
   significant limitation evident within these data is that, for welfare
   reasons, householders do not routinely monitor whether their box has
   been used. Consequently, future studies need to adopt strategies which
   enable householders to monitor their boxes continuously. Ultimately,
   such studies should compare the survival rates and reproductive success
   of hedgehogs within artificial refuges versus more natural nest sites,
   and whether these are affected by, for example, the impact of nest box
   design and placement on predation risk and internal microclimate.},

Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {122},
Number = {5},
Pages = {682-694},

Abstract = {Although urban areas are often considered to have uniformly negative
   effects on biodiversity, cities are most accurately characterized as
   heterogeneous mosaics of buildings, streets, parks, and gardens that
   include both good' and bad' areas for wildlife. However, to date, few
   studies have evaluated how human impacts vary in direction and magnitude
   across a heterogeneous urban landscape. In this study, we assessed the
   distribution of floral resources and flower-visiting insects across a
   variety of land uses in New York City. We visited both green spaces
   (e.g. parks, cemeteries) and heavily developed neighborhood blocks (e.g.
   with high or low density residential zoning) and used structural
   equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of
   median income, vegetation, and development intensity on floral resources
   and insects in both settings. Abundance and taxonomic richness of
   flower-visiting insects was significantly greater in green spaces than
   neighborhood blocks. The SEM results indicated that heavily-developed
   neighborhoods generally had fewer flower-visiting insects consistent
   with reductions in floral resources. However, some low-density
   residential neighborhoods maintained high levels of floral resources and
   flower-visiting insects. We found that the effects of surrounding
   vegetation on floral resources, and thus indirect effects on insects,
   varied considerably between green spaces and neighborhood blocks. Along
   neighborhood blocks, vegetation consisted of a mosaic of open gardens
   and sparsely distributed trees and had a positive indirect effect on
   flower-visiting insects. In contrast, vegetation in urban green spaces
   was associated with increased canopy cover and thus had a negative
   indirect effect on flower-visiting insects through reductions in floral
   resources. In both neighborhood blocks and green spaces, vegetation had
   a positive direct effect on flower-visiting insects independent of the
   influence of vegetation on floral resources. Our results demonstrate how
   inter-related components of an urban ecosystem can vary with respect to
   one another across a heterogeneous urban landscape, suggesting that it
   is inappropriate to generalize about urban systems as a whole without
   first addressing differences among component land use types.},

Abstract = {How are our cities using nature-based solutions to confront the
   challenges posed by a warming climate, the loss of biodiversity and
   major resource depletion? This article discusses the opportunities and
   benefits of applying the concepts of regreening and rewilding of cities.
   The article engages with key sources and summarizes the background and
   development of regreening and nature-based solutions and important
   policies, concerns and perspectives of international and national
   organizations. It introduces the integration of nature-based solutions
   (NBS) as a strategy in urban planning with the aim to strengthen urban
   resilience and to slow down the biodiversity decline. Rewilding areas in
   cities has become a powerful strategy to bring back butterflies,
   insects, birds, and wildlife. In contrast to highly managed parks and
   gardens, these rewilding initiatives are leaving allotted spaces mostly
   uncultivated and self-regulated. Contact to nature is essential for
   human existence, urban wellbeing, and good quality of life. Green spaces
   in cities-big or small-all contribute to the health and wellbeing of
   residents. However, many cities do not offer residents easy access to
   green space within the city. Improving the better distribution of and
   access to green spaces and extending gardens and parks is likely to
   deliver a large number of benefits, such as: ecosystem services, better
   water management for enhanced urban flood control, slowing down the
   biodiversity loss, contributing to food security, and restoring damaged
   ecosystems. Furthermore, additional green space and NBS help to keep
   cities cool during heatwaves and improve the urban microclimate.
   Rewilding has emerged as an important part of new public parks and
   gardens. The next step is to up-scale citywide climate intervention
   strategies deployed to keep cities cool. However, as the discussion of
   this article shows, it is essential that the design of these NBS
   strategies is fully integrated with other complementary planning
   interventions and seeks synergies across all sectors.},

Abstract = {Feeding wild bird is popular in domestic gardens across the world, with
   around half of households in the UK, North America and Australia doing
   so. Nevertheless, there is surprisingly little empirical information on
   many aspects of the activity. We sought to characterise garden bird
   feeding in a large UK urban area in two ways. First, we conducted
   face-to-face questionnaires with a representative cross-section of
   residents. Just over half fed birds, the majority doing so year-round
   and at least weekly. Second, a 2-year, longitudinal study recorded all
   foodstuffs put out by households on every provisioning occasion. In this
   way, we obtained the first year-round quantitative records of the
   amounts and types of wild bird food provided in individual gardens. A
   median of 127 g, equivalent to 628 kcal, was given daily per household
   (typically consisting of several food types). We estimated the daily
   cost of this provisioning level to be UK 0.35 pound per household based
   on the relative proportions of each food type. Provisioning level was
   not significantly influenced by weather or season. Comparisons between
   the data sets revealed significantly less frequent feeding amongst the
   feeders in the longitudinal study (assumed to be `keen' feeders owing to
   their participation in this long-term study and numbers of food types
   provided) than the face-to-face questionnaire respondents, suggesting
   that questionnaires relying upon participants' estimates rather than
   records of provisioning may overestimate actual provisioning frequency.
   Assuming 100\% uptake, the median provisioning level equates to
   sufficient supplementary resources across the UK to fully support 196
   million individuals of a hypothetical average garden-feeding bird
   species (based on 10 common UK garden-feeding birds' energy
   requirements). This compares with an estimated total of 71 million
   breeding individuals of these 10 species in the UK (non-breeding numbers
   unknown). Taking the lowest provisioning level recorded (101 kcal/day)
   as a conservative measure, 31 million of these average individuals could
   theoretically be supported.},

   Policy Setting for Urban Greening in Perth, Western Australia},
Journal = {URBAN SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are regarded as
   the key policy agenda for national, regional, and local government to
   combat climate change impacts and promote sustainable development. For
   example, in Perth and Peel metropolitan area, the capital city of
   Western Australia, there has been a shift of policy setting from that of
   a sprawling city to a denser city, while maintaining and promoting its
   ecosystem services and achieving sustainable city goals. Residential
   verge gardens have been widely adopted in recent years by communities
   and local governments in the Perth metropolitan area. This study reviews
   the motivations and drivers for the uptake of verge gardens in
   metropolitan suburbs and identifies potential policy responses. The City
   of Bayswater local government area was surveyed for this research. The
   study considers a mixed-methods approach, including site auditing and a
   questionnaire survey for local residents who have transformed their
   verges. A total of 534 verge gardens were audited on residential lots,
   and 166 valid questionnaire responses were received from residents. The
   site-audit of the verge gardens in Bayswater found that native
   vegetation is the dominant verge garden of choice, followed by the
   ornamental garden, with food production (plants/vegetables) seeming to
   be the least popular option. Regarding the motivations and drivers, the
   study has found that social (e.g., aesthetics, flowers, social
   interactions, and social mimicry), environmental (e.g., attracting
   wildlife and birds and environmental practice waterwise garden), and
   personal (easy maintenance) drivers are the primary motivators for
   residents to adopt verge gardens. Whilst the on-ground surveys were
   prior to COVID-19, the article includes how this topic could relate to
   pandemic-resilient urban spaces. As local governments look towards
   supporting the sustainable outcome goals, the observations of this study
   will be helpful for developing local government policy and community
   programs in the promotion and uptake of verge gardens in Australian
   cities.},

Title = {Site selection by geese in a suburban landscape},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {Background. In European and North American cities geese are among the
   most common and most visible large herbivores. As such, their presence
   and behaviour often conflict with the desires of the human residents.
   Fouling, noise, aggression and health concerns are all cited as reasons
   that there are ``too many{''}. Lethal control is often used for
   population management; however, this raises questions about whether this
   is a sustainable strategy to resolve the conflict between humans and
   geese when, paradoxically, it is humans that are responsible for
   creating the habitat and often providing the food and protection of
   geese at other times. We hypothesise that the landscaping of suburban
   parks can be improved to decrease its attractiveness to geese and to
   reduce the opportunity for conflict between geese and humans.
   Methods. Using observations collected over five years from a botanic
   garden situated in suburban Belgium and data from the whole of Flanders
   in Belgium, we examined landscape features that attract geese. These
   included the presence of islands in lakes, the distance from water,
   barriers to level flight and the size of exploited areas. The birds
   studied were the tadornine goose Alopochen aegyptiaca (L. 1766)
   (Egyptian goose) and the anserine geese, Branta canadensis (L. 1758)
   (Canada goose), Anser anser (L. 1758) (greylag goose) and Branta
   leucopsis (Bechstein, 1803) (barnacle goose). Landscape modification is
   a known method for altering goose behaviour, but there is little
   information on the power of such methods with which to inform managers
   and planners.
   Results. Our results demonstrate that lakes with islands attract more
   than twice as many anserine geese than lakes without islands, but make
   little difference to Egyptian geese. Furthermore, flight barriers
   between grazing areas and lakes are an effective deterrent to geese
   using an area for feeding. Keeping grazing areas small and surrounded by
   trees reduces their attractiveness to geese.
   Conclusion. The results suggest that landscape design can be used
   successfully to reduce the number of geese and their conflict with
   humans. However, this approach has its limitations and would require
   humans to compromise on what they expect from their landscaped parks,
   such as open vistas, lakes, islands and closely cropped lawns.},

Title = {Moles and Mole Control on British Farms, Amenities and Gardens after
   Strychnine Withdrawal},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary: Moles are burrowing mammals that are regarded as pests
   in Britain, and until 2006 they could legally be killed using strychnine
   poison. When strychnine was withdrawn there were fears that mole
   populations would increase. We surveyed farmers, amenity managers and
   householders about moles and mole control on their land in 2007, post
   strychnine withdrawal. Kill-trapping was by far the preferred control
   method used and control may be used more than can be justified by damage
   levels or the effect of control on damage. Mole traps are unregulated,
   unlike most other spring traps, and some might not meet current welfare
   standards. We found no evidence that mole activity had increased since a
   1992 survey of farms.
   Abstract: Moles are considered pests in Britain, but this issue has been
   little studied. Lower welfare standards have been tolerated for moles
   than for most other managed wild mammal species, as use of both the
   controversial poison, strychnine, and unregulated traps have been
   permitted. Strychnine was withdrawn in 2006 and there were fears that
   mole populations would increase as a result. In 2007, we conducted a
   comprehensive, nationwide survey of land manager perceptions, opinions
   and behaviour regarding moles and mole control on farms, amenities and
   domestic gardens in Britain. We surveyed 2150 land managers (achieving a
   59\% response rate) and ground-truthed 29 responses. Moles were reported
   to be present on most farms and amenities, and 13\% of gardens, and were
   more common in lighter soils. Where present, moles were usually
   considered pests, this being more likely in Wales, Scotland and northern
   England, on livestock and mixed farms, and on large, high-value
   amenities, e.g., racecourses and golf courses. Mole control followed
   similar patterns to mole presence. More control may occur than is
   economically, and therefore potentially ethically, justified. Control
   should be more carefully considered and, where necessary, more
   effectively targeted. Kill-trapping was the favoured recent and future
   method on farms and amenities, even if strychnine was to be
   reintroduced; however, because mole traps are currently unregulated,
   some might not meet current welfare standards if tested. We found no
   evidence for an increase in moles since a farm questionnaire survey
   conducted in 1992; this could have wider implications for future
   wildlife management policy changes.},

Title = {A taxonomically detailed and large-scale view of the factors affecting
   the distribution and abundance of tree species planted in private
   gardens of Christchurch city, New Zealand},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {A city's planted trees, the great majority of which are in private
   gardens, play a fundamental role in shaping a city's wild ecology,
   ecosystem functioning, and ecosystem services. However, studying tree
   diversity across a city's many thousands of separate private gardens is
   logistically challenging. After the disastrous 2010-2011 earthquakes in
   Christchurch, New Zealand, over 7,000 homes were abandoned and a
   botanical survey of these gardens was contracted by the Government's
   Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) prior to buildings being
   demolished. This unprecedented access to private gardens across the
   443.9 hectares `Residential Red Zone' area of eastern Christchurch is a
   unique opportunity to explore the composition of trees in private
   gardens across a large area of a New Zealand city. We analysed these
   survey data to describe the effects of housing age, socio-economics,
   human population density, and general soil quality, on tree abundance,
   species richness, and the proportion of indigenous and exotic species.
   We found that while most of the tree species were exotic, about half of
   the individual trees were local native species. There is an increasing
   realisation of the native tree species values among Christchurch
   citizens and gardens in more recent areas of housing had a higher
   proportion of smaller/younger native trees. However, the same sites had
   proportionately more exotic trees, by species and individuals, amongst
   their larger planted trees than older areas of housing. The majority of
   the species, and individuals, of the larger (>= 10 cm DBH) trees planted
   in gardens still tend to be exotic species. In newer suburbs, gardens in
   wealthy areas had more native trees than gardens from poorer areas,
   while in older suburbs, poorer areas had more native big trees than
   wealthy areas. In combination, these describe, in detail unparalleled
   for at least in New Zealand, how the tree infrastructure of the city
   varies in space and time. This lays the groundwork for better
   understanding of how wildlife distribution and abundance, wild plant
   regeneration, and ecosystem services, are affected by the city's trees.},

Title = {Citizen Science Helps Uncover the Secrets to a Bat-Friendly Swimming
   Pool in an Urban Environment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {For urban environments to support bat communities, resources need to be
   readily available. For example, bats typically use urban water sources
   such as drainage ditches and ponds; however, these sources can be
   ephemeral. During these periods, bats have utilized residential swimming
   pools, although they only appear to drink at pools when access to more
   natural equivalents are limited. This posed the question ``can we make
   residential swimming pools friendlier for a diversity of bat
   species?{''} Using citizen science to determine which pool
   characteristics influenced bat activity, we distributed a questionnaire
   to residents in a suburban neighborhood in Fort Worth, TX, United
   States. It focused on observations of bat activity and the features of
   the pools and immediate surroundings. We distributed the questionnaire
   through social media, local presentations, and by mail throughout 2019
   and 2020. We then used classification trees to determine which
   characteristics in combination influenced bat activity at the pools. We
   generated three different trees for bats observed (1) flying around the
   property and backyard, (2) above the swimming pool, and (3) drinking at
   the pool. We found that more bats were observed at unlit pools without
   bush or shrub borders. Furthermore, among pools with borders, activity
   was lowest at pools with textured interiors and >= 6 trees visible. The
   presence of features, such as fountains, then contributed to a reduction
   in bat observations in backyards and the presence of pets appeared to
   further reduce activity specifically over the pools. Where bats were
   observed drinking, this activity was reported the least at pools with
   bush or shrub borders, textured interiors, and trees 10 m from the edge
   of the pools. Our study revealed that certain characteristics of
   residential swimming pools encouraged bat activity, while others
   discouraged them. Thus, it may be possible to make swimming pools more
   bat-friendly. For example, turning lights off in the evening when
   backyards are not in use and reducing clutter around pools could have an
   immediate positive impact on local bat populations. The implementation
   of such recommendations could improve urban habitats for bats overall
   and alleviate some of the negative implications of continued
   urbanization.},

Title = {Boundaries in ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and environmental
   variables at the edges of forest patches with residential developments},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Background. Few studies of edge effects on wildlife objectively identify
   habitat edges or explore non-linear responses. In this paper, we build
   on ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) research that has begun to
   address these domains by using triangulation wombling to identify
   boundaries in beetle community structure and composition at the edges of
   forest patches with residential developments. We hypothesized that edges
   are characterized by boundaries in environmental variables that
   correspond to marked discontinuities in vegetation structure between
   maintained yards and forest. We expected environmental boundaries to be
   associated with beetle boundaries.
   Methods. We collected beetles and measured environmental variables in
   200 m by 200 m sampling grids centered at the edges of three forest
   patches, each with a rural, suburban, or urban context, in Charlotte,
   North Carolina, USA. We identified boundaries within each grid at two
   spatial scales and tested their significance and overlap using boundary
   statistics and overlap statistics, respectively. We complemented
   boundary delineation with k-means clustering.
   Results. Boundaries in environmental variables, such as temperature,
   grass cover, and leaf litter depth, occurred at or near the edges of all
   three sites, in many cases at both scales. The beetle variables that
   exhibited the most pronounced boundary structure in relation to edges
   were total species evenness, generalist abundance, generalist richness,
   generalist evenness, and Agonum punctiforme abundance. Environmental and
   beetle boundaries also occurred within forest patches and residential
   developments, indicating substantial localized spatial variation on
   either side of edges. Boundaries in beetle and environmental variables
   that displayed boundary structure at edges significantly overlapped, as
   did boundaries on either side of edges. The comparison of boundaries and
   clusters revealed that boundaries formed parts of the borders of patches
   of similar beetle or environmental condition.
   Discussion. We show that edge effects on ground beetle community
   structure and composition and environmental variation at the
   intersection of forest patches and residential developments can be
   described by boundaries and that these boundaries overlap in space.
   However, our results also highlight the complexity of edge effects in
   our system: environmental boundaries were located at or near edges
   whereas beetle boundaries related to edges could be spatially disjunct
   from them; boundaries incompletely delineated edges such that only parts
   of edges were well-described by sharp transitions in beetle and/or
   environmental variables; and the occurrence of boundaries related to
   edges was apparently influenced by individual property management
   practices, site-specific characteristics such as development geometry,
   and spatial scale.},

Abstract = {Lay Summary center dot Supplemental feeding of avian species has been
   linked to beneficial, negative and neutral outcomes. Understanding the
   drivers behind these differences are important for understanding human
   impacts on avian populations as well as developing future conservation
   management plans. center dot We tracked a population of Mountain
   Chickadees from two elevations in the Sierra Nevada, USA for nine years
   and compared the breeding performance of pairs that used versus those
   that did not use feeders available throughout the winter. center dot The
   provisioning we provided is likely similar to the passive backyard
   feeding observed by many across the world but was conducted in an
   isolated natural coniferous forest environment. center dot Despite the
   robust long-term dataset and intensive reproductive monitoring, we found
   no significant differences in the reproductive performance of chickadees
   that accessed feeders and those that did not. center dot Our results add
   to the evidence that the effects of passive or targeted supplemental
   feeding are context and species dependent.
   Supplemental feeding of wild animal populations is popular across many
   areas of the world and has long been considered beneficial, especially
   to avian taxa. Over 4 billion dollars are spent by hobby bird feeders in
   the United States each year alone. However, there is mixed evidence
   whether wildlife feeding is beneficial, including when it is implemented
   as a conservation management tool, a targeted experimental design, or an
   avocation. Much of the current evidence suggests that providing
   supplemental food is advantageous to the reproductive output and general
   survival of focal taxa. However, many of these studies are limited in
   scope and duration, leaving possible negative impacts unaddressed. This
   is particularly true regarding passive backyard feeding, which describes
   the majority of supplemental feeding, including the immense effort of
   millions of public enthusiasts. Here we show that winter supplemental
   feeding prior to reproduction had no significant impact on a range of
   reproductive parameters in a resident, montane passerine species, the
   Mountain Chickadee (Poecile gambeli). This population resides in an
   intact natural environment with no exposure to supplemental food beyond
   our experimental treatments, and individual birds were tracked across
   six years using radio frequency identification technology. Our results
   add to the growing evidence that supplemental feeding alone, isolated
   from the effects of urban environments, may have little to no impact on
   the population dynamics of some avian taxa.},

Abstract = {Managing non-native species in cities is often controversial because
   these species can support both ecosystem services and disservices. Yet,
   how the acceptability of non-native species management by the general
   public differs in relation to native species, to distance (i.e. close to
   residence and elsewhere) and among plants and animals is understudied.
   Furthermore, while values, beliefs and knowledge are often considered in
   this context, psychometric factors such as emotions and anthropomorphic
   views have received little attention. We surveyed 658 residents in
   Berlin, Germany, to assess (i) the acceptability of management actions
   differing in their severity for non-native plants and animals compared
   to native species with similar traits, (ii) the influence of perceived
   distance of species (i.e. close to residence and elsewhere) and (iii)
   the predictive potential of psychometric (i.e. values, beliefs,
   self-assessed knowledge, emotions and anthropomorphism) and
   socio-demographic factors for this acceptability. Eradication (i.e.
   lethal control/removal) was generally the least accepted management
   action, but more accepted for non-native than native species. Distance
   mattered for the acceptability of non-native plant management with
   unspecified control action the most accepted management action close to
   residence. While values (self-transcendence and conservation) mostly
   explained the acceptability of doing nothing and eradication, emotions
   related strongly to all management actions. Beliefs were more important
   than self-assessed knowledge in relation to non-native species
   management and beliefs about non-native plants and animals were rated
   almost similar. Anthropomorphic views had predictive potential for
   plants and animals; that is, the stronger people held anthropomorphic
   views, the less they accepted eradication. Participants with a garden
   supported doing nothing with plants (native and non-native) more than
   without. Results highlight the complexity of factors underlying the
   acceptability of management actions on species in cities. While values,
   beliefs and self-assessed knowledge are important in the context of
   species management, other psychometric factors add to our understanding
   of acceptability. We conclude that awareness about different
   acceptability patterns related to species management can support
   environmental policies on biological invasions in cities. Tailoring and
   implementing adequate management actions can benefit from incorporating
   cognitive but also affective factors of the public. Read the free Plain

Abstract = {The purpose of the article is to study the functioning of the Russian
   traditional agro-industrial structure in the landscape and climatic
   conditions of the Northern Trans-Urals during the period from 1700s to
   1830s. Following L.S. Berg, we understand the landscape as ``... regular
   groupings of objects and phenomena on the land surface, on the bottom
   and on the surface of the sea (and in general reservoirs), due to the
   regular repetition of the properties and features of soils and rocky
   soils, rock formations, aquatic environment, relief, vegetation,
   wildlife, human and his material and spiritual culture aspects{''}. The
   sources of the study include economic and geographical descriptions of
   the region left by contemporaries and the office records of local
   government agencies as well.
   Due to the landscape and climatic conditions of the Northern
   Trans-Urals, arable farming in the north of the region did not go beyond
   experiments and it was sporadic in the south. At least the Berezovitsy
   and Surgutyans had vegetable gardens since the second half of the 18th
   century. As time went on, the range of plants expanded, and the truck
   farming advanced to Obdorsk. The hunter was primarily interested in
   fur-bearing animals, whose reserves were largely depleted (especially in
   the cities), but still provided the hunter with acceptable prey sizes.
   Stocks of the other fur-bearing animals, birds, fish and wild plants
   remained at a very high level. Tools, methods and timing of fishing
   activities depended on time of the year, terrain features and behavioral
   attitudes of fur-bearing animals. The fishing activity was complicated
   by the fact that the lands, except for suburban ones, had to be rented
   from the aborigines. Cattle breeding was restrained by the lack of
   hayfields, their quality (hummocks, shrubs) and the relief of floodplain
   spaces - in case of high flood, bottomland meadows went under water for
   a long time. Keeping sheep, pigs, and poultry was complicated by a huge
   number of dogs. Dogs and deer were widely used for trips through the
   taiga and tundra. The structure of handicraft lessons had been
   organically integrated into the landscape. In the 1820s, the Berezov's
   residents engaged in the deer skins manufacturing. In summer river
   transport became the only type of transport in the region. Shipbuilding
   and ship repair work required specialists - carpenters and blacksmiths.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},

Abstract = {Ornamental plants and relevant horticulture practices provide essential
   environmental, economic, social, and aesthetic benefits for human
   wellbeing. However, the contribution of ornamental plants-based
   ecosystem services (ESs) to human wellbeing (HWB) has not yet been
   explored in detail. This study was carried out with the aim of
   contributing to this knowledge gap. Accordingly, the purpose of this
   study is to evaluate the relationship between ornamental plants
   based-ESs and HWB in a home garden context in Lefke Region of North
   Cyprus. The objectives of the study were (i) to identify the ornamental
   plant species cultivated in the home gardens, (ii) to evaluate the major
   ornamental plants-based ESs, (iii) to assess the contributions of the
   relevant ESs to the HWB, and (iv) to examine the interrelationship
   between the different categories of ESs and HWB. The conceptual
   framework of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and a social preference
   valuation approach were adopted to assess the ornamental plants-based
   ESs, their contributions to the components of HWB, and interrelations
   amongst them. A number of qualitative (e.g. semi-structured interviews)
   and quantitative (e.g. a questionnaire) research tools were employed to
   collect the relevant data. The quantitative data obtained from 170
   residents were evaluated using a 0-5 Likert Scale. The field surveys
   revealed that the composition of ornamental plants in the home gardens
   consists of 233 plant species. Evaluation of the quantitative data
   showed that the average relative value of the ornamental plants-based
   ESs varies between the categories of habitat-based ESs (4,08 points) and
   regulating ESs (3,00 points). This finding indicates the significant
   role of ornamental plants for `habitat formation' and `wildlife
   attraction'. The most tagged components were `habitats for pets' and
   `aesthetic quality'. The ornamental plants-based ESs particularly
   contribute to the two components of HWB: `security' (4,51 points) and
   `contact with nature' (4,37 points). The relationship between the ESs
   and HWB was quantified on a 1-5 Likert scale. A high degree of
   correlation was found between the categories of `provisioning services'
   and `basic material for a good life' and also between the categories of
   `cultural services' and `development of good social relations' with a
   4,96 points. The lowest degree of correlation was estimated to be
   between the categories of `regulating services' and `development good
   social relations' with a 1,01 points. The results of this study may
   contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between
   the ornamental plants-based ESs and HWB in Lefke Region and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Background Cuatrocienegas, part of the Chihuahuan Desert, is a region of
   unique biological, geological, geographical, and evolutionary
   importance. Its current population is mestizo; nevertheless, it has high
   national historical, cultural, and touristic relevance in Mexico. It has
   been cataloged as nationally significant for its flora and fauna by
   Mexican law, as well as being designated a High Protection site by the
   World Wildlife Fund and UNESCO. Because of its diverse and complex
   biological and sociocultural characteristics, we considered it important
   to determine, identify, and analyze various aspects of the traditional
   ethnobotanical knowledge and practices in this region. Methods Between
   2016 and 2019, seven field trips were made to document the knowledge and
   use of flora. Cuatrocienegas is a protected area, collecting botanical
   material is regulated, so specimens were photographed and collected in
   neighboring communities, and in public and private gardens. Later
   permission was obtained to complete the collection of specimens
   (2019-2020). The plants were identified and entered into the flora
   database of the state of Coahuila, and deposited in the Herbarium of the
   Faculty of Forest Sciences, Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, Mexico.
   One hundred ten local residents (50 men and 60 women), aged between 27
   and 91 years, were interviewed (semi-structured interviews). The
   cultural importance of ethnobotanical resources (cultural significance
   index) and its significance with respect to ethnobotanical richness in
   other Biosphere Reserves in Mexico (Mann-Whitney test), and similarities
   in the diversity of exotic species (Sorensen index) were studied.
   Results and discussion The ethnobotanical information registers 158
   species and 132 genera in 57 vascular and non-vascular families,
   documenting a greater knowledge and use of cultivated species (84) with
   respect to wild species (74). The diversity of plants reported is
   compared to other ethnobotanical studies carried out in Mexican
   Biosphere Reserves. These results are highly relevant, in spite of
   unique exotic species. The people local pay special attention to
   medicinal and ornamental plants. The species that presented the highest
   use values are Larrea tridentata, Jatropha dioica, and Machaeranthera
   pinnatifida, three species characteristic of the desert region.
   Conclusions The particular diversity of wild flora in Cuatrocienegas
   Valley, combined with the varied introduced flora, is an important
   multifunctional resource. Special attention to introduced species is
   associated with harvesting use restrictions in the protected area as
   well as the high value of ornamental species that are difficult to
   maintain in desert areas. The extensive use of ethnobotanical knowledge
   is an example that biocultural diversity (at the conceptual level) is
   also strongly associated with socio-ecological systems incorporating
   mestizo groups and semi-urban rural landscapes, thus ceasing to be an
   exclusive focus of indigenous communities and regions.},

   woodlands, Christchurch},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},

Pages = {149-162},
Abstract = {Urban forests are increasingly valued for multiple benefits such as
   amenity, cultural values, native biodiversity, ecosystem services, and
   carbon sequestration. Urban biodiversity in particular, is the new focus
   although global homogenisation is undermining regional differentiation.
   In the northern hemisphere (e.g., Canada and USA) and in the southern
   hemisphere, particularly in countries like South Africa, Australia,
   South America and New Zealand, local biodiversity is further impacted by
   historical colonisation from Europe. After several centuries, urban
   forests are now composed of synthetic and spontaneous mixtures of native
   species, and exotic species from around the temperate world (e.g.,
   Europe, North and South America, South Africa, Asia). As far as we are
   aware no-one has carried out in-depth study of these synthetic forests
   in any Southern Hemisphere city. Here we describe the composition,
   structure, and biodiversity conservation imperatives of urban temperate
   forests at 90 random locations in Christchurch city, New Zealand.
   We document considerable plant diversity; the total number of species
   encountered in the 253 sampled urban forest patches was 486. Despite
   this incredibly variable data set, our ability to explain variation in
   species richness was surprisingly good and clearly indicates that total
   species richness was higher in larger patches with greater litter and
   vegetation cover, and taller canopy height. Species richness was also
   higher in patches surrounded by higher population densities and closer
   to very large native forest patches. Native species richness was higher
   in patches with higher soil pH, lower canopy height, and greater litter
   cover and in patches closer to very large native forest patches
   indicating dispersal out of native areas and into gardens. Eight
   distinct forest communities were identified by Two-Way INdicator SPecies
   ANalysis (TWINSPAN) using the occurrence of 241 species that occurred in
   more than two out of all 253 forest patches.
   Christchurch urban forest canopies were dominated by exotic tree species
   in parklands and in street tree plantings (linear parkland). Native tree
   and shrub species were not as common in public spaces but their overall
   density high in residential gardens. There was some explanatory power in
   our data, since less deprivation resulted in greater diversity and
   density, and more native species, which in turn is associated with
   private ownership. We hypothesise that a number of other factors, which
   were not well reflected in our measured environmental variables, are
   responsible for much of the remaining variation in the plant community
   structure, e.g., advertising, peoples choice. For a more sustainable
   asset base of native trees in New Zealand cities we need more,
   longer-lived native species, in large public spaces, including a greater
   proportion of species that bear fruit and nectar suitable for native
   wildlife. We may then achieve cities with ecological integrity that
   present multiple historical dimensions, and sequester carbon in legible
   landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Exploring Floridians' perceptions of pollinator-friendly gardening to
   identify critical adoption barriers and strategies},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Developed landscapes in urban and peri-urban environments significantly
   influence the diversity, abundance, and overall health of pollinator
   populations such as bees, butterflies, moths, and birds. Considering
   growing evidence demonstrating that pollinator health can be more robust
   in urban habitats than rural ones, the landscape development and
   management practices adopted in urban and suburban areas have a
   significant potential impact on pollinator health. Given their influence
   with respect to urban and suburban landscape management in Florida, it
   is critical to better understand the knowledge, attitudes, and
   perceptions of Florida residents regarding pollinator-friendly gardening
   practices such as the flowering plant installation or reduced pesticide
   application. To explore the most salient factors influencing residents'
   adoption of pollinator gardening practices, we facilitated three
   elicitation focus groups with 20 residents representing three distinct
   regions in Florida. Data analysis generated a series of salient
   sub-themes across two thematic categories: `barriers' and `solutions and
   strategies'. Major `barrier' themes included `limited knowledge or
   information access' about pollinator gardening, and `social
   norms/community expectations'. Major solution and strategy' themes
   included `developing neighborhood/homeowner association buy-in,' and
   `pre-installation research and planning'. Overall, findings demonstrate
   that Florida residents have strong views regarding both the most
   influential barriers to adopting or engaging in pollinator-friendly
   gardening and the most promising solutions or strategies to mitigate
   those barriers. These findings have tangible implications for
   educational practitioners interested in expanding distribution of
   targeted educational outreach to further promote the adoption of
   pollinator-friendly landscape management practices in Florida. Findings
   also have implications for researchers interested in further examining
   the socio-economic and socio-cultural factors most influential to
   residents' pollinator gardening practices.},

Title = {How can residents protect and promote pollinators? The diffusion of
   residential pollinator-friendly gardening},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {345},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Urbanization and land use change are leading causes of declines in
   pollinator abundance and diversity. However, researchers in different
   regions of the world have found that some pollinators can thrive in
   urban landscapes, depending on land use practices, environmental
   conditions, and species traits. Residential landscapes constitute a
   significant portion of urban green space and thus, residents' adoption
   of landscape practices to promote pollinators can play a central role in
   addressing the global pollinator challenge. Yet, although residents'
   willingness and intention appear strong, adoption of pollinator-friendly
   gardening remains low. The present study - guided by the Diffusion of
   Innovations theory - aimed to build empirical understanding by surveying
   1598 Florida residents on their experiences and perceptions related to
   pollinator-friendly gardening to determine the most salient barriers and
   opportunities to engagement. Key findings suggest making the practice
   more widely observable and reducing perceived complexity in learning to
   do the practice are critical to promoting adoption. This demonstrates,
   in practical terms, that: (1) targeted efforts to build residents'
   actionable knowledge about pollinator-friendly gardening may
   significantly reduce uncertainty and boost the likelihood of adoption;
   and (2) examples of active pollinator gardens need to be more widely
   showcased and popularized (e.g., through experiential or virtual
   demonstrations). We also found most residents living in homeowner
   associations (HOAs) believed HOA policies on pollinator-friendly
   gardening were restrictive or the residents were unsure whether they are
   allowed to practice pollinator-friendly gardening. Given these
   perceptions strongly associated with residents' low intent to engage in
   pollinator-friendly gardening, a major opportunity exists to diffuse the
   practice and increase adoption by working with HOAs and community
   leaders to become promoters of - rather than barriers to -
   pollinator-friendly gardening.},

Title = {Barriers to Native Plantings in Private Residential Yards},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In urban areas, private yards can make up large portions of the
   available ``green space{''} which can be used to provide resources for
   many species, including birds, and pollinators. If residents are
   persuaded or willing to plant certain native plants, the aggregate
   effect of these plantings could be hugely beneficial for key pollinator
   species. The objectives of this study are to uncover impediments to
   adding different types of pollinator-beneficial plants to private yards,
   as well as ascertain which incentives to plant these native plants might
   be most persuasive, and finally determine if there are procedural
   knowledge gaps in how to plant, care for, or where to purchase three
   pollinator-beneficial plants. In this study, we randomly selected
   properties in two counties in southwestern Ohio along two gradients:
   parcel size and parcel valuation (as a proxy for income). Two hundred
   surveys were distributed and 113 were returned (57\% response rate). We
   find that, in aggregate, respondents do not have a strong intent to
   plant these native plants, especially Asclepias syriaca (a milkweed that
   serves as host plant to the iconic monarch butterfly; Danaus plexippus)
   and, surprisingly, the intent to plant these does not differ
   statistically even when help with costs, labor, or the provision of
   online resources are offered. We also find that the reported knowledge
   of where to purchase wildflowers is significantly higher than how to
   care for them and how to plant them. Lastly, respondents are much more
   confident in how to take care of trees compared to the three
   pollinator-beneficial plants shown in the survey. We discuss the
   implications of these findings for outreach and extension purposes.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urbanisation drives overall declines in insect pollinators. Although
   urban green spaces can provide suitable habitat for pollinators much
   remains to be learned about how urban landscapes either promote or
   negatively impact pollinators. We investigated how backyard design,
   local (100 m) and landscape (500 m) scale vegetation cover and human
   population density were associated with non-eusocial native bee species,
   eusocial bees (Apis mellifera and Tetragonula spp.), and hoverflies, in
   residential green spaces of the subtropical city Brisbane, Australia. We
   found that associations between bee abundance and vegetation cover were
   moderated by human density, but the direction of this effect differed
   for non-eusocial and eusocial species. Non-eusocial bee abundance was
   positively associated with tree cover at local and landscape scales when
   human densities were low, but negatively so at high human population
   densities. We suggest this may be because the quality of vegetation for
   non-eusocial bees deteriorates as human density increases. In contrast,
   abundance of eusocial bees was negatively associated with increasing
   local cover of grass and shrubs at low levels of human density, but
   positively associated at high densities. This affinity to humans could
   partly be explained by domesticated ``kept{''} hives. We found no effect
   of urban gradients on bee species richness. Hoverfly abundance was
   negatively related to human density and positively related to vegetation
   cover at local and landscape scales. At the backyard scale, both bee
   species richness and bee and hoverfly abundances were positively
   associated to flower abundance. Backyards with more vegetation cover had
   higher densities of non-eusocial bees. Our results thus support the idea
   that urban greening in densely populated areas at multiple spatial
   scales can benefit a range of insect pollinators.},

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {293-302},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Urban landscapes are often florally rich due to extensive management of
   cultivated plants around the city. High abundance and diversity of these
   floral resources has been linked to more abundant and diverse pollinator
   communities, but little is known about how urban pollinators select from
   the wide variety of available flowers. This study provides unique
   insight into urban plant-pollinator interactions by examining how many
   plant taxa, and which taxa, are visited by pollinators. Over a
   three-year period, we observed foraging of urban pollinators across 63
   neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois (USA). We observed 1815
   plant-pollinator interactions between 24 pollinator morpho-types and 106
   plant taxa. An additional 57 plant taxa were flowering but not visited
   by pollinators. On average, each pollinator morpho-type visited 19 plant
   taxa, and most pollinators showed generalist tendencies. We identified
   42 plant taxa that were visited by more pollinator morpho-types than
   their floral abundance would predict; we call these `highly attractive'
   plants. In general, perennial and native plants received more pollinator
   visits than their counterparts, and ornamental plants were visited by
   more species than unintentional `weeds'. However, the two most-visited
   plant taxa were non-native, perennial weeds. Our results suggest that
   many flowering plants in cities are not visited by pollinators.
   Furthermore, the plant-pollinator network could be reduced to only four
   plant taxa without losing any pollinator morpho-types. To enhance urban
   pollinator conservation, urban residents can select ornamental plants
   from our list of `highly attractive' plant taxa, or can allow some of
   the highly attractive `weeds' to persist in their gardens.},

   diversity in suburban yards},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {221},
Pages = {160-174},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Green spaces embedded within the urban matrix, particularly residential
   yards, could mitigate negative aspects of urban development and provide
   pollinator habitat. Lawns represent a dominant green space, and their
   management consists of frequent mowing to inhibit the growth of
   ostensibly ``weedy{''} species (e.g., dandelions and clover). Since
   widespread population declines of bees and other pollinators from
   habitat loss are a growing concern, these spontaneous flowers could
   provide pollen and nectar sources throughout the growing season. We
   experimentally tested whether different lawn mowing frequencies (1, 2 or
   3 weeks) influenced bee abundance and diversity in 16 suburban western
   Massachusetts yards by increasing lawn floral resources. Lawns mowed
   every three weeks had as much as 2.5 times more lawn flowers than the
   other frequencies. Interestingly, lawns mowed every two weeks supported
   the highest bee abundance yet the lowest bee richness and evenness. We
   suggest these patterns were driven by a combination of more abundant
   floral resources (compared with 1-week yards), easier access to lawn
   flowers due to shorter grass and a more drastic impact on grass biomass
   and floral resources (compared with 3-week yards), and the dominance of
   a few generalist bees overwhelming our samples, thus driving richness
   and evenness. Our results highlight a ``lazy lawnmower{''} approach to
   providing bee habitat. Mowing less frequently is practical, economical,
   and a timesaving alternative to lawn replacement or even planting
   pollinator gardens. Given the pervasiveness of lawns coupled with
   habitat loss, our findings provide immediate solutions for individual
   households to contribute to urban conservation.},

   163,000 km(2) of the United States, and 50\% of urban and suburban

   support a diversity of spontaneous (e.g., not planted) flowers, with the
   potential to provide nectar and pollen resources for pollinators such as
   native bees. In order to determine the extent to which suburban lawns
   support these important species, we surveyed lawns in 17 suburban yards

   number of individuals were similar. We documented 63 plant species in

   most abundant lawn flowers were dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and
   clover (Trifolium sp.). Nearly 30\% of the spontaneous plant species
   growing in the lawns were native to North America. Our study suggests

Abstract = {Plantings in residential neighborhoods can support wild pollinators.
   However, it is unknown how effectively wild pollinators maintain
   pollination services in small, urban gardens with diverse floral
   resources. We used a `mobile garden' experimental design, whereby potted
   plants of cucumber, eggplant, and purple coneflower were brought to 30
   residential yards in Chicago, IL, USA, to enable direct assessment of
   pollination services provided by wild pollinator communities. We
   measured fruit and seed set and investigated the effect of within-yard
   characteristics and adjacent floral resources on plant pollination.
   Increased pollinator visitation and taxonomic richness generally led to
   increases in fruit and seed set for all focal plants. Furthermore, fruit
   and seed set were correlated across the three species, suggesting that
   pollination services vary across the landscape in ways that are
   consistent among different plant species. Plant species varied in terms
   of which pollinator groups provided the most visits and benefit for
   pollination. Cucumber pollination was linked to visitation by small
   sweat bees (Lasioglossum spp.), whereas eggplant pollination was linked
   to visits by bumble bees. Purple coneflower was visited by the most
   diverse group of pollinators and, perhaps due to this phenomenon, was
   more effectively pollinated in florally-rich gardens. Our results
   demonstrate how a diversity of wild bees supports pollination of
   multiple plant species, highlighting the importance of pollinator
   conservation within cities. Non-crop resources should continue to be
   planted in urban gardens, as these resources have a neutral and
   potentially positive effect on crop pollination.},

Abstract = {Networks of urban green space can provide critical resources for wild
   bees, however it is unclear which attributes of green spaces provide
   these resources, or how their management can be improved to benefit a
   diversity of bee species. We examined bee communities in three dominant
   urban green space habitats: (1) golf courses (2) public parks and (3)
   front gardens and streetscapes in residential neighbourhoods in
   Melbourne, Australia and assessed which local and landscape attributes
   influenced bee communities. There was a greater abundance and richness
   of bee species in public parks compared to golf courses and residential
   neighbourhoods, where the latter habitat was dominated by European
   Honeybees (Apis mellifera). The occurrence of A. mellifera was
   positively associated with increases in flowering and native plants.
   Ground-nesting Homalictus species occurred more frequently in older golf
   courses and public parks surrounded by low impervious surface cover, and
   with a low diversity of flowering plants. Cavity nesting, floral
   specialists within the Colletidae family occurred more often in green
   space habitats with greater native vegetation, and occurred infrequently
   in residential neighbourhoods. The lack of appropriate nesting habitat
   and dominance of exotic flowering plants in residential neighbourhoods

   negatively affected cavity and ground nesting floral specialist bee

   to include urban areas in pollinator conservation initiatives, as
   providing resources critical to diverse bee communities can assist in
   maintaining these key pollinators in urban landscapes. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Evaluation of the most popular annual flowers sold in the United States
   and Europe indicates low visitation rates by pollinators and large
   variation among cultivars},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 13},
Abstract = {To better understand how frequently pollinators visit the most popular
   annuals and the variation among cultivars, we evaluated 3-6 cultivars,
   each of petunia, impatiens, begonia, geranium, pansy, and New Guinea
   impatiens. These 6 annuals account for 46.6\% of all garden center
   annual flower sales in the United States. Flower visits by honey bees,
   bumble bees, syrphids, other Diptera and other Hymenoptera, combined,
   varied 3 to 10-fold among cultivars within each of the 6 popular
   annuals. Begonia and impatiens were visited more frequently by
   pollinators than pansy, petunia, NG impatiens, and geranium. The 4 most
   visited cultivars, begonia `Cocktail Brandy', begonia `Ambassador Rose
   Blush', impatiens `Accent Coral', and impatiens `Super Elfin XP White'
   attracted as many pollinators as a benchmark annual, marigold `Alumia
   Vanilla Cream', considered as moderately attractive to pollinators. Some
   conclusions from this research may be helpful for homeowners,
   landscapers, growers, and breeders. First, the most popular annual
   flowers are not a good choice for the purpose of attracting and
   supporting pollinators. However, the large variation among cultivars
   provides an opportunity to select cultivars that are more attractive to
   pollinators, particularly for begonia and impatiens. If the most
   pollinator-visited cultivars of begonia and impatiens are labeled and
   promoted as such, it would be beneficial to pollinators in urban and
   suburban landscapes in the USA and Europe, where they comprise 10\%-20\%
   of all annual flowers purchased from garden centers.},

   Neighborhoods},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE WATER IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) promises to improve stormwater
   management while making landscapes more sustainable. The ability of GSI
   to achieve water quality objectives and provide socioeconomic cobenefits
   depends in part on public perceptions and support. This study
   contributes to the literature on public perceptions of top-down,
   municipal-scale GSI. We examined variation in public support for planned
   rain gardens and the factors associated with support in a large
   Midwestern city in the US. We collected survey data (N=588) in two
   socioeconomically distinct neighborhoods and fit multivariate linear
   regression models to explore how variables derived from economics,
   landscape ecology, and outreach and engagement literatures impact
   support. There was little difference in support between neighborhoods.
   The expectation of increased property values and improved neighborhood
   appearance, alignment with personal norms and experience with
   conservation landscaping, and satisfaction with outreach and engagement
   programs were significantly associated with higher support. In addition,
   strong neighborhood identity magnified the effects of several variables.
   These results suggest that planners should work with communities to
   identify rain garden designs and locations that balance functionality
   with aesthetic preferences to minimize potential negative socioeconomic
   effects while meeting stormwater management objectives. Proactive
   community engagement that is attentive to local norms and values and
   identifies appropriate rain garden maintenance plans could improve the
   long-term effectiveness of GSI by increasing the likelihood of local
   support.
   Cities are increasingly using technologies called green stormwater
   infrastructure (GSI) to manage drainage water, including flooding and
   sewage overflows to waterways. Common examples of GSI in urban areas are
   rain gardens and permeable pavement. Vegetated with perennial plants,
   rain gardens potentially offer additional benefits to urban environments
   such as pollinator habitat, lower summer heat, and improved community
   aesthetics, which can enhance health and well-being from activities like
   increased exercise. However, installing rain gardens alters the
   landscape, which can be viewed positively or negatively by residents.
   Public views on rain gardens are important because if viewed negatively,
   fewer people benefit and otherwise-effective GSI programs could fail to
   be pursued. On the other hand, community support for GSI could lead to
   long-term viability of the infrastructure and its benefits. We studied
   public perceptions of GSI in Columbus, Ohio, where the city planned to
   install rain gardens throughout residential neighborhoods. Residents
   were more likely to be supportive of planned rain gardens if they (1)
   felt they would improve their property values and appearance of the
   neighborhood, (2) felt sufficiently informed by the city about the rain
   garden plans, and (3) already had experience with conservation
   landscaping at home.},

Title = {Native flora receive more visits than exotics from bees, especially
   native bees, in an urbanised biodiversity hotspot},
Journal = {PACIFIC CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Context Identifying floral resources preferred by bee assemblages is
   important for their conservation.Aims Here, I assess the association of
   flowering plant community composition, with that of honey bees and
   native bee abundance and diversity. I investigate flower preferences in
   terms of plant origin (native or exotic), and evaluate niche breadth, of
   introduced honey bees and native bee taxa. I also consider if habitat
   influences these patterns.Methods This was evaluated through recording
   flower visitation by honey bees and native bees in the urbanised region
   of the south-west Western Australian Floristic Region in seven bushland
   remnants and seven residential gardens over 2 years.Key results Both
   native bees and honey bees visited more native than exotic flora,
   however native bees visited a higher proportion of native flora than
   honey bees. The 10-most visited plants by native bees were exclusively
   native, whereas for honey bees, although their 10-most visited plants
   were predominantly native plant species, this selection also included
   exotic plant species. Niche breadth was broader in bushland remnants,
   indicating a greater range of preferred flora in bushland remnants.
   Honey bees however visited more plant families in residential gardens.
   With increased honey bee abundance, this was associated with native bees
   expanding their niche breadth, which may be a response to reduce
   competition. Flower preference patterns and niche breadth often differed
   between habitats, indicating that foraging patterns may be mediated by
   habitat context.Conclusion Native flora are preferred by bees, and
   native bees have relatively restricted flower preferences, especially
   compared with honey bees.Implications High proportions of preferred
   native flora are needed to support diverse native bee assemblages in
   urban areas.
   In the urbanised areas of the south-west Western Australian biodiversity
   hotspot, both native bees and honey bees visit more native than exotic
   flora, however native bees visit a higher proportion of native flora
   than honey bees. Conserving bees in urban greenspaces requires high
   proportions of preferred native flora.},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {With urbanisation leading to loss of nesting resources, and increasing
   public interest in helping bees, bee hotels (trap-nests) are becoming
   popularised. However, their success is relatively understudied. The
   influence of habitat type in determining occupancy and emergence is also
   poorly known. Over two years across 7 bushland remnant and 7 residential
   garden sites, trap-nests were installed and completed nests collected
   monthly over spring-summer. Bees appeared to take a month to find the
   trap-nests, irrespective of month they were installed. A small
   percentage (13\% and 6\% in the two years) of tubes were occupied, but
   this was within the range of other trap-nesting studies. Smaller 4 and 7
   mm diameter nests had a higher occupancy rate than 10 mm diameter tubes.
   An impressive number - 24 bee species - occupied the trap-nests.
   Representation however was dominated by five species. The species
   composition (species and their relative abundances) of cavity-nesting
   bees differed greatly between those using the trap-nests compared with
   those observed in the field. Bushland remnants tended to have more bee
   hotels occupied, and male body size of emerged bees was larger in this
   habitat. Unexpectedly native and total flower diversity reduced bee
   hotel occupancy, whereas native flower parameters tended to positively
   influence bee fitness. Overall installing bee hotels can provide
   additional nesting resources for native bees in urbanised areas, and
   providing high proportions of native flora in the vicinity should
   enhance fitness of the bees using them.},

Abstract = {Nectar and pollen are floral resources that provide food for insect
   pollinators, so quantifying their supplies can help us to understand and
   mitigate pollinator declines. However, most existing datasets of floral
   resource measurements focus on native plants found in rural landscapes,
   so cannot be used effectively for estimating supplies in urban green
   spaces, where non-native ornamental plants often predominate.We sampled
   floral nectar sugar in 225 plant taxa found in UK residential gardens
   and other urban green spaces, focussing on the most common species. The
   vast majority (94\%) of our sampled taxa are non-native, filling an
   important research gap and ensuring these data are also relevant outside
   of the United Kingdom.Our dataset includes values of daily nectar sugar
   production for all 225 taxa and nectar sugar concentration for around
   half (102) of those sampled. Nectar extraction was conducted according
   to published methods, ensuring our values can be combined with other
   datasets.We anticipate that the two main uses of these data are (1) to
   estimate the nectar production of habitats and landscapes and (2) to
   identify high-nectar plants of conservation importance. To increase the
   utility of our data, we provide guidance for scaling nectar values up

Abstract = {The ratio of green areas belonging to residential areas and their
   location in the city is too important to ignore. However, when we look
   at urban planning, it is seen that green areas belonging to common
   public areas are generally evaluated within the scope of ecosystem
   services, while residential gardens that are within the scope of private
   property are ignored. In this context, the main purpose of the study is
   to examine the contribution of the residential gardens, in which the
   landscape value is kept to the forefront, to the ecosystem services.
   Within the scope of this main purpose, this study analyzes how the green
   areas of the residential gardens in Trabzon can be designed through a
   focus on green infrastructure (GI) within the axis of landscape value
   and how these designs will serve the ecosystem services in this
   perspective. Following the study, it has been determined that both
   spatial needs and ecosystem benefits can be met with the same GI
   elements, while, on the other hand, it has been conferred that the
   landscape value, as a significant factor in the design of residential
   gardens, is supported by several GI elements of an edible garden,
   pollinator garden, rain garden, biological pond, and green roof. It has
   been determined that GI elements, where vegetation and water landscape
   elements are used together, have a higher potential for ecosystem
   services. In addition, it has been concluded that the green areas of the
   residential gardens should not be planned and designed solely within
   their own areas. Based on these analyses, it has been determined that
   the benefits are considerably increased when the green areas of the
   residential gardens are planned and designed through a holistic
   GI-oriented design approach based on the total building parcel. Thus, it
   is very important to consider GI systems with a holistic approach in
   residential gardens throughout the city. This holistic approach will
   allow the benefits of GI to be spread throughout the city and will
   ensure that the benefits are homogenized within the city.},

Abstract = {Bipartite networks of flowering plants and their visitors (potential

   in understanding the ecology of plant-pollinator networks and how this

   invasive species, there is no consensus about the scale at which such
   networks should be constructed and analysed. Ecologists, however, have
   emphasised that many processes are scale dependent. Here, we compare
   network- and species-level properties of ecological networks analysed at
   the level of a site, pooling across sites within a given habitat for
   each month of surveys, and pooling across all sites and months to create
   a single network per habitat type. We additionally considered how these
   three scales of resolution influenced conclusions regarding differences
   between networks according to two contrasting habitat types (urban
   bushland remnants and residential gardens) and the influence of honey
   bee abundance on network properties. We found that most network
   properties varied markedly depending on the scale of analysis, as did
   the significance, or lack thereof, of habitat type and honey bee
   abundance on network properties. We caution against pooling across sites
   and months as this can create unrealistic links, invalidating
   conclusions on network structure. In conclusion, consideration of scale
   of analysis is also important when conducting and interpreting

Abstract = {Landscape composition and its related functional agrobiodiversity (FAB)
   was severely simplified during the last decades. As landscape
   composition is expected to influence the interrelated microclimate and
   arthropod community at different scales, this simplification might have
   led to a decline in multiple agro-ecosystem services, with potential
   impacts for the growth of crops with different demands from the
   environment. To study landscape-scale effects on multicrop yield and
   herbivory in combination with its potential drivers, including
   functional arthropod community and microclimate, we used standardised 1
   m(2) mini-gardens planted with ten different vegetable crops as
   phytometers. The gardens were installed at locations varying in
   surrounding landscape composition and the vegetables were selected to
   have contrasting requirements in terms of growing conditions,
   pollination services and susceptibility to pests. Monitoring of the
   mini-gardens was performed in 2018 and 2019 in Flanders (Belgium). We
   found no relationship between landscape composition in a 500 m radius
   and crop yield. Considering possible mechanisms, we found that an
   increasing share of woody vegetation (>3 m high) in the surrounding
   landscape is important to buffer the temperature and soil moisture
   variation in the mini-gardens. The share of agricultural land use and
   urban green (<3 m high) is, respectively, positively and negatively
   related with the activity-density of natural enemies and pollinators.
   The growth of different crops responded differently to higher
   temperature ranges and we found no relation between natural enemies and
   herbivory. In conclusion, these abiotic and biotic pathways did not
   cause an overall relationship between landscape composition and yield.
   Synthesis and applications. These outcomes indicate that woody
   vegetation in the rural landscape buffers soil moisture and temperature
   variation, which will become even more important due to climate change.
   Furthermore, pollinators and natural enemies were most active in rural
   environments and less active in areas with residential green and
   built-up surfaces. Local, flower rich habitat, such as road sides, can
   further support natural enemies and buffer soil moisture variation. Yet,
   high arthropod activity is no assurance for arthropod mediated ecosystem
   service delivery nor is microclimate buffering an assurance for higher
   crop yields.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Electric powerline corridors are informal green spaces that encompass
   large areas of land and have the potential to support biodiversity in
   urban and suburban landscapes. However, the extent to which these
   corridors provide novel habitats compared to the surrounding landscape
   is unclear. Biodiversity in corridors is often compared to that of
   ``natural{''} habitats despite the fact that the corridors are subject
   to frequent vegetation management. In urban and suburban landscapes,
   residential yards may provide a more appropriate comparison because they
   are a dominant type of green space and are also characterized by
   frequent vegetation management. We conducted a study of the biodiversity
   in suburban powerline corridors in northern Illinois, USA, and compared
   it to the biodiversity found in nearby residential yards. Our goal was
   to determine whether powerline corridors added ecological value to these
   suburban landscapes. We included three different management styles of
   powerline corridors: (1) frequently mowed and kept as lawn, (2) brush
   mowed on a five-year cycle ({''}old-field{''}), and (3) restored and/or
   maintained as native prairie. We measured the species richness and
   composition of plants, birds, and insect pollinators in corridors and
   yards. The corridor management types and comparison yards differed
   significantly in the richness of all three taxa, with old-field and/or
   prairie sites having greater species richness than mown corridors and/or
   comparison yards. Community composition also differed by management
   category. While the species richness of old-field sites tended to be
   high, prairie sites generally had more species of conservation interest.
   Our study shows that both old-field- and prairie-managed powerline
   corridors add habitat value to Midwestern U.S. suburban landscapes by
   providing alternative habitat types that support many species.
   Nonetheless, we suggest that managers looking to specifically support
   native and/or grassland specialist species in this region should manage

Title = {An Ecosystem Service Approach to Assessing Agro-Ecosystems in Urban
   Landscapes},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Creating sustainable urban landscapes in light of growing population
   pressures requires interdisciplinary multi-functional solutions.
   Alternative agro-ecosystems described as food forests, permaculture
   gardens, and/or edible landscapes among others could offer potential
   ways to address the social, economic, and ecological goals of various
   stakeholders simultaneously. Current research is lacking a comprehensive
   tool that can assess the performance of alternative agro-ecosystems that
   have both functional and aesthetic values. The present research uses a
   novel rubric, the Permaculture and Agro-ecosystems Sustainability
   Scorecard (PASS) that combines agricultural sustainability and ecosystem
   services (ES) indicators in order to assess alternative agro-ecosystems.
   The rubric evaluates provisioning, regulating, supporting, economic and
   cultural ES and includes benefits such as pollinator presence, increased
   biodiversity, alternative pesticides and fertilizer use, carbon
   sequestration, food security, and human interactions. Based on the
   concepts and principles drawn from four popular frameworks and
   sub-disciplines, namely, SAFE, SITES, permaculture, and agroecology, we
   identify sixteen broad ES indicators and 59 sub-indices and measure them
   using data collected through site observation, survey, interviews, and
   documentary research. For easy comparison across different urban
   agriculture sites, the above sub-indices are further aggregated into
   five ES criteria using stakeholder-informed weights. The weights are
   developed through pair-wise comparison of criteria by sample survey
   respondents. The PASS framework is used to score twelve sites in South
   Florida that meet specific criteria in the small farm, residential, and
   public space categories. Sample respondents place the highest weight on
   cultural services. Contrary to the popular notion of promoting urban
   agriculture for food security, the results show that the majority of the
   sites score highest in the supporting services provided, followed by
   regulating and cultural services, and lowest in the economic services
   category. The supporting service for most of the sample sites score
   consistently very high, close to the highest possible level of 5.0.
   There is a wide variation in provisioning and economic values across the
   study sites. The paper offers several ideas for mainstreaming the ES
   indicators into urban planning and decision-making and some of the
   practical difficulties one might face along the way. We conclude that in
   order to realize the broader ES benefits of urban agriculture in
   particular and agro-ecosystems in general, a multi-pronged policy and
   planning approach is necessary.},

Title = {Can biodiverse streetscapes mitigate the effects of noise and air
   pollution on human wellbeing?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {212},
Number = {A},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Most of the global population are urban, with inhabitants exposed to
   raised levels of pollution. Pollutants negatively impact human
   wellbeing, and can alter the structure and diversity of ecosystems.
   Contrastingly, urban biodiversity can positively contribute to human
   wellbeing. We know little, however, about whether the negative impacts
   of pollution on wellbeing could be lessened for householders living on
   more biodiverse streets, as the complex interlinkages between pollution,
   biodiversity and wellbeing have rarely been examined. Here, we used
   structural equation modelling to simultaneously test whether
   biodiversity (actual and perceived) mediates the relationship between
   traffic-related pollution (noise, dB; nitrogen dioxide, NO2) or air
   pollution (PM2.5) and wellbeing (mental wellbeing, happiness). In summer
   2019, we conducted questionnaires and biodiversity surveys, and
   collected noise and air pollution data, from households (n = 282) across
   the streetscapes of Leeds, UK. Biodiversity (actual or perceived) showed
   no mediating effects. However, increased flowering plant richness was
   positively associated with mental wellbeing. Traffic-related pollution
   negatively affected pollinator and flowering plant richness, but not
   wellbeing. This could be because householders are not exposed to high
   levels of noise or NO2 because they do not maintain front gardens on
   noisier streets. There was no measurable effect of air pollution on
   biodiversity or wellbeing. These findings shed light on the complex
   mechanisms through which biodiversity could improve human wellbeing.
   Enhancing the diversity of plant species in streetscapes would have a
   positive effect on wellbeing, further emphasising the important role
   that biodiverse urban streetscapes play in improving the liveability of
   cities.},

Title = {Turnover in floral composition explains species diversity and temporal

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Pages = {801-811},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Residential gardens are a valuable habitat for insect pollinators
   worldwide, but differences in individual gardening practices
   substantially affect their floral composition. It is important to
   understand how the floral resource supply of gardens varies in both
   space and time so we can develop evidence-based management
   recommendations to support pollinator conservation in towns and cities.
   We surveyed 59 residential gardens in the city of Bristol, UK, at
   monthly intervals from March to October. For each of 472 garden surveys,
   we combined floral abundances with nectar sugar data to quantify the
   nectar production of each garden, investigating the magnitude, temporal
   stability, and diversity and composition of garden nectar supplies. We
   found that individual gardens differ markedly in the quantity of nectar
   sugar they supply (from 2 to 1,662 g), and nectar production is higher
   in more affluent neighbourhoods, but not in larger gardens. Nectar
   supply peaks in July (mid-summer), when more plant taxa are in flower,
   but temporal patterns vary among individual gardens. At larger spatial
   scales, temporal variability averages out through the portfolio effect,
   meaning insect pollinators foraging across many gardens in urban
   landscapes have access to a relatively stable and continuous supply of
   nectar through the year. Turnover in species composition among gardens
   leads to an extremely high overall plant richness, with 636 taxa
   recorded flowering. The nectar supply is dominated by non-natives, which
   provide 91\% of all nectar sugar, while shrubs are the main plant life
   form contributing to nectar production (58\%). Two-thirds of nectar
   sugar is only available to relatively specialised pollinators, leaving
   just one-third that is accessible to all. Synthesis and applications. By
   measuring nectar supply in residential gardens, our study demonstrates
   that pollinator-friendly management, affecting garden quality, is more
   important than the size of a garden, giving every gardener an
   opportunity to contribute to pollinator conservation in urban areas. For
   gardeners interested in increasing the value of their land to foraging
   pollinators, we recommend planting nectar-rich shrubs with complementary
   flowering periods and prioritising flowers with an open structure in
   late summer and autumn.},

Title = {Urban native vegetation remnants support more diverse native bee
   communities than residential gardens in Australia's southwest
   biodiversity hotspot},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {265},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Native bees are declining in many regions, often associated with loss of
   natural habitat. Urbanisation replaces natural vegetation with a
   highly-modified landscape, where residential gardens are a major
   component of urban greenspace. While many cities retain native
   vegetation remnants within the urban matrix, these are often small,
   isolated and degraded. However, there is little empirical evidence on
   the capacity of residential gardens to provide equivalent or beneficial
   habitat for native bees, and which local and landscape factors influence
   bee assemblages. We surveyed bee assemblages in the southwest Australian
   biodiversity hotspot at seven residential gardens and seven bushland
   remnants over two years. We recorded 153 species/morphospecies of native
   bees. Native bees were more abundant in bushland remnants than
   residential gardens. Abundance of the introduced honeybee Apis mellifera
   was generally high, and did not differ between habitats. Bushland
   remnants hosted more species, and rare and unique species, than did
   residential gardens. Native bee body-size and nesting guilds varied in
   their response to habitat type. Native bee abundance and richness
   increased with abundance of native plant species, but decreased with
   total flower species richness. Native bee species richness was
   negatively impacted by urbanisation (built space and isolation from
   bushland reserves). There were no significant relationships between
   honeybee abundance and local and landscape factors. Our study
   demonstrates that while residential gardens can host native bees, urban
   bushland remnants harbour a more comprehensive suite of species and are
   key for the conservation of native bee populations.},

Title = {Local plant richness predicts bee abundance and diversity in a study of
   urban residential yards},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {64-73},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding the drivers of biodiversity in cities is a central goal of
   urban ecology. There is currently intense scientific and public interest
   in the factors that influence pollinator diversity in cities and their
   surroundings. Existing studies point to a variety of landscape and local
   factors as potentially important, including urbanization (often defined
   as impervious surface cover in the surrounding lands), tree canopy cover
   and the diversity and abundance of locally flowering plants. However,
   few studies have sought to weigh the relative importance of these
   predictors of bee community metrics. Using a set of 27 residential yards
   chosen to represent a gradient of both urbanization and tree canopy
   cover at a landscape scale, we used pan trapping and netting to assess
   the abundance and diversity of local bee communities across the City of
   Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Surprisingly, the landscape factors
   (urbanization and tree cover) described only a tiny fraction (< 1\%) of
   the total variance in bee abundance and diversity across sites. This was
   true regardless of the scale of analysis at which the landscape factors
   were measured. Instead, a yard's floral richness, and, to a somewhat
   lesser extent, its floral abundance, emerged as the most important
   predictors of a yard's bee community abundance and diversity. Our study
   offers an important counterpoint to a growing body of work emphasizing
   the impacts of landscape factors on bee communities. Instead, our
   research suggests that improving bee floral resources by increasing the
   plant species richness and abundance locally is a powerful tool to
   support bee conservation, regardless of the level of urbanization or
   tree cover in the surrounding landscape. Our work highlights that the
   practice of promoting `bee-friendly' plantings in private yards,
   currently being undertaken by a number of non-profits around the world,
   can play an important role in restoring and maintaining urban pollinator
   communities. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH on

Abstract = {Insect pollinator populations, critical to the global food supply, are
   declining. Research has found robust bee communities in cities, which
   are supported by diverse urban habitat and foraging resources.
   Accounting for 35-50\% of urban green space, U.S. private residential
   yards can serve as important forage and nesting sources for pollinators.
   Incorporating wild attributes and wildness, such as native vegetation
   and less intensive yard-management practices, is key. However, urban
   vegetation, and its effects on local native bee populations, is shaped
   by social and cultural preferences, norms, aesthetics, values, and
   identities. The perfect lawn ideal of a highly manicured turfgrass yard
   dominates neighborhood landscapes and is often at odds with the habitat
   needs of pollinators. As part of a three-year study investigating the
   sociocultural drivers of residential vegetation choices in St. Louis,
   MO, USA, we interviewed 85 decisionmakers in order to understand choices
   about private residential yard maintenance. This paper presents an
   emergent finding concerning how residents conceptualize and talk about
   the urban-yard aesthetic, using the terms ``wild `` and ``wildness ``,
   which reflect a range of levels in the demand for urban wild spaces in
   their neighborhoods. The discourse of wildness offers a nontechnical
   route for understanding the connections between the ecological
   consequences of urbanization, with human attitudes towards nature that
   shape the biological functioning of human-generated habitats.},

Abstract = {European honey bees have been introduced across the globe and may
   compete with native bees for floral resources. Compounding effects of
   urbanization and introduced species on native bees are, however,
   unclear. Here, we investigated how honey bee abundance and foraging
   patterns related to those of native bee abundance and diversity in
   residential gardens and native vegetation remnants for 2 years in
   urbanized areas of the Southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot and
   assessed how niche overlap influenced these relationships. Honeybees did
   not overtly suppress native bee abundance; however, complex
   relationships emerged when analysing these relationships according to
   body size, time of day and floral resource levels. Native bee richness
   was positively correlated with overall honeybee abundance in the first
   year, but negatively correlated in the second year, and varied with body
   size. Native bees that had higher resource overlap with honey bees were
   negatively associated with honey bee abundance, and resource overlap
   between honey bees and native bees was higher in residential gardens.
   Relationships with honey bees varied between native bee taxa, reflecting
   adaptations to different flora, plus specialization. Thus, competition
   with introduced bees varies by species and location, mediated by dietary
   breadth and overlap and by other life-history traits of individual bee

Abstract = {The European honeybee Apis mellifera is a highly successful, abundant
   species and has been introduced into habitats across the globe. As a
   supergeneralist species, the European honeybee has the potential to
   disrupt pollination networks, especially in Australia, whose flora and
   fauna have co-evolved for millions of years. The role of honeybees in
   pollination networks in Australia has been little explored and has never
   been characterised in urban areas, which may favour this exotic species
   due to the proliferation of similarly exotic plant species which this
   hyper-generalist can utilise, unlike many native bee taxa. Here, we use
   a bipartite network approach to compare the roles, in terms of
   species-level properties, of honeybees with native bee taxa in
   bee-flower ('pollination') networks in an urbanised biodiversity
   hotspot. We also assessed whether the abundance of honeybees influences
   overall network structure. Pollination networks were created from
   surveys across seven residential gardens and seven urban native
   vegetation remnants conducted monthly during the spring-summer period
   over two years. There were consistent differences in species-level
   properties between bee taxa, with honeybees often differing from all
   other native bees. Honeybees had significant impacts on network
   properties, being associated with higher nestedness, extinction slopes
   of plants, functional complementarity and niche overlap (year two), as
   well as lower weighted connectance and generalisation. These
   associations all are indicative that competition is occurring between
   the introduced honeybee and the native bee taxa in bee-flower networks.
   In conclusion, the introduced honeybee occupies a dominant, distinct
   position in bee-flower networks in urban habitats in the southwest
   Western Australian biodiversity hotspot and has a major, potentially
   disruptive, influence on plant-pollinator network properties in these
   areas.},

Abstract = {There is increasing interest in developing urban design principles that

   distribution and role of beneficial pollinating insects, in particular,
   is changing our view of the ecological value of cities. With the rapid
   expansion of the built environment comes a need to understand how
   insects may be affected in extensive urban areas. We therefore
   investigated insect pollinator capture rates in a rapidly growing and
   densely urbanized city (Melbourne, Australia). We identified a remnant
   native habitat contained within the expansive urban boundary, and
   established study sites at two nearby populated urban areas. We employed
   standard pan trap sampling techniques to passively sample insect orders
   in the different environments. Our results show that, even though the
   types of taxonomic groups of insects captured are comparable between
   locations, important pollinators like bees and hoverflies were more
   frequently captured in the remnant native habitat. By contrast, beetles
   (Coleoptera) and butterflies/moths (Lepidoptera) were more frequently
   observed in the urban residential regions. Our results suggest that the
   maintenance of native habitat zones within cities is likely to be
   valuable for the conservation of bees and the ecosystem services they

Abstract = {Floral resources (nectar and pollen) provide food for insect pollinators
   but have declined in the countryside due to land use change. Given
   widespread pollinator loss, it is important that we quantify their food
   supply to help develop conservation actions. While nectar resources have
   been measured in rural landscapes, equivalent data are lacking for urban
   areas, an important knowledge gap as towns and cities often host diverse
   pollinator populations.
   We quantified the nectar supply of urban areas, farmland and nature
   reserves in the UK by combining floral abundance and nectar sugar
   production data for 536 flowering plant taxa, allowing us to compare
   landscape types and assess the spatial distribution of nectar sugar
   among land uses within cities.
   The magnitude of nectar sugar production did not differ significantly
   among the three landscapes. In urban areas the nectar supply was more
   diverse in origin and predominantly delivered by non-native flowering
   plants. Within cities, urban land uses varied greatly in nectar sugar
   production. Gardens provided the most nectar sugar per unit area and
   85\% of all nectar at a city scale, while gardens and allotments
   produced the most diverse supplies of nectar sugar. Floral abundance,
   commonly used as a proxy for pollinators' food supply, correlated
   strongly with nectar resources, but left a substantial proportion of the
   variation in nectar supply unexplained.
   Synthesis. We show that urban areas are hotspots of floral resource
   diversity rather than quantity and their nectar supply is underpinned by
   the contribution of residential gardens. Individual gardeners have an
   important role to play in pollinator conservation as ornamental plants,
   usually non-native in origin, are a key source of nectar in towns and
   cities.},

Abstract = {Creating or restoring habitat is a well-established approach to improve
   pollinator populations. Rural and exurban properties might constitute a
   straightforward opportunity to convert land to native plants that are
   beneficial to pollinators given that, in Ohio, these parcels typically
   contain substantial lawn cover. The purpose of this study is to gauge
   the public's acceptance of planting native plants on low-density rural
   properties. Out of 7557 properties in Butler County, Ohio (U.S.A.), that
   had at least 1/4 acre lawn, were between 1 and 20 acres, and had a
   dwelling, 200 were randomly selected to receive a survey; half via the
   drop-off pick-up method and half via mail (for a combined 58\% response
   rate). Pollinator beneficial plants of differing appearance, management,
   and pollinator service were shown in the questionnaire: Echinacea
   purpurea, Monarda fistulosa, Asclepias syriaca, and wildflower prairie
   (multiple species). Respondents were significantly less likely to be
   willing to plant Asclepias syriaca compared to the other plants shown.
   If all respondents planted what they said they would consider planting
   in the more accepted plants, these potentially new plantings would cover
   5.4\% of the 146.2 km(2) devoted to these rural and exurban parcels in
   the county. However, that proportion decreases to 1\% if we only take
   into account those that said they would make those changes within the
   year. We discuss what we see as challenges and opportunities to increase
   pollinator plantings on exurban properties and small working farms in
   the Midwest. We also describe implications for voluntary habitat
   restoration on these private lands.},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Urbanisation is a prominent and increasing form of land-use change, with
   the potential to disrupt the interactions between pollinators such as
   bees and the flowering plants that they visit. This in turn may cause
   cascading local extinctions and have consequences for pollination
   services. Network approaches go beyond simple metrics of abundance and
   species richness, enabling understanding of how the structure of
   plant-pollinator communities are affected by urbanisation. Here we
   compared pollination networks between native vegetation (bushland)
   remnants and residential gardens in the urbanised region of the
   southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot. Across fourteen sites, seven
   per habitat, plant-bee visitor networks were created from surveys
   conducted monthly during the spring-summer period over two years.
   Extinction slope (a measure of how extinctions cascade through the
   network), and network robustness and nestedness were higher for bushland
   remnants, suggesting that networks in bushland remnants had greater
   functional integrity, but if disrupted, more cascading extinctions could
   occur. In contrast, niche overlap between pollinators was higher in
   residential gardens, suggesting greater competition for resources. Most
   species-level properties did not differ between habitats, except for
   normalised degree, which was higher in bushland remnants. In conclusion,
   it appears that pollination networks in managed residential gardens are
   not structurally equivalent with those in bushland remnants. This has
   implications for conservation of wild bee assemblages in this
   biodiversity hotspot, and suggests removal of remnant native vegetation
   for residential development could disrupt the integrity of
   plant-pollinator assemblages.},

Title = {Wild bees and hoverflies respond differently to urbanisation, human
   population density and urban form},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {204},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While urbanisation contributes to global biodiversity declines,
   flower-rich urban habitats may provide beneficial pollinator habitats.
   We investigated the potential of urban residential areas to contribute
   to pollinator diversity by analysing wild bee and hoverfly species
   richness and composition of species assemblages of summer-active
   species, sampled in 53 gardens across urban and rural landscapes of
   Malmo, the regional capital of Sweden's southernmost county. Species
   richness differed between urban and rural gardens, and between four
   urban residential types (ranging from low human density and high
   vegetation cover, to high human density and low vegetation cover), and
   taxonomic groups responded differently. Solitary bee species richness
   was higher in urban than rural gardens, driven by a higher richness in
   low-density urban gardens compared to both high-density urban gardens
   and rural gardens. In contrast, bumblebee species richness was higher in
   rural than urban gardens, whereas differences among the urban types were
   less clear. Hoverfly species richness was consistently higher in rural
   gardens than any urban garden type. Species richness of all groups was
   negatively related to human population density at the landscape scale
   (radius 500 m), but unrelated to vegetation cover. This indicates that
   population density affects pollinator habitat quality through associated
   green space management and design. Rural and urban wild bee species
   assemblages consisted of different species (significant species
   turnover), whereas urban hoverfly assemblages were a subset of rural
   ones (significant nestedness). Species nestedness of hoverflies, but not
   bees, increased with human population density. We show that urban areas
   can complement the regional wild bee species pool, mainly caused by
   large variation in tenure and management at small spatial scales, while
   urbanisation drives a systematic loss of hoverfly species. We suggest
   alternatives to improve dense residential areas for pollinators.},

Abstract = {Urban green spaces such as gardens often consist of native and exotic
   plant species, which provide pollen and nectar for flower-visiting
   insects. Although some exotic plants are readily visited by pollinators,
   it is unknown if and at which time of the season exotic garden plants
   may supplement or substitute for flower resources provided by native
   plants. To investigate if seasonal changes in flower availability from
   native vs. exotic plants affect flower visits, diversity and
   particularly plant-pollinator interaction networks, we studied
   flower-visiting insects over a whole growing season in 20 urban
   residential gardens in Germany. Over the course of the season, visits to
   native plants decreased, the proportion of flower visits to exotics
   increased, and flower-visitor species richness decreased. Yet, the
   decline in flower-visitor richness over the season was slowed in gardens
   with a relatively higher proportion of flowering exotic plants. This
   compensation was more positively linked to the proportion of exotic
   plant species than to the proportion of exotic flower cover.
   Plant-pollinator interaction networks were moderately specialized.
   Interactions were more complex in high summer, but interaction
   diversity, linkage density, and specialisation were not influenced by
   the proportion of exotic species. Thus, later in the season when few
   native plants flowered, exotic garden plants partly substituted for
   native flower resources without apparent influence on plant-pollinator
   network structure. Late-flowering garden plants support pollinator
   diversity in cities. If appropriately managed, and risk of
   naturalisation is minimized, late-flowering exotic plants may provide
   floral resources to support native pollinators when native plants are
   scarce.},

   improving management approaches in urban greenspace and highly urbanised

Abstract = {Urban expansion is correlated to negative biodiversity trends. The
   amount of impervious surfaces in urban areas is a determinant of
   pollinator species assemblages. While the increase in urbanization and
   impervious surfaces negatively impacts pollinators, cities also
   encompass urban green spaces, which have a significant capacity to
   support biodiversity. Among them, domestic gardens that represent a
   non-negligible fraction of green spaces have been shown to benefit
   pollinators. Domestic gardens may form habitat clusters in residential
   areas, although their value at a landscape scale is still unknown. Here,
   we investigate the combined effects of impervious surfaces and domestic
   garden areas on pollinator richness. Due to the difficulty of accessing
   privately owned domestic gardens, we chose to use citizen science data
   from a well-established French citizen science program known as SPIPOLL.
   Using regression tree analysis on buffers located from 50m to 1000m
   around the data points, we show the importance of pollinators being in
   close proximity to domestic gardens as locally favorable habitats that
   are embedded within a landscape, in which impervious surfaces represent
   unfavorable areas. We highlight the inter-connection between local and
   landscape scales, the potential for patches of domestic gardens in

Abstract = {Long-term and widespread monitoring programs are essential to

   throughout the landscape, fragmentation of green space, and a loss of
   naturally occurring floral vegetation. All of these changes have a
   negative impact on pollinator diversity. The objective of this study was
   to assess the abundance and richness of wild bee species throughout a
   small city in northwest Pennsylvania and identify how management of land
   throughout the city may influence bee communities. Seventeen sites
   across a land use gradient, moving from areas with large open spaces and
   mainly permeable surfaces, to sites in the city center consisting of
   mainly impermeable surfaces, were sampled over a 2-year period. During
   this time, 106 known species were identified with four state records and
   1 undescribed species. Bee species richness was greatest at sites with
   the largest amount of permeable surface and naturally-occurring, native
   vegetation. Richness decreased on the college campus and city center
   where landscapes were highly managed and impermeable surfaces were most
   abundant. While floral richness was not related to bee abundance and
   richness, the number of open blooms near traps did have a positive
   impact on bee species richness. Overall, this survey revealed
   considerable richness never before recorded for northwest Pennsylvania,

Abstract = {Hedgerows, flowering strips, and natural areas that are adjacent to

   context of commercial- and residential-scale pollination-dependent crops
   up to 1000 m from garden study sites. We estimate that garden bees could
   forage outside of the garden in which they were collected, and that when
   pollination-dependent crops (commercial-scale or residential-scale) are
   nearby, 30-50\% of the garden bee community could potentially provide
   pollination services to adjacent crops, if urban bees readily cross
   boundaries and forage among habitat types. Urban gardens might thus be
   well-positioned to provision neighboring farms and food gardens with
   pollination services, or could serve as a refuge for pollinators when
   forage is scarce or crop management practices are inhospitable. The
   actual capacity of gardens to serve as a refuge for pollinators from
   agricultural fields depends upon the extent to which bees forage across
   habitat types. However, relatively little is known about the degree to
   which bees move among habitat patches in heterogeneous landscapes. We
   thus propose a research agenda that can document the extent to which
   gardens contribute to pollinator health and pollination services at the
   interface of urban, peri-urban, and rural landscapes. In particular,
   more data is needed on how landscape context impedes or promotes garden
   bee movement between habitat types.},

Abstract = {Google Street View and geospatial video mapping have been successfully
   employed to inventory neighborhood environments in a variety of
   disciplines, However, virtual survey approaches have yet to be leveraged
   fully for fine-scale auditing of ecological characteristics in urban
   contexts. Here we propose a method combining Google Street View and
   geospatial video mapping to virtually inventory vegetation composition
   over time in residential front yards to assess habitat for native
   pollinator conservation. As a proof of concept, it bolsters the
   feasibility and effectiveness of virtual approaches to conduct
   fine-scale street-level audits of neighborhood environments.
   Additionally, the findings inform future science-based education and
   outreach interventions at two study sites.},

Abstract = {The role of urban expansion on bee diversity is poorly understood, but
   it may play an important role in restructuring pollinator diversity
   observed in rural regions at the urban perimeter. We studied bee
   communities in two habitats essential for pollinators (residential
   gardens and semi-natural areas) at 42 sites situated at the edge of
   greater Montreal, Canada. Bee species richness, abundance and functional
   diversity all increased with urbanization in both habitat types, but
   gardens and semi-natural areas supported distinct bee communities with
   unique responses to urbanization in terms of species turnover. Compared
   to semi-natural sites, residential gardens supported bees that foraged
   from a greater number but a lower proportion of available plant species.
   Bees did not discriminate between exotic and indigenous plant species in
   either gardens or semi-natural sites and were attracted to flowers in
   either habitat irrespective of their origins. Protecting semi-natural
   ruderal areas and providing residential garden habitats for pollinators
   are both effective means of promoting regional bee diversity in
   urbanizing regions.},

Abstract = {Native grasses act as host plants, providing food and shelter, for
   numerous Lepidoptera species during their larval stage. As grassland
   habitat decreases because of conversion to agriculture and urban areas,
   prairie specialist butterflies and moths have also declined. Addition of
   native species to urban and agriculture landscapes has been shown to
   benefit Lepidoptera communities in various ways. Native grasses have
   grown in popularity as a landscaping plant due to their low nutrient
   requirements, drought tolerance, and soil stabilization properties.
   However, the benefits of native grasses to Lepidoptera are not well
   known to many entomologists or horticulturists, let alone the average
   consumer. We reviewed the literature that identified native prairie
   graminoids as host plants for native Lepidoptera in Minnesota,
   especially plants widely available in the horticultural trade that could
   be planted for restoration or landscaping purposes. The context of the
   Lepidoptera and host plant associations found in the literature are
   described. In total, we found 36 Lepidoptera species that used 17
   prairie graminoids as host plants cited in the literature. Three native
   grasses, Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash, Andropogon gerardii
   Vitman and Panicum virgatum L. and were found to be used by the most
   Lepidoptera species, 11, 9, and 8, respectively. Most likely there are
   additional moth species that use these grasses as host plants because
   butterfly species tend to be better documented than moth species. The
   specific larval habits and host plant species were unknown for many
   species of moths that feed or are suspected to feed on graminoids,
   showing the need for further research in this area. This information can
   assist horticulturalists, ecologists, landscape planners, land managers,
   and homeowners in their decisions to buy and plant native grass species.
   In general, this knowledge provides increased awareness about the larval
   life stage of butterflies and moths to concerned citizens and green
   industry and further supports the importance of conserving native
   prairie to support and maintain Lepidoptera species.},

Title = {Meteorological and landscape influences on pollen beetle immigration
   into oilseed rape crops},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {241},

Abstract = {Heavy reliance on pesticide inputs to maintain crop yields has been an
   important aspect of agricultural intensification. Insecticide use has
   had detrimental impacts on pollinators and natural pest control agents,
   contributing to a decline in associated ecosystem services, and has also
   led to resistance development in pest populations. Throughout Europe, in
   oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) crops, prophylactic use of insecticides
   against pollen beetles (Meligethes aeneus F. also known as
   Brassicogethes aeneus) has led to such issues, and there is an urgent
   need to develop more sustainable pest management practices for the crop.
   Although advice is available to oilseed rape growers regarding control
   thresholds, it may not be adhered to due to the expense of pollen beetle
   monitoring relative to the inexpensive cost of pyrethroid insecticides.
   Thus, the key to reducing prophylactic insecticide applications may lie
   with improved, less labour intensive methods of pollen beetle
   monitoring. For these to be realized, a better understanding is needed
   of the effects of agri-landscape features and meteorological conditions
   on pollen beetle immigration into the crop. In this study, based on data
   from four years of pollen beetle monitoring on a total of 41 field
   sites, we model the effects of meteorological (wind speed and direction,
   rainfall and accumulated temperature) and landscape (areas of woodland,
   residential gardens, the current and previous seasons' oilseed rape
   crops, and lengths of hedgerows and treelines) variables on directional
   sticky trap catches, at both the single trap and field scales.
   Meteorological variables, particularly accumulated temperature and wind
   speed were more important than landscape variables in predicting the
   abundance of pollen beetles immigrating into OSR fields. Sticky traps
   that were facing downwind caught more beetles than those that were
   facing across-wind or upwind; this is the first study to show at a
   landscape-scale, direct evidence for use of upwind anemotaxis by pollen
   beetles at the point of entry during immigration into the crop. At the
   field scale, the area of oilseed rape grown in the previous season was
   found to be positively related to trap catch, but no relationships with
   other landscape variables were found. Optimally-placed monitoring traps
   could complement existing decision support systems to reduce pollen
   beetle monitoring effort and encourage use of insecticides only when
   control thresholds are breached, thus enhancing the sustainability of
   oilseed rape production. Knowledge of the area of oilseed rape crops
   grown during the previous season in the surrounding landscape could
   contribute to risk assessment of potential pest pressure for individual
   OSR crops. (C) 2017 Rothamsted Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {BioLure, a synthetic food attractant for Mediterranean fruit fly
   {[}Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann)], is composed of three chemicals
   (ammonium acetate, trimethylamine hydrochloride, and putrescine). We
   deployed these components together and in separate MultiLure traps
   across predominantly native forests, non-native forests, farmlands,
   orchards, and residential areas on the islands of Hawaii and Maui, to
   evaluate attraction of C. capitata and nontarget insects. Large numbers
   (as many as 186 per trap per day) of mainly saprophagous nontarget flies
   (primarily Drosophilidae, Chloropidae, Lonchaeidae, Neriidae, Otitidae,
   and Calliphoridae) were attracted to BioLure. Very few predators,
   parasitoids, or pollinators were attracted. Native species,
   predominantly drosophilid and calliphorid flies, were attracted in large
   numbers in endemic forests, but mostly (at least 88\%) introduced
   species were collected in orchards, backyards, and non-native forest. A
   comparison of attraction to the three separate components versus
   combined components in traps revealed that ammonium acetate and, to a
   lesser extent, putrescine are the key components attractive to nontarget
   species. Omitting the putrescine ingredient from BioLure did not
   drastically decrease C. capitata catches but reduced nontarget captures
   by 20\%.},

Abstract = {Wild pollinators provide important services in both wild and
   human-dominated ecosystems, yet this group may be threatened by
   widespread anthropogenic landscape change. We explored the responses of
   wild bees to exotic floral species and novel habitat in a fragmented,
   suburban landscape, using pollen grain identification. Pollen loads from
   bee specimens collected in 13 suburban grassland fragments in Denver,
   Colorado were sampled and compared with a pollen reference collection.
   Averaged across two seasonal sampling rounds, 45\% of the bee-borne
   pollen grains were identified to the species level. Wild bees in this
   system were very receptive to using alien plants for pollen foraging, at
   least 45\% of pollen sampled from bee specimens consisted of non-native
   pollen grains. During peak flowering in early summer, bees obtained at
   least 32\% of their pollen resources from within-fragment sources and at
   least 7.5\% from surrounding suburban residential yards. In midsummer,
   within-fragment sources represented 58\% of pollen sampled while yards
   dropped to 1.5\%. These bees appear to be more accepting of exotic
   floral species than of exotic habitat types (yards). The advantages and
   disadvantages of pollen load analysis for movement studies are

   communities in a desert metropolis},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {209-218},
Abstract = {We compared the species richness and abundance of pollinator
   (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) communities in two seasons (September 1998 and
   April 1999) among four types of urban land use in the Phoenix, Arizona,
   USA, metropolitan area (xeriscaped residential yards, mesiscaped
   residential yards, urban desert-remnant parks, and natural desert parks
   on the fringe of the metropolitan area). Richness and abundance of bees
   were generally lower in residential areas than in desert areas, with
   desert areas on the fringe of the metro area possessing the highest
   diversity of all sites. Residential yards that utilized xeric
   landscaping had a more diverse bee community (with proportionally more
   rare species) than did mesic (turf grass) yards, particularly in late
   summer (September). Although bee community structure was apparently
   unaffected by the density of local habitat features (native and exotic
   trees, shrubs, cacti, and herbaceous plants in addition to human-built
   structures), the types of habitat features do appear to influence the
   number and types of bees present in an area. These results suggest that
   urban development can be designed to promote the conservation of bees.
   Specifically, preservation of desert and greater use of xeric
   landscaping rather than mesiscaping may help preserve this ecologically
   and economically vital group of organisms.},
