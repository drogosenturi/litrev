To address this knowledge gap, we investigated people's preferences for seeing wild mammals in residential areas by conducting and analyzing an online survey distributed across Germany (n = 2997 participants). Our results revealed that preferred species (squirrels, hedgehogs, hares, roe deer) were frequently encountered, whereas unpreferred species were those encountered frequently (rats, martens), as well as those encountered rarely (wild boar, coypus, raccoons). We also found a moderately positive correlation between the number of encounters with mammals and them being preferred by humans. Finally, some socio-demographic variables, particularly gender, garden access, and urbanity, are significantly related to human preferences. Based on our results, we propose tailoring wildlife management in residential areas to promote the positive attributes of preferred wildlife as biodiversity ambassadors, while also addressing ways to mitigate encounters and negative perceptions associated with unpreferred species.","10.5751/ES-15211-290306","1708-3087",NA,"Straka, Tanja/KCY-5691-2024 Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie/A-8778-2013",NA,"WOS:001273737600001","3",NA,"6",NA,NA,"The Good, the Bad, and the Unseen: Wild Mammal Encounters Influence Wildlife Preferences of Residents Across Socio-Demographic Gradients.",NA,NA,"selected"

Although garden ponds have novel biotic and abiotic characteristics, they are used by a variety of wildlife.

We addressed this knowledge gap using frogs as a case study taxon by investigating species assemblage, size (snout-vent length, SVL), body condition (scaled mass index, SMI), reproduction and recruitment in urban gardens with ponds relative to natural wetlands in southwestern Australia. Based on monthly sampling of 21 urban gardens and 6 wetlands between September 2023 and March 2024, we found that gardens supported a less diverse species assemblage than wetlands. Garden frogs were up to 39.5\% longer in SVL but did not differ in SMI to those in wetlands. Of species occurring in both habitats, 75\% (3) called earlier and/or for longer in gardens compared to wetlands. Over 40\% of garden ponds supported reproduction of motorbike frogs (Litoria moorei) and of these 45\% supported recently metamorphosed juveniles. Reproduction of the other species in gardens was minimal.

Understanding how wildlife interacts with humans and the built environment is critical as urbanization contributes to habitat change and fragmentation globally. The environmental drivers that influence HWIs are largely unknown in some systems, however, especially across multiple spatial scales. Using location and species data from a business that relocates snakes across the Phoenix metropolitan area (Arizona, USA), we found the most frequently removed were venomous (family Viperidae, e.g., rattlesnakes). Nonvenomous snakes were also removed (family Colubridae, e.g., gophersnakes). Using these records, we investigated taxa-specific habitat relationships at two spatial scales. The neighborhood scale focused on front yard measures of cover and vegetation classes, and the landscape scale focused on remote-sensed variables related to vegetation indices and degree of urbanization. Both analyses compared areas where snakes were removed to random locations in the city to evaluate used and available locations of snakes. At the neighborhood scale, snake removals (n = 59) occurred in yards with abundant vegetation and debris cover opportunities compared to random locations. At the landscape scale, snake removal locations (n = 764) had taxa-specific differences, with nonvenomous snakes removed from areas of higher urbanization than venomous snakes, a pattern was likely related to differences in life history and behavior. Environmental variables associated with HWI can vary across different spatial scales. Understanding these environmental characteristics associated with snake removals from residential can focus management activities to reduce potential human-snake conflict.","10.1007/s11252-024-01578-2","1083-8155","1573-1642",NA,"Bateman, Heather/0000-0002-3573-3824","WOS:001272653800002","6","JUL 2024",NA,NA,NA,"Beyond the Front Yard: Investigating Environmental Drivers of Residential Snake Removals Across Two Spatial Scales in a Desert City.",NA,NA,"excluded"

However, urban areas are also hotspots for rats, which negatively impact biodiversity due to competition and depredation. Urban residents may undertake rat control on their properties, but the effectiveness of such volunteer initiatives for broader biodiversity outcomes has not been tested in urban environments. We conducted a comprehensive study inclusive of rat abundance, adult bird diversity, and bird breeding success. We monitored rat (Norway rat Rattus norvegicus; ship rat Rattus rattus) presence and modelled detection probabilities and occupancy in suburban residential backyards in Auckland, New Zealand. We also compared bird abundance and richness among backyards and recorded 140 nesting attempts from 15 bird species between September 2021 and February 2022. Despite rat control, rats were detected at some point in all backyards, though relative abundance was low, and fewer rats were detected in backyards with more frequent rat control. Higher bird abundance, and to a lesser extent richness, were associated with proximity to native vegetation patches and more frequent rat control. Overall fledging success was relatively high and predation by rats was relatively low compared to previous research. Nest survival was slightly higher for introduced bird species. Daily nest survival rate increased with nest height, proximity to native vegetation patches, and when rat detection rates decreased. Although the effect was small, frequent rat control within a backyard was associated with increased fledging success and increased bird species richness and abundance. Further research is required to explore the factors that interact with backyard rat control to improve local outcomes for birds. High levels of community participation in backyard rat control are required to improve neighbourhood-wide outcomes for birds.","10.1007/s10530-024-03401-7","1387-3547","1573-1464","Gerolemou, Rosie/LQK-2348-2024 Stanley, Margaret/F-2580-2011","/0000-0001-8376-541X Stanley, Margaret/0000-0003-0701-8935","WOS:001278324000002","11","JUL 2024",NA,NA,NA,"Outcomes of Community-Led Urban Rat Control on Avifauna.",NA,NA,"excluded"
"X.WOS.001382541900002","article","Newton, Ian","Learning and social influence on bird migration","ARDEA","2024","112","171-199","NOV","Several aspects of the migratory behaviour of birds, notably timing, direction and duration, have been shown, mainly from breeding experiments, to be under genetic influence. Nevertheless, aspects of migratory behaviour can be improved by learning, either from personal experience or from other individuals. This review is concerned with social influence on different aspects of bird migration. Communal migration can provide not only the usual anti-predation and food-finding benefits, but also energy savings (resulting from particular flock structures), greater synchronization of individual journeys and improved route finding. Individuals in a group can pool their knowledge of directions and routes to mutual benefit, and if a group contains different age-groups, na \& iuml;ve youngsters can learn from more experienced individuals. These advantages may be one reason why many birds migrate in flocks or in more diffuse aggregations, even some species that normally live solitarily. Some species, notably swans, geese and cranes, migrate as family units within flocks, so young could learn migratory routes, stopover sites and wintering areas from their parents. And providing the two age-groups migrated together, the young of other species could learn the same details from older, more experienced individuals, whether related or not. In the daytime, some birds can be seen to migrate on their own, while others travel in groups, flocks or other looser assemblages. Night migration has been studied by radar, ceilometers and other artificial lights and by `moon-watching', as well as by sound recording to detect flight calls. While some species travel at night in dense flocks, as in the daytime, others (including some solitary species) seem to travel in loose aggregations which may form once the birds are airborne. Calling maintains contact between individuals and may thereby provide information on optimal directions, flight altitudes and other aspects. Species vary in the extent to which they call at night, but such vocalizations increase at times of change, such as take-offs and landings, altitude changes or as birds enter mist. Many birds show specific behaviours before migration which serve to synchronize departures of those individuals which have reached an appropriate condition. Individual homing pigeons, released at a distance, can normally find their way back to their home loft, but different pigeons may develop different routes. When pairs of pigeons, which have developed different routes, are released together, they may either take an intermediate route or one pigeon may join the other regarded as `leader'. The larger the difference in experience between two pigeons, the greater the likelihood that the more experienced bird will emerge as leader. Migration in flocks may improve the accuracy of orientation if the direction of the flock is an average of the headings of the individual flock members (the `many wrongs' principle). This notion has been supported by experiments on homing pigeons, and also by observations of wild birds, in which single individuals or small groups showed more variation in their directions than did larger groups. In general, directional scatter decreased as group size increased. In such systems, individual birds benefit from social contact with others, but all individuals have equal influence on the resulting direction. In practice, some birds (leaders) are likely to have more influence on directions than others (experienced more than inexperienced), as shown in experiments with pigeons and tracking of wild goose families on migration. Large scale field experiments have also shown that birds can be influenced in their movements by others of their species, and that even birds from resident populations can sometimes be induced to migrate when released into areas where migrants prevail. When juveniles are released in the absence of experienced adults, they take a wider range of directions than normal, some of which take them off an optimal route. By training geese, swans or cranes to fly behind ultralight aircraft, new migration routes have been created, re-establishing migratory populations in areas from which they were eliminated in the past. Such experiments further illustrate the role of social influence on bird migratory patterns. Suggestions are made for further research aimed to fill gaps in understanding and to take forward our understanding of social influence on migratory behaviour.","10.5253/arde.2024.a8","0373-2266","2213-1175",NA,NA,"WOS:001382541900002","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Learning and Social Influence on Bird Migration.",NA,NA,"excluded"

One project analysed the ant fauna found in 20 gardens and lawns in small to very small properties (these having a bungalow or duplex (semi-detached) as the main residential building, and a lawn or garden area of 43 m(2)-332 m(2)) east, south, north and west of the Central Business District (CBD). The other project examined the ant fauna at 14 sites, principally in native regrowth along the Kwinana Freeway, a major artery that runs north to south through Perth's suburbs. The gardens and lawns produced a very depauperate fauna of 26 ant species, of which a maximum of 20 were native and at least six species were exotic. The ant fauna from regrowth adjacent to the Kwinana Freeway and at two additional sites (one a bush control) was more than twice as rich, the 56 species collected including only two exotics. In the garden project, ant richness, evenness and abundance were not significantly correlated with size of the garden area. The same applied even when the exotic Pheidole megacephala-dominated gardens were removed from the analysis. Ordination analysis combining the two sets of data revealed a distinct clustering of most of the regrowth sites, whereas the bush control stood alone and garden or lawn sites exhibited a much looser pattern of association. We suggest that increasing the density of Perth suburbs is resulting in drastic loss of native invertebrate fauna, of which ants are a useful bioindicator. However, native vegetation regrowth along major arterial roads could act as a reservoir for invertebrate species that might otherwise disappear entirely from the Perth metropolitan area.","10.1007/s11252-012-0257-0","1083-8155","1573-1642",NA,NA,"WOS:000318444400001","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Urbanisation Factors Impacting on Ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Biodiversity in the Perth Metropolitan Area, Western Australia: Two Case Studies.",NA,NA,"excluded"

However, limited empirical research has explored why people are motivated to keep chickens in their backyard. This paper analyses qualitative interviews undertaken in Australia to explore what motivated people to keep backyard chickens and their experiences. Thematic analysis of interviews involving 44 participants showed that backyard chickens had considerable utility value by providing eggs for food (but interestingly not meat), recycling food scraps, and educating children about where food comes from and how to care for animals. Participants also described chickens as having pet-like characteristics, with many articulating considerable details about the personalities of their birds and how they provide companionship. However, chickens are not afforded the same privileges as other domestic pets such as cats and dogs: for instance, participants stated that they would not seek veterinary advice should their chickens have symptoms of illness, nor do they allow them to come inside the home. We argue that chickens assume a liminal place on the human-animal relations spectrum, where they occupy a position that is simultaneously in both the affect and the utility categories. With the continued growth in backyard chickens, which are associated with concerns about the food supply due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related issues, together with increasing concerns about biosecurity, developing a more robust account of the complex roles they play and the relationships we have with them are critical for our understandings of ethical and related food choices in urban settings and the efficacy of possible policy interventions related to food supply.","10.1080/08927936.2024.2418698","0892-7936","1753-0377","Buddle, Emily/AGV-2392-2022 ","Buddle, Emily/0000-0001-7073-5588 Bray, Heather/0000-0002-9435-8876","WOS:001349124500001",NA,"NOV 2024",NA,NA,NA,"The Chicken for the Egg: Australian Motivations for Raising Backyard Chickens.",NA,NA,"excluded"

As conversion of natural areas to human development continues, there is a lack of information about how developed areas can sustainably support wildlife. While large predators are often extirpated from areas of human development, some medium-bodied mammalian predators (hereafter, mesocarnivores) have adapted to co-exist in human-dominated areas. Aims. How human-dominated areas such as residential yards are used by mesocarnivores is not well understood. Our study aimed to identify yard and landscape features that influence occupancy, relative abundance and spatial-temporal overlap of three widespread mesocarnivores, namely, coyote (Canis latrans), grey fox (Urocyon cineroargenteus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Methods Over the summers of 2021 and 2022, we deployed camera-traps in 46 and 96 residential yards, spanning from low-density rural areas (<1 home per km2) to more urban areas (589 homes per km2) in north-western Arkansas, USA. Key results. We found that mesocarnivore occupancy was marginally influenced by yard-level features as opposed to landscape composition. Fences reduced the occupancy probability of coyotes, although they were positively associated with the total area of potential shelter sites in a yard. We found that relative abundance of grey fox was highest in yards with poultry, highlighting a likely source of conflict with homeowners. We found that all three species were primarily nocturnal and activity overlap between the species pairs was high. Conclusions Thus, these species may be using spatio-temporal partitioning to avoid antagonistic encounters and our data supported this, with few examples of species occurring in the same yards during the same 24-h period. Implications. As the number of residential yards continues to grow, our results suggested that there are ways in which our yards can provide resources to mesocarnivores and that homeowners also have agency to mitigate overlap with mesocarnivores through management of their yard features.","10.1071/WR23065","1035-3712","1448-5494",NA,NA,"WOS:001321163600001","10",NA,"WR23065",NA,NA,"Mesocarnivores in Residential Yards: Influence of Yard Features on the Occupancy, Relative Abundance, and Overlap of Coyotes, Grey Fox, and Red Fox.",NA,NA,"excluded"

To offer an informed basis to improve Human-Wolf coexistence, we explore how socio-demographic factors, fear, knowledge, and perceptions of costs and benefits of wolf presence drive human attitudes in the southern area of the Douro River, Portugal, a region inhabited by a small and endangered wolf population. We interviewed 220 people (175 from the general public, 13 hunters, and 32 livestock owners) through a semi-structured survey organized on a 5-point Likert scale. Public and hunter respondents exhibited neutral to positive attitudes, whereas livestock owners expressed negative to neutral attitudes and revealed a Not-In-My-Backyard sentiment. We found that positive attitudes were linked to a greater receptiveness to increased wolf numbers, particularly in areas of irregular wolf presence. Fear was a significant driver of public attitudes, while the presence of wolves influenced livestock owners'views. For both groups, attitudes were also influenced by perceived costs and benefits. Knowledge about wolves did not significantly influence attitudes, with scores being consistently low across groups, and the myth of reintroduction persisting. Thus, management actions should address the concerns and complaints of individuals directly affected by wolves, dispel common fears and myths, and emphasize the ecological and economic benefits of wolf presence in the territory. Media outlets can serve as strategic partners in engaging the neutral population through untargeted interventions. Prioritizing the input of all groups, including conservationists, is essential for establishing common ground and ensuring sustained coexistence.","10.1007/s10745-024-00526-0","0300-7839","1572-9915","Carvalho, JoÃ£o/V-4043-2018 Fonseca, Carlos/D-9744-2011 Rosalino, Luis Miguel/B-9406-2009","Lino, Sofia/0000-0002-6428-4845 Fonseca, Carlos/0000-0001-6559-7133 Rosalino, Luis Miguel/0000-0003-4186-7332","WOS:001285687800001","4","AUG 2024",NA,NA,NA,"Avenues for Coexistence: How Perception of Costs and Benefits Shape Attitudes Towards Wolves.",NA,NA,"selected"

Public perceptions, values and socio-cultural drivers in a designed garden setting","URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING","2021","65",NA,"NOV","The global climate crisis precipitates a call to `futureproof' cities by introducing resilient climate-adapted urban green infrastructure (UGI). Recent UK research has revealed public support for climate-adapted UGI, yet there is a lack of research focusing on the values underlying public perceptions, particularly in relation to climate change, and the socio-cultural factors driving these. This was addressed by asking 249 people to walk through one of three contrasting areas of planting: exotic (climate-adapted); traditional or cottage-garden, within a designed garden setting, whilst conducting a self-guided questionnaire assessing participants' perceptions of aesthetics, self-reported restorative effect, and plant and invertebrate biodiversity. Participants' held values in relation to climate change, non-native species, and nature-connectedness were also addressed. Findings indicated aesthetic preference for climate-adapted planting over the other two styles, providing further evidence of cultural acceptance for policymakers and land-managers seeking to `futureproof' cities by introducing climate-adapted UGI. Planting of a cottage-garden style was perceived as the least attractive, but the most restorative.

Urban community gardens are social-ecological systems that support biodiversity, ecosystem services, and positive humannature interactions. In turn, community gardens can provide ideal ``real-world labs{''} to co-create, test, and collectively implement biodiversity conservation strategies with gardeners that can be transferred to and mainstreamed across other urban ecosystems. This is important because the impact of biodiversity-friendly gardening strategies is not yet systematically researched, nor how this knowledge can be transferred to other urban ecosystems. In our transdisciplinary research, we are developing, implementing, and testing biodiversity conservation interventions focused on promoting insect diversity with gardeners and neighborhood residents from Berlin and Munich, Germany. Our aim is to engage with and support city residents in biodiversity-based urban greening. To do so, we work at the nexus between civil society (gardeners, neighborhood residents, ecologically oriented organizations) and relevant city actors (city council, district committees, city administration) to anchor the participation of civil society in the ecological transformation of the city. In this communication article, we present our transdisciplinary research concept, participatory methods, and experience thus far in translating research to practice, and supporting the role of city residents to implement biodiversity interventions in their gardens and in their neighborhoods.","10.1016/j.ufug.2024.128481","1618-8667","1610-8167",NA,NA,"WOS:001294946700001",NA,"AUG 2024","128481",NA,NA,"Growing Gardens into Neighborhoods Through Transdisciplinary Research.",NA,NA,"excluded"

The scale of management can affect environmental heterogeneity and thus can affect biodiversity at alpha, beta, and gamma scales. Urban areas provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of large- versus small-scale land management on different scales of biodiversity. We surveyed floral resources and bees in residential backyards and powerline corridors in the Chicago suburbs, with yards representing small-scale management and powerline corridors representing large-scale management. We calculated alpha diversity, beta diversity, and gamma diversity for both floral and bee species. We also determined absolute nestedness for corridors and neighborhoods to gain further insight into effects of management on species composition. We found that beta diversity for both floral resources and bees was highest in response to small-scale yard management and its creation of heterogeneous landscapes, while alpha and gamma diversity patterns were less clear. We also found that the floral resource and bee communities demonstrated absolute nestedness in both powerline corridors and residential neighborhoods, respectively. Our results indicate that taxa may respond to the effects of management scale differently owing to variation in their mobility or resource requirements. Our study results demonstrate that suburban residential areas may be prime targets for biodiversity conservation due to their environmental heterogeneity.","10.1007/s10531-024-02954-2","0960-3115","1572-9710",NA,NA,"WOS:001355309200001",NA,"NOV 2024",NA,NA,NA,"Management Scale Drives Bee and Forb Biodiversity Patterns in Suburban Green Spaces.",NA,NA,"excluded"

Sedentary grazers can be numerous in fresh waters, despite the constraints on resource availability and the increased predation risk inherent in this lifestyle. The retreats of sedentary grazers have been assumed to provide protection to the resident (a house), but also may provide additional fertilised food for the grazer (i.e. a garden). If retreats function as a garden, then they should (i) contain a higher quality and/or quantity of food than the alternative food source. Furthermore, the proportion of retreat-derived carbon and nitrogen assimilated by the resident should be (ii) related to overall resource availability (more when resources are limited) or (iii) perhaps also to larval density. Alternatively, if retreats provide a less risky food source, then (iv) assimilation of material from the retreat is likely to be greater under conditions in which the risk of emerging from the retreat is high. 2. We tested these four hypotheses for the common and widespread gallery-building grazing caddisfly Tinodes waeneri. Resource availability, larval density and biomass, and exposure were measured for populations from six lakes of differing productivity in August, October and January. 3. Galleries always contained more algal food than the surrounding epilithon, suggesting that gardening is effective. Furthermore, gallery chlorophyll a content in August, and the disparity in food quality (assessed from the C : N ratio) between gallery and epilithon (quality higher in the former) in October were positively related to the proportion of larval biomass that was derived from the gallery. Larval density and wave exposure parameters were not related to larval assimilation of gallery material. 4. Galleries that are fertilised by the occupant provide more, and sometimes also better quality, food (in terms of the C : N ratio) than is otherwise available. Thus, the gallery plays a substantial role in larval nutrition, and this role is greater at key times of food shortage.","10.1111/fwb.12025","0046-5070","1365-2427","Grey, Jonathan/B-3346-2012 ","Grey, Jonathan/0000-0001-9069-2271","WOS:000310346900009","12",NA,NA,NA,NA,"House and Garden': Larval Galleries Enhance Resource Availability for a Sedentary Caddisfly.",NA,NA,"excluded"

Despite substantial investigations on the contribution to connectivity of different types of urban green spaces, the specific contribution of green spaces located in multifamily residential (MFR) plots has yet to be assessed. Estimating this contribution is crucial given the multiple roles fulfilled by these green spaces in urban planning. To achieve this goal, we focused on four taxa: the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), the Red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), forest passerine birds and moths. We assessed the potential habitat connectivity for each taxon across the metropolitan urban area of Lyon (France), with landscape graphs built using 1-metre resolution land cover maps. Considering the current state as a reference, we then designed five land cover change scenarios affecting habitat distribution in the MFR plots: (i) maximum and (ii) minimum theoretical connectivity (references), (iii) improve quality of existing green spaces, (iv) improve quantity of green spaces with sub-optimal quality and, (v) maximum restoration (management scenarios). The taxon- and scenario-specific impacts highlight the crucial contribution of private spaces to habitat connectivity. For all taxa, while the MFR only cover 8 \% of the study area, connectivity would increase by up to 60\% if these plots were greened. In contrast, sealing these plots could reduce overall connectivity by up to 40 \%. The interpolation of local connectivity metrics for each habitat patch and each MFR plot allowed us to identify the most relevant plots for urban greening. Because our approach can improve habitat connectivity at different scales, from neighbourhoods to entire urban areas, it could prove useful for landscape planning in most urban settings.","10.1016/j.ufug.2024.128471","1618-8667","1610-8167",NA,NA,"WOS:001289568800001",NA,"AUG 2024","128471",NA,NA,"Assessing the Strategic Role of Urban Green Spaces for Habitat Connectivity in Multi-Family Residential Plots.",NA,NA,"excluded"

In this study, we randomly selected properties in two counties in southwestern Ohio along two gradients: parcel size and parcel valuation (as proxies for urbanization and income gradients, respectively). Two hundred surveys were deployed asking residents about their yard management practices, and their willingness to plant three pollinator beneficial plants (Asclepias syriaca, Echinacea purpurea, and wildflowers (multiple spp.)). One hundred and thirteen surveys were returned (57\% response rate). For residents who did not have the aforementioned plants in their yards at the time of the survey, i.e. nearly two-thirds of the respondents, we used random forest models to uncover determinants of willingness to add the native plants shown in the survey in residential yards. Overall, this subpopulation is unwilling to add the plants shown in the survey, especially if they like to keep their backyards neat and tidy. However, differences exist regarding the key explanatory variables of the willingness to plant A. syriaca compared to the other plant types shown in the survey. For A. syriaca property value is not an important explanatory variable but not growing hay and enjoying mowing are associated with stronger willingness to plant A syriaca. For the other native plant types, lower income residents were the least willing to plant them suggesting they might not have the capacity to do so and/or are strongly wanting to adhere to traditional yard aesthetics. The highest income residents were also less willing to add these plants. These findings suggest that approaching homeowners to convert land to native plants should take different tacks for different native plants. For example, to attempt to convince midwestern residents to plant A. syriaca, we suggest focusing on more rural households and properties where hay is not grown. Together, our results indicate that this coupled human-natural system is strongly influenced by a variety of variables that support the ``ecology of prestige{''} theory (Grove et al., 2014) and that the potential for voluntarily erecting pollinator beneficial plantings on private lands where they are currently absent might be rather limited.","10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122852","0301-4797","1095-8630",NA,NA,"WOS:001335138200001",NA,"OCT 2024","122852",NA,NA,"Determinants of Willingness to Add Pollinator Beneficial Plants to Residential Yards Differ by Plant Type.",NA,NA,"selected"
