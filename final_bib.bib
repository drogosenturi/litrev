	abstract = {Human dimensions research can help resource and wildlife managers make informed decisions, target information efforts, and gain a greater understanding of the factors that comprise attitudes toward wildlife management efforts. Despite these often-stated merits, studies addressing the human dimensions of resource and wildlife management efforts are rare in Europe. A proposed restoration of free-ranging European bison (Bison bonasus) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, has presented an opportunity to help address this research gap. During May to July 2006, we used a randomly distributed, self-administered questionnaire (n = 398) to assess local residents’ attitudes, beliefs, and levels of support or opposition toward the proposed restoration. These factors were compared across two administrative regions spanned by the proposed restoration area. We found that respondents from the Siegen-Wittgenstein region held significantly more positive attitudes and significantly higher knowledge levels than respondents from the Hochsauerlandkreis region. Principal components analysis revealed that attitudes comprised a general attitude factor pertaining to issues such as the importance of conserving bison for future generations and a lifestyle impact factor, which included items pertaining to bison-caused damages to trees and crops. Logistic regression was used to show the influence of fear of bison on attitudes. We discuss the likely causes and management implications of our findings and provide suggestions to managers wishing to target information efforts and address the concerns of those affected by the proposed restoration.},

	abstract = {Human–wildlife interactions are believed to be increasing worldwide, and a number of studies have analyzed the risks posed by larger carnivores. However, people can also perceive smaller species of carnivores as threatening, particularly in urban areas. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) started to colonize British cities in the 1930s, and there is growing public concern about foxes biting people, particularly babies. These events are generally described in the press as attacks and generate intense media coverage and speculation that foxes view human infants as potential prey. Because foxes rely primarily on auditory cues for hunting, we conducted acoustic playback experiments in the gardens of 15 residential houses in northwest Bristol, United Kingdom, in December 2015 and 11 gardens from May to June 2016 to determine whether urban foxes were attracted to infant distress calls (cries). Foxes were not more likely to be attracted to infant cries or laughs than silence, although a minority of foxes cautiously approached and contacted the source of both types of infant vocalization. Their behavior appeared to be investigative rather than aggressive or predatory. Our review of the incidents reported in the British media showed that most people were bitten or scratched while sleeping, and adults were more likely to be bitten than children. The nature of the interactions and the wounds inflicted suggest that the foxes were using their mouth or forefeet to investigate an unusual object. Most incidents occurred inside people’s homes, even though it is unusual for foxes to enter houses. The data suggested that incidents where people were bitten were chance events, possibly involving a particularly bold fox. To minimize the risk to the public, more quantitative data are required on the age, social status, and health of the foxes that enter houses and those that bite people.},

	abstract = {Stimulated by animal-welfare concerns, community programs to ``rescue\{''\} urban wildlife generate many interactions between humans and wildlife. Such rescue activities (1) may have direct ecological effects (by modifying mortality patterns of wildlife, or geographic distributions at the local level), and (2) may provide valuable information on local abundance and distribution of taxa, the nature of threats to urban wildlife, and biological attributes of poorly-known species. We examine these issues for reptiles rescued by community-based animal-welfare groups in south-eastern Australia. Records gathered by the Wildlife Information and Rescue Service over a 10-year period (1989-1998) in New South Wales quantify rates, determinants and outcomes of reptile rescues. Despite their scarcity in urban habitats, snakes (11,067 records) were represented almost as often as lizards (11,108). Typically, rescued lizards were large in size or snake-like in appearance. Most reptiles (especially snakes) were rescued not because of injury, but because the local residents wanted them removed. Thus, very large numbers of these animals were translocated to release sites. Of the injured animals, small-bodied reptile species (and juveniles of larger species) were frequent victims of attacks by domestic cats and dogs. Larger reptiles were more often injured by motor vehicles. Capture rates for all species were highest in warmer months, and especially on days with dry, warm weather. These temporal patterns seem to be due to reptile biology not human behaviour. The rapid increase in animal-rescue activities indicates that potential ecological effects (especially, arising from translocation of ``problem\{''\} wildlife) deserve further study. At the same time, such community groups can provide valuable information for ecologists. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Urbanization is recognized as one of the greatest threats to biodiversity throughout the world. However, the vegetation within an urbanized landscape is diverse and includes a variety of native and exotic plant species. This variation allows for testing whether certain landscape designs outperform others in the support of native biodiversity. Residential yards represent a large component of an urban landscape and, if managed collectively for birds and other wildlife, could offset some of the negative effects of urbanization. In addition, many urbanites have their primary interaction with the natural world in their front and back yards. Therefore, ensuring positive wildlife experiences for them is essential in promoting urban biodiversity. At the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research site we tested the efficacy of native landscaping in residential yards in attracting native birds. We also explored the links between socioeconomic factors, landscape designs, and urban gradient measurements with the urban bird communities. A redundancy analysis suggested that native desert bird species increased in abundance in neighborhoods with desert landscaping designs, neighborhoods closer to large desert tracts, and higher-income neighborhoods. Variance partitioning showed that collectively these three sets of environmental variables explained almost 50{\textbackslash}\% of the variation in the urban bird community. Results suggested racial and economic inequities in access to biodiversity, whereby predominantly Hispanic and lower-income neighborhoods had fewer native birds. We also found that residents' satisfaction with bird diversity was positively correlated with actual bird diversity. Our study provides new insights into the relative importance of socioeconomic variables and common urban ecological measurements in explaining urban bird communities. Urban planners can use this information to develop residential landscapes that support the well-being of both birds and people.},

A total of 172 surveys (57{\textbackslash}\%) were returned, producing 768 records of 83 fauna species, dominated by birds and mammals; bandicoots were widely reported from the 38 fragments. Several historical records provided evidence of recent local extinctions within fragments, highlighting the continuing declines in various species of native wildlife within Brisbane. Several human-wildlife conflicts were identified, but overall residents were tolerant of such conflicts. Bandicoots were disliked by a small minority (3{\textbackslash}\%) of residents owing to the holes they dig in lawns and gardens in search of food. and their potential as vectors of ticks. Most respondents expressed ail appreciation for the presence of native wildlife (96{\textbackslash}\%) and bushland fragments (97{\textbackslash}\%) in their local area, emphasising the importance of incorporating human dimension values into the management of this urban biodiversity.},

On the basis of the results of this study, it is to be expected that radical solutions such as killing the foxes are unlikely to be accepted among the population. Worming of the foxes does, however, meet with general approval.},

These costs increase as conservation efforts lead to recovery of animal populations, and human population growth increases the proportion of land outside the parks used for agriculture. Financial and social costs associated with crop raiding were studied in 25 villages around Kibale National Park, Uganda. Perceptions about crop raiding were collected using focus groups and household surveys, while damage was evaluated based on physical monitoring of crop raiding incidents. The average financial loss for farmers around the park over six months was US{\textbackslash}\$74 (1.5{\textbackslash}\% of median household capital asset wealth) and damage was particularly high within 0.5 km of the park boundary. Households experiencing crop raiding were more prone to food insecurity, and higher rates of self-reported human and livestock diseases, while children from villages bordering the park tended to have poorer scholastic achievement. Compensation is not affordable for the wildlife authority, nor is it sustainable as crop raiding is escalating. To mitigate costs for local communities, funding has been justified for the implementation of crop raiding defenses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Context As urbanisation continues to increase on a global scale, people are becoming increasingly distanced from nature. Fewer opportunities to encounter nature mean that the benefits of engaging with nature are often not realised by urban residents. In response to this, there is a growing number of initiatives that aim to connect people with nature, for the benefit of individuals, communities and nature conservation. However, in order to maximise these benefits, it is important to understand the potential transformative effects for participants, both on a personal level and in terms of wider impacts. Aims In this study, we evaluate the social outcomes of a participatory wildlife conservation project in an urban area in north-east England, using hedgehogs as the focal species. Methods Based on an approach of community volunteers working alongside scientific researchers in an evaluation of hedgehog urban habitat use, we examine the transformative effects of this involvement at the individual and community levels via qualitative semi-structured interviews with community volunteers. Key results Participants were motivated by personal wellbeing factors such as enjoying proximity to the study species, learning and social factors. Participation in the study itself indicates a degree of motivation for engaging with a study of this sort. Nevertheless, involvement in the study was a successful vehicle for increasing participants' engagement with nature both during the study and potentially into the future, particularly in terms of biological recording and gardening for wildlife. Conclusions Participation in a wildlife study is a positive experience for many volunteers, leading to actual and potential changes in both personal and wider social outcomes. Implications Participatory initiatives such as the one described have an important role to play in signposting and supporting volunteers to follow future environmental aspirations and maximise the personal and social benefits associated with participation. This could be enhanced by ensuring that volunteering opportunities are linked in with pre-existing community-based networks that can act as advocates for environmental and wildlife conservation.},

	abstract = {Human-wildlife conflict is increasing as urbanization expands and wildlife species adjust to living near people. Translocation is often used to manage human-wildlife conflict because it is considered to be humane, yet fates of translocated animals are largely unknown. As an urban adapter, woodchucks (Marmota monax) are a common source of human-wildlife conflict due to their burrowing, foraging, and scent-marking behavior. We examined survival and movements of 27 nuisance woodchucks captured by a nuisance wildlife operator in the Chicago metropolitan area, radiomarked with internal transmitters, and translocated to exurban release sites mimicking typical practices. We also captured and radiomarked 16 resident woodchucks from the release landscape for comparison. Translocated woodchucks moved farther than residents immediately post release with no evidence of homing and most left the release site. Annual survival did not differ between translocated and resident woodchucks. However, survival was extremely low (0.18) compared to previous estimates for woodchucks, primarily due to high predation by coyotes (Canis latrans). Translocation should be used only when other nonlethal methods are ineffective (e.g., exclusion, removing food sources, selecting unpalatable plants for gardens). When necessary, the practice of translocation could be improved by reducing predation risk for translocated animals, either by selecting release sites with low predation risk, or by using soft-release methods, such as acclimation enclosures or artificial burrows.},

Wildlife-friendly gardening is influenced by a combination of garden characteristics and management intensity, householder demographics, wider environmental activity and landscape context. Residents reveal a range of motivations for wildlife-friendly gardening, notably personal well-being and a moral responsibility to nature. Respondents expressed a duty to maintain neighbourhood standards, revealing that social norms are a considerable barrier to uptake of wildlife-friendly activities, but also provide an opportunity where neighbour mimicry results in diffusion of wildlife-friendly practices.

The erosion of cultural beliefs and practices can have adverse, often severe, consequences for biodiversity. We explored the relationships among informal institutions, religion, and human attitudes toward sacred populations of a threatened, endemic species, Sclater's monkey (Cercopithecus sclateri), in two communities in southeastern Nigeria. Due to habitat loss and hunting pressure across the species' range, monkeys in these two sites live alongside people, raid farms and gardens, and are commonly viewed as pests. Using structured (n = 410) and semi-structured (n = 21) interviews, we examined factors influencing residents' views of the monkeys, mechanisms affecting adherence to social taboos against harming monkeys, and implications for conservation. Our analyses revealed that most residents, particularly those from one community, women, and farmers, held negative opinions of the monkeys. Crop and garden raiding by monkeys had the most adverse effect on people's attitudes. Although the adoption of Christianity weakened residents' views regarding the no-killing taboos, continued adherence to the taboos was particularly influenced by supernatural retribution in one site and community disapproval in the other. Only one community widely conferred symbolic importance on the monkeys. Such site differences illustrate the value of local cultural understanding in conservation. Pre-intervention studies of this nature allow for the development of locally and culturally sensitive conservation programs, as well as better-informed assessments of what interventions are most likely to be effective.},

The ecological characteristics of residential areas are largely determined by the decisions of many individual ``managers.\{''\} In these complex socio-ecological systems, it is important to understand the factors that motivate human decision-making. Objectives Our first objective was to quantify wildlife resources and management activities in residential landscapes and compare vegetation in front and back yards. Our second objective was to test three hypotheses linked with variation in yards: socioeconomic characteristics, neighborhood design factors, and perceptions of neighborhood birds. Methods We conducted surveys of over 900 residents in 25 Chicago-area neighborhoods to examine the wildlife resources contained in front and back yards and the social factors associated with variation in yards. We used a multi-scalar approach to examine among-yard and among-neighborhood variation in residential landscapes. Results Results indicate that back yards contain more wildlife resources than front yards, including greater vegetation complexity, more plants with fruit/berries, and more plants intended to attract birds. Furthermore, different hypotheses explain variation in front and back yards. Perceptions of birds were most important in explaining variation in back yard vegetation and wildlife-friendly resources per parcel, while neighbors' yards and socioeconomic characteristics best explained front yard vegetation. Conclusions This study demonstrates the importance of back yards as an unexplored and underestimated resource for biodiversity. In addition, the results provide insight into the complex factors linked with yard decisions, notably that residents' connections with neighborhood birds appear to translate to on-the-ground actions.},

	abstract = {The conflict between humans and wild animals is a special type of phenomena between human development and wild animal conservation, not only leading to massive economic loss to local residents, but also imposing severe impacts upon the production and living activities and even personal safety of the residents. Human-elephant conflict has existed as a phenomenon of human settlement development for more than 20 years in Xishuangbanna, China. There are periodic incidents of wild elephants hurting/killing people as well as feeding on and destroying subsistence and cash crops. It is an increasingly urgent and important issue for China to resolve while protecting and managing Asian elephants. Our study employed an Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis model to perform a risk assessment of areas where the Asian elephant currently is distributed and to predict future risks. It employed a Circuit Theory model based on random walk theory to predict multiple potential movement or migration pathways of Asian elephants within Xishuangbanna. The results indicated that: (1) the regions with human-elephant conflict risk in Xishuangbanna Prefecture had an area of about 4349.08 km(2), accounting for 22.77{\textbackslash}\% of the total prefecture area, with the risk regions primarily present in the middle and north parts of Menghai County and Jinghong City and in Mengla County in which there was a wide geographical distribution covering from the south to the north; (2) The regions of agriculture and garden that were close to Asian elephant distribution and roads were likely occurring risk; (3) There were more potential movement paths of elephants within Mengyang and Menghai distribution regions, which indicated that the connection of these areas was better. While the potential movement paths of elephants within Mengla and Shangyong were little; (4) There were some potential movement paths between different distribution areas of Asian elephant, but the migration possibility of elephants in different distribution areas was decreasing due to natural barriers (Mengyang-Menghai has Lancang river) and discontinuous potential paths between Mengla and Shangyong. Additionally, we discussed that created ecological corridors between different natural reserves to allow more dispersal and gene flow of elephants and diminish conflict between human and elephant. We also put forward compensation suggestions in different risk area. We hope our analytical methods can be applied, improved and expanded to other areas with similar wildlife damage.

Suburban gardens may serve as refugia and foraging grounds for many primate species allowing them to populate within a largely urbanized landscape. However, this has led to the increasing human interactions with them, resulting in conflict. Our study investigated the perceptions of suburban residents towards urban vervet monkeys Cercopithecus aethiops pygerythrus within the Msunduzi and Ethekwini municipalities, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We assessed how these related to the monkeys' presence, activities and interactions in residential gardens, and the value of wildlife to residents. Assessment was conducted through an online questionnaire survey. General attitudes of residents to vervet monkeys were canvassed by assessing the respondents' level of active engagement in wildlife watching within their properties. We analyzed 603 surveys submitted online using logistic regression and ordinal regression models. We ascertained that vervet monkeys were disliked by 29{\textbackslash}\% of residents due to their aggressiveness, destructive behaviour in gardens and households, and perceived threat to native wildlife. Frequency and duration of foraging vervet monkeys in residents' gardens was influenced by the presence of pet dogs, fruiting trees, tall trees ({\textgreater} 2 m), ratio of indigenous to alien vegetation of gardens, residency type, and active and passive food provisioning. Despite conflict, the majority of respondents appreciated urban wildlife (67{\textbackslash}\%) and actively engaged in wildlife watching (88{\textbackslash}\%), emphasizing the importance of incorporating human dimension values into the management of urban biodiversity. Our study highlights the value of citizen science in providing mechanisms for identifying priority management and conservation efforts at the highly complex human-wildlife interface in an urbanized landscape.},

	abstract = {Red foxes thrive in towns and cities, where much of their food is deliberately provided by humans. We studied fox foraging behavior using camera traps in residential gardens where householders regularly fed foxes. Predictable feeding patterns attracted foxes to gardens, females were more efficient foragers than males, and dominant foxes enjoyed priority access to food, so that subordinates had to adopt compensatory strategies. Understanding how foxes exploit resources may help address conflicts in urban areas. In patchy environments, foragers adopt different strategies to acquire resources depending on their internal state and external physical and social environment: this has important fitness consequences. Linking individual variation in patch use to tangible characteristics is key to understand many higher-level ecological processes. We studied patch use by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in the city of Bristol, UK. We placed camera traps in gardens where householders provisioned foxes (patches) to investigate whether 1) foxes discriminated between patches based on food availability, quantified as provisioning frequency (predictability) and the energy value of provisioned food; and 2) individual patch use varied with dominance, gender, and season. Increased frequency of provisioning encouraged more foxes to visit and to stay longer in patches. All foxes visited the most predictable patches first each day, but females were more selective and generally more efficient foragers than males. Females increased foraging effort during cub rearing, whereas males reduced patch use in the dispersal and mating season. Dominants and subordinates shared patches spatiotemporally, possibly facilitated by relatedness and familiarity between group members. However, dominants visited more food patches on their territory, spent more time in predictable patches and fed earlier than subordinates. Subordinates may compensate for competition by visiting patches of lower quality or outside their territory, which is inefficient and risky. Our results demonstrate gender differences in behavioral motivation, show how subordinates forego foraging efficiency to mitigate intra-group competition and reveal how human provisioning influences fox space use in urban areas.},

	abstract = {Many human populations are undergoing an extinction of experience, with a progressive decline in interactions with nature. This is a consequence both of a loss of opportunity for, and orientation towards, such experiences. The trend is of concern in part because interactions with nature can be good for human health and wellbeing. One potential means of redressing these losses is through the intentional provision of resources to increase wildlife populations in close proximity to people, thereby increasing the potential for positive human-nature experiences, and thence the array of benefits that can result. In this paper, we review the evidence that these resource subsidies have such a cascade of effects. In some Westernized countries, the scale of provision is extraordinarily high, and doubtless leads to both positive and negative impacts for wildlife. In turn, these impacts often lead to more frequent, reliable and closer human-nature interactions, with a greater variety of species. The consequences for human wellbeing remain poorly understood, although benefits documented in the context of human-nature interactions more broadly seem likely to apply. There are also some important feedback loops that need to be better characterized if resource provisioning is to contribute effectively towards averting the extinction of experience.

In general, patterns of internet searches were highest during April-August, reflecting key events for foxes such as denning and cub rearing. Increased searches for human-fox conflict solutions during this same period may also reflect changes in human behavior (e.g., increased garden usage). Annual increases in some search terms suggested an increasing awareness of foxes and problems with the species.

With bee communities at risk, conservation efforts are imperative. Although recent research has examined bee communities across cities, few studies have analyzed variation in human attitudes toward and perceptions of bees, or how these perspectives might influence bee conservation. We therefore analyzed residents' attitudes toward and perceptions of bees, specifically in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. Primarily drawing upon 2017 survey data (n = 496, 39{\textbackslash}\% response rate), we posed the following questions: 1) What cognitive, environmental, and social factors explain whether people like or dislike bees? and 2) How do attitudes and perceptions about bees relate to land management practices, specifically landscaping choices, herbicide and pesticide use, and desert plantings? Overall, attitudes toward bees were mostly neutral with a slight trend toward dislike but most residents did not believe bees were problematic at their homes. Additional findings reveal that risk perceptions, ecological worldviews, and pet ownership significantly explained attitudes toward bees. Moreover, people who live closer to desert parks had relatively positive attitudes toward bees. Regarding yard management practices, both attitudes toward and perceptions of bees were positively correlated with adding desert plants to residential yards. Moreover, people who use pesticides had more negative attitudes toward bees. Our results indicate conservation potential for urban bee populations, for example, by planting native vegetation in residential areas near desert preserves. We hope this study will result in more attitudinal research on bee species and other understudied urban wildlife.},

Wildscaping, a type of stewardship PEB in which people create wildlife friendly gardens, has been promoted by conservation organizations, yet fundamental questions remain about what wildscaping entails and what factors contribute to sustained involvement. We used a social-ecological systems (SES) framework to examine behavior change among urban residents in Colorado who had received wildscape gardening certification and training. We employed semi-structured interviews (n = 11), quantitative surveys (n = 63), participant observation, and document analysis, and analyzed data using grounded theoretical techniques. We found that program participants engaged in 14 gardening behaviors targeting habitat creation on their properties, and 11 advocacy behaviors targeting social change. These behaviors were driven by 10 interconnected motivations, including mutual refuge with wildlife, changing norms, aesthetic beauty, and sense of place. Engagement in wildscaping was sustained over time by multi-scalar contextual factors, including social interactions and formal program participation. These findings offer the first SES understanding of how urban residents begin and expand their engagement in wildscape gardening and advocacy. Future research should focus on how understanding of SES characteristics can enable more effective behavior change programs in urban landscapes. Possible ways that conservation outreach could consider SES include encouraging evolving feedback loops between participants' motivations and behaviors, emphasizing reciprocal benefits to individuals and their social-ecological context, and promoting coordinated involvement by different types of actors at multiple scales of the system.},

Embracing the epistemological assumption that urban residents' interactions with nature in their gardens and parks may be complex, unpredictable, contradictory, and context-dependent, we used an interpretative phenomenological analysis approach to explore the human relationship with urban nature in a New Zealand city. We conducted 21 semi-structured ``go-along\{''\} interviews to facilitate a deeper understanding of participants' personal experiences of nature in parks and gardens. Interviews revealed a tension between stated values and concrete actions affecting urban biodiversity in private gardens. This value-action gap stemmed from the multiple purposes and values that people hold for their gardens, which do not necessarily align with conservation of native nature. By recognizing that urban residents hold multiple values and want their gardens to fulfill multiple purposes, local authorities aiming to promote nature conservation in cities can design wildlife gardening programs that meet these multiple needs and reconcile conflicting priorities.},

To realize this opportunity, a comprehensive understanding of which species prosper in gardens, which mechanisms promote their use of these green spaces and how these mechanisms can be manipulated by residents to achieve conservation outcomes, is needed. While substantial progress has been made in evaluating the mechanisms that influence the diversity, presence, and abundance of wildlife in gardens, how these mechanisms vary seasonally is largely unknown. This study investigated whether the garden features influencing the presence and/or abundance of arboreal, flying, and ground-dwelling mammals in gardens varied seasonally using acoustic, trapping, and spotlighting surveys undertaken in four consecutive seasons (2018/19) in 52 gardens in southwestern Australia. As animal behavior and resource availability varies seasonally, we predicted that garden features influencing the presence and abundance of mammals in gardens would also vary seasonally. For arboreal and ground-dwelling mammals, we found that some garden features (e.g., canopy cover and presence of dogs, respectively) were important in more than one season; however, none were important in all seasons with most only being influential in one. No garden features predicted the presence of flying mammals in more than one season. Our results suggest that sampling in a single or few seasons may fail to identify features influencing wildlife at times other than in the season of sampling, or alternatively, may overemphasize factors that do not operate across all seasons. Studies that consider the mechanisms on a seasonal basis will provide a more comprehensive list of features influencing the presence and abundance of animals in gardens. We suggest it is both those features that support wildlife in multiple or all seasons, and those that support critical life-history events in a single season that could contribute to conservation if manipulated by residents appropriately.},

For some terrestrial species with limited climbing abilities, property boundaries can pose a significant problem by limiting access to residential gardens. The West European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) has declined markedly in the UK but is commonly found in areas of human habitation, including residential gardens. `Hedgehog Street' is a public engagement campaign aimed at recruiting volunteers ('Hedgehog Champions') to create access points ('hedgehog highways') across garden boundaries to improve habitat connectivity. In this study, we used a series of questionnaire surveys to explore motivations for and obstacles to the creation of highways. Householders were more likely to have created a highway if they were already aware of the Hedgehog Street campaign, if their garden contained a high number of wildlife-friendly features and if they considered watching wildlife to be important. Hedgehog Champions created, on average, 1.69 highways each with 52.0{\textbackslash}\% creating none; this would equate to an estimated {\textgreater}120,000 across all registered Champions. In comparison, 6.1-29.8{\textbackslash}\% of non-Champions stated that they had made a highway. However, most highways had been created in boundaries that could already be traversed via naturally occurring holes: only 11.4{\textbackslash}\% of garden boundaries could be traversed, and 3.2{\textbackslash}\% of gardens accessed, just via a hedgehog highway. In addition, only 5.0{\textbackslash}\% of gardens were considered totally inaccessible to hedgehogs. The most common reasons cited for not having made a highway were that householders' gardens were already accessible to hedgehogs followed by concerns relating to boundary ownership and / or communicating with neighbours. Future studies need to identify strategies for overcoming these obstacles to maximize citizen engagement, particularly with those householders who are not innately ``wildlife-friendly\{''\}, and to quantify the degree to which networks of highways affect patterns of individual movement and, ultimately, populations.},

In addition, the motivations and constraints underlying decisions to manage traditional lawns, water-conserving yards, native plants, and other landscape types are well understood. Yet relatively little research has addressed people's decisions to adopt wildlife-supporting yards. Analyzing survey data from six U.S. cities, we address three related questions: 1) to what extent do residents choose yard features that support wildlife habitat?; 2) how do yard priorities and neighborhood governance, along with socio-demographic factors, explain the adoption of wildlife-supporting features?; and 3) how do residents who have already adopted wildlife-supporting yard features differ in their motivations from those who plan to adopt such features and those who do not? We found significant potential for adding vegetation (specifically shrubs and native plants) and other wildlife-supporting features to increase yard complexity and vegetation diversity. While gardening as a hobby was a significant motivator for people who have adopted wildlife yard features, the desire for low maintenance yards is a constraint among non-adopters. We therefore recommend promoting the planting of low-maintenance plant species or varieties that provide wildlife habitat but require little upkeep, especially among residents who would like to attract wildlife to their yards into the future. We also found that neighbourhood and homeowner associations increase the local adoption of wildlife-supporting yards. Coupled with other findings, our results underscore the importance of tailoring residential landscape features to diverse lifestyles while leveraging social institutions to expand wildlife habitat across urban and suburban neighborhoods.},

	abstract = {Wildlife are increasingly being found in urban habitats, and likely rely on some resources in suburban household yards, which exposes them to the effects of yard management and human and pet activities. We compared the relationships between these potential disturbances and benefits to the number of different types of wildlife sighted by householders, using written surveys. Owing to the inability of many household respondents to identify animals to the species or genus level, each different `type' of animal individually listed was counted to generate the total number of types of wildlife observed by each household. We found that relatively more types of wildlife were observed by residents whose yards provided ease of faunal access under or through fences, had reduced pesticide use, increased levels of anthropogenic noise, and increased presence of pets in yards. The latter two associations likely relate to the increased opportunities to observe wildlife in yards that each creates. We also investigated the use of yards by wildlife and domestic pets in open compared to more vegetated habitats by day and night, using motion-sensor cameras. All animals observed were compared to the activity of introduced brown and black rats (Rattus norvegicus, R. rattus), owing to their wild origins but long commensal history with humans. Camera images indicated that animals' natural activity periods were maintained in yards. Brown antechinuses (Antechinus stuartii), northern brown bandicoots (Isoodon macrourus), domestic cats (Felis catus) and native birds (species as listed below) each preferred sheltered or vegetated habitats over open habitats, when compared to the introduced rats that showed little habitat preference. However, unlike the other species, the native birds used open areas more than vegetated or sheltered areas when compared within their group only. The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) was observed to use open areas comparatively more than the introduced rats, but used vegetated or sheltered habitats more when compared to self only. The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) used open areas more than vegetated or sheltered areas, when compared to the introduced rats, and against themselves. This indicated a level of coping with urban stressors by the native animals, but with a reliance on more vegetated habitats to allow for natural stress-relieving behaviours of escape or hiding. Here, we offer insights into how each of these findings may be used to help educate and motivate increased household responsibility for urban wildlife conservation.},

In urban landscapes, such knowledge can be used to advise householders on how best to manage their gardens for wildlife. In this study, we tracked 28 West European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), a species of conservation concern in the UK, in an area of high-density housing using radio and GPS tags to quantify patterns of habitat use and identify factors associated with the proportion of time spent in individual gardens. Both males and females exhibited a preference for residential gardens, but there were subtle differences between the sexes in relation to house type and front versus back gardens. Hedgehogs spent significantly more time in gardens where artificial food was provided, where a compost heap was present, if foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were infrequent visitors, if it rained overnight and as daylength increased (i.e., shorter nights); garden use was not significantly associated with variables potentially likely to reflect invertebrate prey abundance. These data suggest that the primary positive action that householders can undertake for urban hedgehogs is providing supplementary food. However, householders often feed hedgehogs after they know they are already visiting their garden. Consequently, the presence of artificial food may make it difficult to identify other important influences affecting garden use. Finally, we report that a GPS fix acquisition rate {\textless} 60{\textbackslash}\% likely had no major effect on the results of our analyses, but should be a consideration in future studies using this technique on this species and in this habitat.},

We surveyed 658 residents in Berlin, Germany, to assess (i) the acceptability of management actions differing in their severity for non-native plants and animals compared to native species with similar traits, (ii) the influence of perceived distance of species (i.e. close to residence and elsewhere) and (iii) the predictive potential of psychometric (i.e. values, beliefs, self-assessed knowledge, emotions and anthropomorphism) and socio-demographic factors for this acceptability. Eradication (i.e. lethal control/removal) was generally the least accepted management action, but more accepted for non-native than native species. Distance mattered for the acceptability of non-native plant management with unspecified control action the most accepted management action close to residence. While values (self-transcendence and conservation) mostly explained the acceptability of doing nothing and eradication, emotions related strongly to all management actions. Beliefs were more important than self-assessed knowledge in relation to non-native species management and beliefs about non-native plants and animals were rated almost similar. Anthropomorphic views had predictive potential for plants and animals; that is, the stronger people held anthropomorphic views, the less they accepted eradication. Participants with a garden supported doing nothing with plants (native and non-native) more than without. Results highlight the complexity of factors underlying the acceptability of management actions on species in cities. While values, beliefs and self-assessed knowledge are important in the context of species management, other psychometric factors add to our understanding of acceptability. We conclude that awareness about different acceptability patterns related to species management can support environmental policies on biological invasions in cities. Tailoring and implementing adequate management actions can benefit from incorporating cognitive but also affective factors of the public.

	abstract = {Residential yards are a form of urban land use that cover a considerable amount of area in cities worldwide and provide important habitat for wildlife, especially when landscaped with native plants. Nevertheless, most native-plant landscaping and wildlife research in the northern temperate regions of the world has been conducted during the spring and summer breeding period, leaving a gap in our understanding of the importance of residential yards and native plants as habitats for animals during the nonbreeding period. To fill this gap, we quantified the ecological role of native-landscaped yards to avifauna throughout Greater Los Angeles (LA), California, during the winter nonbreeding period, which is a time of year when the region hosts a high abundance and diversity of migratory and resident birds. We surveyed birds and habitat features from October to March of 2020 and 2021 at 22 pairs of native- and non-native-landscaped yards plus 10 additional native-landscaped yards. We had three objectives for our study. First, we compared avifaunal communities, including feeding and nonfeeding behaviors, and habitat features between native and non-native-landscaped yards. Second, we quantified relationships between habitat features and bird richness, abundance, and feeding and nonfeeding behaviors-focusing on species affiliated with urban or natural terrestrial ecosystems of the region. Third, we documented feeding and nonfeeding behaviors by birds with native and non-native plants. Native-landscaped yards had a greater cover of native trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, and a higher cover of natural habitat elements, including leaf litter and bare-ground cover. Bird richness and abundance-especially bird species affiliated with tree- and shrub-dominated cosystems-were greater in native than non-native-landscaped yards. Further, yards with a higher cover of native plants supported greater numbers of feeding birds, with individuals focusing their foraging behaviors on distinct native trees and shrubs, including Quercus spp. (oak), Heteromeles spp. (toyon), Arctostaphylos spp. (manzanita), and Salvia spp. (sage). Our results suggest that residential yards landscaped with native plants provide important habitat for birds during the nonbreeding period and are a viable approach for residents and cities if improving conditions for birds throughout the annual cycle is a goal.},

	abstract = {Urbanization is increasing globally, with concomitant negative effects on biodiversity and human well-being. In urban areas, gardens may contribute to overall green space, bringing benefits to wildlife and residents. We used a community science approach to gather data and understand the role of urban gardens for wildlife and for residents in a developing country, where information on the subject is scarce. We evaluated how local characteristics and landscape quality influenced the presence of three native birds and two insect species as indicators of habitat conservation value, in a town immersed in an Argentinean National Park. We also estimated gardens' value during COVID-19 quarantine to assess whether owners appreciated them more when outdoor activities were not allowed, increasing awareness of the value of nature for well-being. We found that most respondents enjoy birdwatching in their gardens and consider birds as beneficial; however, the pleasure of observing insects is lower. The relevance of local garden characteristics differed according to the species in question, highlighting the importance of using different species as indicators to assess garden conservation value. The proportion of tree cover surrounding the gardens had a positive effect on the probability of finding birds and insects, while the proportion of built-up area had a negative effect. During COVID-19 lockdown, most respondents enjoyed their gardens equally or more than usual, and those that assigned a monetary value to gardens, chose the highest one. We encouraged initiatives that engage, inform and empower residents on wildlife-friendly gardening to favor the inclusion of gardens as part of wider conservation and urban planning strategies.},

	abstract = {The combination of increasing numbers of people in cities, coupled with decreasing levels of biodiversity, is hypothesised to result in the extinction of experience, or the continued disintegration of the human relationship with the natural world. We use the concepts of sense of place and dwelling to investigate the human relationship with nature in cities by considering the emotional connections between people and places. We conducted `goalong' interviews with 21 residents of Hamilton, New Zealand, to explore the significance of neighbourhood parks and home gardens in the lives of urban residents. Our study highlights the importance of greenspaces in cities to the physical, mental and social health of local residents. Bush parks provided the best opportunities for respondents to observe nature and thereby escape the stress of city life. Participants wanted a variety of parks which would meet the range of their community's needs and provide habitat for wildlife. Proximity and frequent use of parks resulted in a sense of ownership and responsibility which led to concrete action, such as participation in ecological restoration of valued greenspaces. Providing high quality natural greenspaces within walking distance of residents' homes disrupts the extinction of experience by fostering positive personal experiences of nature, crucial for the health and wellbeing of people and for native biodiversity.},
