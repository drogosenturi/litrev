AB  - The primary threat to biodiversity is habitat loss and degradation. Private residential land (yards) encompass large proportions of urban, suburban, and rural spaces and is among the most rapidly expanding systems on Earth. Yards also represent a conservation opportunity to provide wildlife habitat, support biodiversity, restore ecosystem function and ecosystem services, and increase local opportunities for people to connect with nature. In the present article, we propose a humanity for habitat stewardship practice by synthesizing the evidence-based yard management actions that can advance the conservation value of yards, with a focus on benefits to biodiversity, climate resiliency, and people. The magnitude and extent of yard management might differ, depending on the region, specific management practices, the yard's size, and the yard's location along the urban to rural gradient. We detail opportunities, challenges, and strategies for encouraging stronger public participation in conservation through yard stewardship to facilitate biodiversity-friendly residential landscapes that benefit wildlife and people.

AB  - Residential gardens are a principal component of urban green infrastructure throughout the world and their potential positive contributions to biodiversity are increasingly recognised. But the characteristics of gardens reflect the needs, values and interests of individual households. The present review summarises evidence from studies of garden biodiversity published in the scientific literature, describes major themes and identifies important knowledge gaps. A search of the Web of Science database identified 408 published articles on the biodiversity of residential gardens (1981-2022), with numbers increasing over time and a strong bias towards Europe (32.1%) and North America (23.8%). Plants and invertebrates were most frequently studied, and species diversity was often correlated with garden size and habitat complexity. Botanic composition and vegetation cover were often positively associated with the diversity and abundance of fauna. Non-native plants contributed substantially to garden plant diversity and evidence from some studies indicated benefits to other species linked to their functional attributes. Intensive management including frequent lawn mowing, fertiliser and pesticide application, and a more formal, 'neater' garden appearance were often associated with reduced biodiversity. However, results varied amongst studies, for example in relation to the impacts of mowing frequency on lawn diversity. There was a general paucity of experimental evidence on the impacts of different management regimes on garden biodiversity and few replicated experimental tests of recommended 'wildlife-friendly practices'. Several studies identified the importance of connectivity amongst gardens and with other green infra-structure for species dispersal and ecosystem functioning. Emerging threats to garden biodiversity include their replacement by development, conversion to hard surfaces and declining plot sizes. Managing these challenges and maximising the biodiversity value of residential gardens requires greater engagement from policymakers and planners, and partnerships between public bodies and private households to co-ordinate local initiatives.

AB  - Zoonotic disease vectors, their wildlife hosts, and the surrounding landscape interact in complex ways that vary spatially, temporally and with anthropogenic change. Ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) are one of the most important vectors of human disease globally but managing the risk of tick bites in urban areas requires a detailed understanding of these complex vector-host-environment relationships at multiple spatial scales. Extensive knowledge gaps of these interactions in Australia limits options for managing ticks and exacerbates human-wildlife conflict. To address this, we used an online survey to determine the potential drivers of human-tick encounters operating at the local, yard scale and at the broader, landscape scale in a peri-urban area of Australia. We explored the relationships between reported tick encounters in yards and yard traits, host sightings (yard-scale) and broader landscape traits (landscape-scale). We found that sightings of potential hosts such as long-nosed bandicoots (Perameles nasuta) and brush-turkeys (Alectura lathami), and broader landscape traits such as distance to wet sclerophyll forest, were important predictors of reported tick encounters. Yard traits such as garden mulching and leaf litter cover showed no relationships with tick encounters. However, garden mulching and the absence of pets were predictors of frequent bandicoot sightings in yards. Mulching over 20m(2), moderate to dense leaf litter cover on lawns, and living adjacent to bush were predictors of frequent brush-turkey sightings in yards. Our results suggest that residents may be able to reduce tick encounter risk by making yards less attractive to potential hosts. The observed relationships provide a critical foundation for field studies that can determine underlying mechanisms and inform appropriate tick management in urban environments.

AB  - 1,3-Diphenylguanidine (DPG), benzothiazole (BTH), benzotriazole (BTR), and their derivatives are high-production -volume chemicals widely used in tires, corrosion inhibitors and plastic products. Vehicular traffic is an important source of these chemicals in the environment. Despite this, little is known about the occurrence of these chemicals in roadside soils. In this study, we determined the concentrations, profiles, and distribution patterns of 3 DPGs, 5 BTHs, and 7 BTRs in 110 soil samples collected from northeastern United States. We found widespread occurrence of 12 out of the 15 analytes measured in roadside soils, at detection frequencies >= 71 % and median concentrations in the range of 0.38-380 ng/g (dry weight). DPGs were the predominant chemicals accounting for 63 % of the sum concentrations of three chemical classes determined, followed by BTHs (28 %) and BTRs (9 %). The concentrations of all analytes (except for 1-, 4-, and 5-OH-BTRs) exhibited significant positive correlations (r: 0.1-0.9, p < 0.01), sug-gestive of their common sources and/or similar environmental fates. Higher concentrations of DPGs, BTHs and BTRs were found in soils from highways, rubberized playgrounds, and indoor parking lots than those from gardens, parks, and residential areas. Our findings suggest the release of DPGs, BTHs and BTRs from rubber products, especially auto-mobile tires. Further studies are needed to investigate the environmental fate and toxicities of these chemicals to humans and wildlife.

AB  - Smooth-coated otters (Lutrogale perspicillata) were transient in Singapore before one resident family group was observed in 1998, presumably having recolonized from Peninsular Malaysia. A population survey in 2017 revealed a minimum of 11 groups and 79 individuals. Since then, movements of otter groups within urban areas have led to increasing numbers of human-otter encounters, including conflicts. We determined the current abundance, population structure, and distribution of smooth-coated otters in Singapore. We assessed seven sampling zones nationwide through verified sighting records and social media. Mortality records from 2019 to 2021 were sourced from the Otter Working Group and Wildlife Reserves Singapore. In early 2021, there were a minimum of 17 groups and 170 individuals. Groups ranged from 2 to 24 individuals. Smooth-coated otters occupy coastal areas, waterways, reservoirs, and sites within the city center in urban gardens and ponds. Following territorial conflicts at waterways, smooth-coated otter groups moved into the urban matrix. Vehicle collisions are the main cause of mortality and are frequent at dams separating freshwater and coastal habitats. While there is a clear increase in smooth-coated otter numbers since 2017, there remain multiple natural and human-caused threats to otter persistence.

AB  - Urban fauna is defined as animal species that can live in urban environments. Several species, including the western-European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), have now been identified as part of this urban fauna, becoming permanent residents of parks and gardens in different cities across Europe. Due to the importance that this phenomenon represents for zoonotic disease surveillance, several authors have been conducting zoonotic agents' surveys on hedgehog. The aim of this study is to compare zoonotic diseases' prevalence in hedgehogs in urban environments with those from more rural areas. A systematic review with meta-analysis of twelve studied of zoonotic diseases' (in urban and rural areas of Europe) was therefore conducted for this purpose. Fifteen different zoonoses have been assessed in urban environments and six in rural areas. Anaplasma phagocytophilum was the most prevalent zoonotic agent found in urban habitats (96%). Dermatophytosis shows statistically significant differences between locations (p-value < 0.001), with a higher prevalence in urban Poland (55%; n = 182). Our results suggest further research and a standardized monitoring of different hedgehog populations are essential to understanding the epidemiology of several zoonotic pathogens in different habitat types (urban, rural, natural, industrial, etc.) and preventing possible disease outbreaks.

AB  - The combination of increasing numbers of people in cities, coupled with decreasing levels of biodiversity, is hypothesised to result in the extinction of experience, or the continued disintegration of the human relationship with the natural world. We use the concepts of sense of place and dwelling to investigate the human relationship with nature in cities by considering the emotional connections between people and places. We conducted 'goalong' interviews with 21 residents of Hamilton, New Zealand, to explore the significance of neighbourhood parks and home gardens in the lives of urban residents. Our study highlights the importance of greenspaces in cities to the physical, mental and social health of local residents. Bush parks provided the best opportunities for respondents to observe nature and thereby escape the stress of city life. Participants wanted a variety of parks which would meet the range of their community's needs and provide habitat for wildlife. Proximity and frequent use of parks resulted in a sense of ownership and responsibility which led to concrete action, such as participation in ecological restoration of valued greenspaces. Providing high quality natural greenspaces within walking distance of residents' homes disrupts the extinction of experience by fostering positive personal experiences of nature, crucial for the health and wellbeing of people and for native biodiversity.

AB  - Assessing the underlying mechanisms of species co-occurrence patterns can be challenging as biotic and abiotic factors are hard to disentangle. To date, few studies have investigated co-occurrence patterns of mammals within urban areas. As urban areas are increasingly used as habitat by wildlife, there is a need for a better understanding of urban ecology to facilitate human-wildlife co-existence. Here, we investigated co-occurrence patterns and habitat selection of the European hare (Lepus europaeus), mountain hare (L. timidus), and European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) inside urban areas of Sweden, using joint species distribution models and generalized linear mixed models based on citizen science observations. All three species were observed within urban areas, but European hares and rabbits appear to be more successful urban colonizers compared to mountain hares. Overall, our findings suggested that urban occurrence by all three lagomorphs was related to suitable conditions within the distribution of each species (e.g., climate and elevation), rather than by the presence of other lagomorph species or specific land cover types within urban areas. On a finer spatial scale, European hares and rabbits generally selected for green urban areas and mountain hares for residential gardens, which likely constitute suitable foraging sites. Moreover, overlap in activity times between European hares and rabbits was mediated by land cover type and sympatry. Our findings contribute to the understanding of urban ecology and provide insights for management measures of the three lagomorphs in urban areas of Sweden.

AB  - Residential yards are a form of urban land use that cover a considerable amount of area in cities worldwide and provide important habitat for wildlife, especially when landscaped with native plants. Nevertheless, most native-plant landscaping and wildlife research in the northern temperate regions of the world has been conducted during the spring and summer breeding period, leaving a gap in our understanding of the importance of residential yards and native plants as habitats for animals during the nonbreeding period. To fill this gap, we quantified the ecological role of native-landscaped yards to avifauna throughout Greater Los Angeles (LA), California, during the winter nonbreeding period, which is a time of year when the region hosts a high abundance and diversity of migratory and resident birds. We surveyed birds and habitat features from October to March of 2020 and 2021 at 22 pairs of native- and non-native-landscaped yards plus 10 additional native-landscaped yards. We had three objectives for our study. First, we compared avifaunal communities, including feeding and nonfeeding behaviors, and habitat features between native and non-native-landscaped yards. Second, we quantified relationships between habitat features and bird richness, abundance, and feeding and nonfeeding behaviors-focusing on species affiliated with urban or natural terrestrial ecosystems of the region. Third, we documented feeding and nonfeeding behaviors by birds with native and non-native plants. Native-landscaped yards had a greater cover of native trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, and a higher cover of natural habitat elements, including leaf litter and bare-ground cover. Bird richness and abundance-especially bird species affiliated with tree- and shrub-dominated cosystems-were greater in native than non-native-landscaped yards. Further, yards with a higher cover of native plants supported greater numbers of feeding birds, with individuals focusing their foraging behaviors on distinct native trees and shrubs, including Quercus spp. (oak), Heteromeles spp. (toyon), Arctostaphylos spp. (manzanita), and Salvia spp. (sage). Our results suggest that residential yards landscaped with native plants provide important habitat for birds during the nonbreeding period and are a viable approach for residents and cities if improving conditions for birds throughout the annual cycle is a goal.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to study the functioning of the Russian traditional agro-industrial structure in the landscape and climatic conditions of the Northern Trans-Urals during the period from 1700s to 1830s. Following L.S. Berg, we understand the landscape as "... regular groupings of objects and phenomena on the land surface, on the bottom and on the surface of the sea (and in general reservoirs), due to the regular repetition of the properties and features of soils and rocky soils, rock formations, aquatic environment, relief, vegetation, wildlife, human and his material and spiritual culture aspects". The sources of the study include economic and geographical descriptions of the region left by contemporaries and the office records of local government agencies as well.
   Due to the landscape and climatic conditions of the Northern Trans-Urals, arable farming in the north of the region did not go beyond experiments and it was sporadic in the south. At least the Berezovitsy and Surgutyans had vegetable gardens since the second half of the 18th century. As time went on, the range of plants expanded, and the truck farming advanced to Obdorsk. The hunter was primarily interested in fur-bearing animals, whose reserves were largely depleted (especially in the cities), but still provided the hunter with acceptable prey sizes. Stocks of the other fur-bearing animals, birds, fish and wild plants remained at a very high level. Tools, methods and timing of fishing activities depended on time of the year, terrain features and behavioral attitudes of fur-bearing animals. The fishing activity was complicated by the fact that the lands, except for suburban ones, had to be rented from the aborigines. Cattle breeding was restrained by the lack of hayfields, their quality (hummocks, shrubs) and the relief of floodplain spaces - in case of high flood, bottomland meadows went under water for a long time. Keeping sheep, pigs, and poultry was complicated by a huge number of dogs. Dogs and deer were widely used for trips through the taiga and tundra. The structure of handicraft lessons had been organically integrated into the landscape. In the 1820s, the Berezov's residents engaged in the deer skins manufacturing. In summer river transport became the only type of transport in the region. Shipbuilding and ship repair work required specialists - carpenters and blacksmiths.

AB  - Sugar-water bird feeding in residential backyards is increasingly popular, but its effects on wildlife are poorly understood. One concern is whether it results in maladaptive behaviour, such as reliance on artificial food or increased aggression due to increased density of visiting individuals. We studied sugar-water feeder-associated bird behaviour in two cities with different climates. We investigate whether season, city, or sugar concentration influenced bird foraging activity and aggressiveness. We then test whether feeder presence affected backyard bird composition. Birds were most aggressive and used sugar-water feeders most actively in winter, especially the omnivorous native tauhou (Zosterops lateralis). We also found city and seasonal differences in sugar-water feeder usage and aggression. Further, in Auckland, the city with the warmer climate, New Zealand's largest nectarivorous species, tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae), was more likely to be aggressive at feeders with higher sugar concentrations but foraged longer at feeders with lower sugar concentrations. Neither feeder presence nor sugar concentration influenced garden bird species richness or abundance. We discuss the effects of sugar-water feeding on bird behaviour at the global and local scale and suggest future study directions.

AB  - Managing non-native species in cities is often controversial because these species can support both ecosystem services and disservices. Yet, how the acceptability of non-native species management by the general public differs in relation to native species, to distance (i.e. close to residence and elsewhere) and among plants and animals is understudied. Furthermore, while values, beliefs and knowledge are often considered in this context, psychometric factors such as emotions and anthropomorphic views have received little attention. We surveyed 658 residents in Berlin, Germany, to assess (i) the acceptability of management actions differing in their severity for non-native plants and animals compared to native species with similar traits, (ii) the influence of perceived distance of species (i.e. close to residence and elsewhere) and (iii) the predictive potential of psychometric (i.e. values, beliefs, self-assessed knowledge, emotions and anthropomorphism) and socio-demographic factors for this acceptability. Eradication (i.e. lethal control/removal) was generally the least accepted management action, but more accepted for non-native than native species. Distance mattered for the acceptability of non-native plant management with unspecified control action the most accepted management action close to residence. While values (self-transcendence and conservation) mostly explained the acceptability of doing nothing and eradication, emotions related strongly to all management actions. Beliefs were more important than self-assessed knowledge in relation to non-native species management and beliefs about non-native plants and animals were rated almost similar. Anthropomorphic views had predictive potential for plants and animals; that is, the stronger people held anthropomorphic views, the less they accepted eradication. Participants with a garden supported doing nothing with plants (native and non-native) more than without. Results highlight the complexity of factors underlying the acceptability of management actions on species in cities. While values, beliefs and self-assessed knowledge are important in the context of species management, other psychometric factors add to our understanding of acceptability. We conclude that awareness about different acceptability patterns related to species management can support environmental policies on biological invasions in cities. Tailoring and implementing adequate management actions can benefit from incorporating cognitive but also affective factors of the public.

AB  - Urbanization is increasing globally, with concomitant negative effects on biodiversity and human well-being. In urban areas, gardens may contribute to overall green space, bringing benefits to wildlife and residents. We used a community science approach to gather data and understand the role of urban gardens for wildlife and for residents in a developing country, where information on the subject is scarce. We evaluated how local characteristics and landscape quality influenced the presence of three native birds and two insect species as indicators of habitat conservation value, in a town immersed in an Argentinean National Park. We also estimated gardens' value during COVID-19 quarantine to assess whether owners appreciated them more when outdoor activities were not allowed, increasing awareness of the value of nature for well-being. We found that most respondents enjoy birdwatching in their gardens and consider birds as beneficial; however, the pleasure of observing insects is lower. The relevance of local garden characteristics differed according to the species in question, highlighting the importance of using different species as indicators to assess garden conservation value. The proportion of tree cover surrounding the gardens had a positive effect on the probability of finding birds and insects, while the proportion of built-up area had a negative effect. During COVID-19 lockdown, most respondents enjoyed their gardens equally or more than usual, and those that assigned a monetary value to gardens, chose the highest one. We encouraged initiatives that engage, inform and empower residents on wildlife-friendly gardening to favor the inclusion of gardens as part of wider conservation and urban planning strategies.

AB  - Sustainable landscaping programs are voluntary initiatives that recommend a set of practices to improve the environmental quality of urban ecosystems by providing landscaping materials, guidelines, and educational resources. Our goal was to examine the recommendations and outcomes of these programs in the United States and their value for encouraging conservation practices in residential ecosystems. We conducted a comprehensive web search and identified 193 sustainable landscaping programs in the United States. Programs aim to increase native species richness, affordably manage stormwater runoff, and offer residents meaningful experiences with nature. Sustainable landscaping programs present many opportunities to engage people with local ecological knowledge and conservation practices, provide accessible spaces for environmental education, cultivate interdisciplinary research collaborations, and advance inclusion in conservation. However, assessments of their ecological value are rare, leaving many questions surrounding the benefits to biodiversity and water quality afforded by participation. Many programs also require investments in landscaping materials and certification fees that might limit participation by some households. Future work should examine how recommended practices influence urban biodiversity, identify and address barriers to participation, and generate social-ecological knowledge that can inform future programs.

AB  - Residential gardens can provide essential opportunities for native wildlife and represent a valuable way of creating new habitats. Bandicoots (marsupial family Peramelidae) are medium-sized digging mammals that play a valuable role in maintaining ecosystem health; retaining these important ecosystem engineers across urban landscapes, including in private gardens, can have enormous conservation benefits. Urbanisation is a significant threat for some bandicoot species, and therefore understanding the factors associated with their activity can help guide urban landscape and garden design. To identify key features associated with the activity of a local endemic bandicoot species, the quenda (Isoodon fusciventer), we carried out a camera trap survey of front and back yards for 65 residential properties in the City of Mandurah, Western Australia. We compared quenda activity with biotic and abiotic factors that could indicate potential predation risk (activity of domestic dogs Canis familiaris and cats Felis catus, and the presence of artificial or natural protective cover), food availability (including deliberate or inadvertent supplementary feeding, provision of water, and diggable surfaces) and garden acces-sibility (distance to bushland, permeability of boundary fencing, and garden position). Supplementary feeding was strongly associated with quenda activity. Quenda were also more active in back yards, and in gardens where there was greater vegetation cover. Of concern, quenda activity was positively associated with cat activity, which could reflect that straying pet cats are attracted to gardens that harbour wildlife populations, including quenda. Furthermore, almost half of the gardens showed cat activity despite only a small sample of the surveyed residents owning a pet cat. Results of this study can help guide the design of residential gardens to increase useful habitat for these important digging mammals. Vegetation, wood mulch and semi-permeable fencing can provide valu-able resources needed to support the persistence of quendas across the rapidly changing urban landscape mosaic, where natural and managed (e.g., gardens and parks) green spaces are becoming less common and more isolated.

AB  - Understanding patterns of habitat selection and factors affecting space use is fundamental in animal conservation. In urban landscapes, such knowledge can be used to advise householders on how best to manage their gardens for wildlife. In this study, we tracked 28 West European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), a species of conservation concern in the UK, in an area of high-density housing using radio and GPS tags to quantify patterns of habitat use and identify factors associated with the proportion of time spent in individual gardens. Both males and females exhibited a preference for residential gardens, but there were subtle differences between the sexes in relation to house type and front versus back gardens. Hedgehogs spent significantly more time in gardens where artificial food was provided, where a compost heap was present, if foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were infrequent visitors, if it rained overnight and as daylength increased (i.e., shorter nights); garden use was not significantly associated with variables potentially likely to reflect invertebrate prey abundance. These data suggest that the primary positive action that householders can undertake for urban hedgehogs is providing supplementary food. However, householders often feed hedgehogs after they know they are already visiting their garden. Consequently, the presence of artificial food may make it difficult to identify other important influences affecting garden use. Finally, we report that a GPS fix acquisition rate < 60% likely had no major effect on the results of our analyses, but should be a consideration in future studies using this technique on this species and in this habitat.

AB  - Home food gardening is an important component of urban agriculture and sustainable food systems. However, globally there has been limited research into the barriers and enablers to home food gardening in cities. This study used an exploratory approach, utilising a questionnaire survey of households, and in-depth interviews with gardening experts, to assess barriers and enablers to home food gardening in the City of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. Overall, nine themes were identified that were common across both survey and interview data. These were time, cost, space, knowledge, ownership, soil, wildlife and pests, mobility, support and access, and community. Barriers vary depending on individual circumstances and are often compounding. Our results indicate that while many households are now growing food, or are interested in growing food, there are limitations on the percentage of food intake that households can grow at home. Key factors to growing more food include control over property, available land, and gardening experience and know-how. Our findings highlight the need for policy, programs, and resources, especially at the level of local governments, that can contribute to an increase in the amount of local, home grown food in cities.

AB  - Wildlife are increasingly being found in urban habitats, and likely rely on some resources in suburban household yards, which exposes them to the effects of yard management and human and pet activities. We compared the relationships between these potential disturbances and benefits to the number of different types of wildlife sighted by householders, using written surveys. Owing to the inability of many household respondents to identify animals to the species or genus level, each different 'type' of animal individually listed was counted to generate the total number of types of wildlife observed by each household. We found that relatively more types of wildlife were observed by residents whose yards provided ease of faunal access under or through fences, had reduced pesticide use, increased levels of anthropogenic noise, and increased presence of pets in yards. The latter two associations likely relate to the increased opportunities to observe wildlife in yards that each creates. We also investigated the use of yards by wildlife and domestic pets in open compared to more vegetated habitats by day and night, using motion-sensor cameras. All animals observed were compared to the activity of introduced brown and black rats (Rattus norvegicus, R. rattus), owing to their wild origins but long commensal history with humans. Camera images indicated that animals' natural activity periods were maintained in yards. Brown antechinuses (Antechinus stuartii), northern brown bandicoots (Isoodon macrourus), domestic cats (Felis catus) and native birds (species as listed below) each preferred sheltered or vegetated habitats over open habitats, when compared to the introduced rats that showed little habitat preference. However, unlike the other species, the native birds used open areas more than vegetated or sheltered areas when compared within their group only. The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) was observed to use open areas comparatively more than the introduced rats, but used vegetated or sheltered habitats more when compared to self only. The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) used open areas more than vegetated or sheltered areas, when compared to the introduced rats, and against themselves. This indicated a level of coping with urban stressors by the native animals, but with a reliance on more vegetated habitats to allow for natural stress-relieving behaviours of escape or hiding. Here, we offer insights into how each of these findings may be used to help educate and motivate increased household responsibility for urban wildlife conservation.

AB  - Biodiversity in urban environments continues to decline, alongside diminution of human connections with nature and community. An integrated ethic and practice of caring for one's human and ecological community could help address these issues. Here, we describe how wildlife gardening can be such a pathway. We provide an overview of related social dynamics and benefits to human well-being, highlighting a case study that reveals an array of connections and well-being aspects derived from wildlife gardening, and their relationship with several activities, including time spent in the garden. We outline how positive biodiversity outcomes can be attained through habitat improvement in gardens, and describe how integration of nature and human community stewardship can function across physical and political boundaries when municipal governments and local communities work collaboratively. We contend that wildlife gardening conducted in this manner can involve urban residents in crafting and enacting an intertwined ethic and practice of caring for nature and humanity.

AB  - Research has demonstrated that residential yards can provide important habitat for urban birds, pollinators, and other wildlife. In addition, the motivations and constraints underlying decisions to manage traditional lawns, water-conserving yards, native plants, and other landscape types are well understood. Yet relatively little research has addressed people's decisions to adopt wildlife-supporting yards. Analyzing survey data from six U.S. cities, we address three related questions: 1) to what extent do residents choose yard features that support wildlife habitat?; 2) how do yard priorities and neighborhood governance, along with socio-demographic factors, explain the adoption of wildlife-supporting features?; and 3) how do residents who have already adopted wildlife-supporting yard features differ in their motivations from those who plan to adopt such features and those who do not? We found significant potential for adding vegetation (specifically shrubs and native plants) and other wildlife-supporting features to increase yard complexity and vegetation diversity. While gardening as a hobby was a significant motivator for people who have adopted wildlife yard features, the desire for low maintenance yards is a constraint among non-adopters. We therefore recommend promoting the planting of low-maintenance plant species or varieties that provide wildlife habitat but require little upkeep, especially among residents who would like to attract wildlife to their yards into the future. We also found that neighbourhood and homeowner associations increase the local adoption of wildlife-supporting yards. Coupled with other findings, our results underscore the importance of tailoring residential landscape features to diverse lifestyles while leveraging social institutions to expand wildlife habitat across urban and suburban neighborhoods.

AB  - The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are regarded as the key policy agenda for national, regional, and local government to combat climate change impacts and promote sustainable development. For example, in Perth and Peel metropolitan area, the capital city of Western Australia, there has been a shift of policy setting from that of a sprawling city to a denser city, while maintaining and promoting its ecosystem services and achieving sustainable city goals. Residential verge gardens have been widely adopted in recent years by communities and local governments in the Perth metropolitan area. This study reviews the motivations and drivers for the uptake of verge gardens in metropolitan suburbs and identifies potential policy responses. The City of Bayswater local government area was surveyed for this research. The study considers a mixed-methods approach, including site auditing and a questionnaire survey for local residents who have transformed their verges. A total of 534 verge gardens were audited on residential lots, and 166 valid questionnaire responses were received from residents. The site-audit of the verge gardens in Bayswater found that native vegetation is the dominant verge garden of choice, followed by the ornamental garden, with food production (plants/vegetables) seeming to be the least popular option. Regarding the motivations and drivers, the study has found that social (e.g., aesthetics, flowers, social interactions, and social mimicry), environmental (e.g., attracting wildlife and birds and environmental practice waterwise garden), and personal (easy maintenance) drivers are the primary motivators for residents to adopt verge gardens. Whilst the on-ground surveys were prior to COVID-19, the article includes how this topic could relate to pandemic-resilient urban spaces. As local governments look towards supporting the sustainable outcome goals, the observations of this study will be helpful for developing local government policy and community programs in the promotion and uptake of verge gardens in Australian cities.

AB  - Conserving water in California landscapes is critical due to a limited water supply, recurring droughts, and the energy use and costs of transporting water from northern to southern California due to a water distribution and population imbalance. Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD, Los Angeles, CA) spent more than $310 million between 2014 and 2016 on lawn removal rebates in an effort to conserve residential water. In some cases, cities and local water districts augmented MWD rebates with their own incentives. We conducted a web-based study of 1153 southern Californians who removed all or a portion of their lawns over the past 10 years to identify their motivation, satisfaction, landscape water use, and related maintenance practices. Results indicate that rebates were less important for most respondents than the desire to conserve water, improve landscape appearance, and reduce costs. There was a high correlation between the overall satisfaction with the lawn replacement process and the appearance of transformed landscapes, supporting earlier findings regarding the importance consumers place on landscape appearance. Results of this study are timely for providing guidance to policymakers and water districts regarding the cost-effectiveness of lawn removal rebates to conserve urban water. This study also highlights a need and opportunity for water districts and Cooperative Extension to provide irrigation training to residents of stand-alone homes who maintain their own landscapes. While 90% of respondents indicated they singly (78%) or jointly (12%) determine irrigation schedules rather than rely on a gardener or landscaper, only 18% indicated they base irrigation schedules on soil moisture content or soil texture (6%). There is also a need to provide education to water districts that incentivize the use of synthetic turf in hot inland and desert areas regarding potential high-temperature injury to humans, pets, and wildlife.

AB  - Urban areas are associated with high levels of habitat fragmentation. For some terrestrial species with limited climbing abilities, property boundaries can pose a significant problem by limiting access to residential gardens. The West European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) has declined markedly in the UK but is commonly found in areas of human habitation, including residential gardens. 'Hedgehog Street' is a public engagement campaign aimed at recruiting volunteers ('Hedgehog Champions') to create access points ('hedgehog highways') across garden boundaries to improve habitat connectivity. In this study, we used a series of questionnaire surveys to explore motivations for and obstacles to the creation of highways. Householders were more likely to have created a highway if they were already aware of the Hedgehog Street campaign, if their garden contained a high number of wildlife-friendly features and if they considered watching wildlife to be important. Hedgehog Champions created, on average, 1.69 highways each with 52.0% creating none; this would equate to an estimated >120,000 across all registered Champions. In comparison, 6.1-29.8% of non-Champions stated that they had made a highway. However, most highways had been created in boundaries that could already be traversed via naturally occurring holes: only 11.4% of garden boundaries could be traversed, and 3.2% of gardens accessed, just via a hedgehog highway. In addition, only 5.0% of gardens were considered totally inaccessible to hedgehogs. The most common reasons cited for not having made a highway were that householders' gardens were already accessible to hedgehogs followed by concerns relating to boundary ownership and / or communicating with neighbours. Future studies need to identify strategies for overcoming these obstacles to maximize citizen engagement, particularly with those householders who are not innately "wildlife-friendly", and to quantify the degree to which networks of highways affect patterns of individual movement and, ultimately, populations.

AB  - This paper analyzes land-system dynamics changes due to energy infrastructure development and explores the environmental and social ramifications of hydraulic fracturing, through a case study in Central Appalachia. Grounded in photographic data, satellite images, and ethnographic material, this study demonstrates landscape and embodied experiences of change over time. Data show major shifts in terms of wildlife behavior, possibilities for farming and gardening, and byproducts of construction like noise, pollution, and excavation. However, what we argue is crucial to examine is the emotional toll that these changes have taken on rural residents. Interviewees chose to live in West Virginia because of deep enchantment with the surrounding natural beauty, which they feel they have lost due to energy development. While energy research has been dominated by technical disciplines and explanations, we advocate for an emotional-oriented analysis that accounts for individually lived experiences in the context of these landscape-level changes.

AB  - Simple Summary The protection of pollinating insects depends on public support. Citizen science (CS) is frequently discussed as a way to promote interest and conservation action for pollinators. In cities, the drivers behind pollinator-friendly behaviour are largely unclear. We surveyed 111 community gardeners in Berlin and Munich, Germany, some of which were participating in a citizen science project. We created four different sets of generalized linear models to analyse how the gardeners' pro-pollinator behaviour intentions and behaviour were explained by the gardener's identity, emotions towards pollinators, attitudes towards pollinators and nature-relatedness. Respondents who were fascinated by pollinators, held positive attitudes, and felt joy about seeing pollinators reported intentions to protect or support pollinators. Similarly, joy about seeing pollinators was a predictor of participation in the CS project. We believe that CS may represent a pathway through which urban residents may become key actors in conservation projects within their nearby greenspaces. The conservation of pollinators requires social understanding to catalyse restoration action. Citizen science (CS) is discussed as a way to promote interest and action for pollinating insects. Yet, the drivers behind pro-pollinator behaviour are largely unclear, especially in urban areas. To better understand public engagement in pollinator conservation, we studied urban community gardeners' identity, nature-relatedness, emotions, and attitudes toward pollinators and their intentions to get involved in pro-pollinator behaviour in their gardening practice. We surveyed community gardeners in Berlin and Munich, Germany, some of which were participating in a citizen science project. In this scientific study, we created four different sets of generalized linear models to analyse how the gardeners' pro-pollinator behaviour intentions and behaviour were explained by socio-psychological factors. The responses of 111 gardeners revealed that gardeners that were fascinated by pollinators, held positive attitudes and felt joy about seeing pollinators reported intentions to protect or support pollinators, suggesting that fascination and joy can be harnessed for research and conservation on pollinators. Similarly, joy about seeing pollinators predicted participation in the CS project. We believe that CS may represent a pathway through which urban residents may become key actors in conservation projects within their nearby greenspaces.

AB  - The majority of the world's population now lives in cities, where reduced levels of native biodiversity, coupled with fewer opportunities for people to experience nature, are expected to result in an urban public increasingly disconnected from the natural environment. Residential gardens have great potential to both support native species and allow people daily contact with nature. Embracing the epistemological assumption that urban residents' interactions with nature in their gardens and parks may be complex, unpredictable, contradictory, and context-dependent, we used an interpretative phenomenological analysis approach to explore the human relationship with urban nature in a New Zealand city. We conducted 21 semi-structured "go-along" interviews to facilitate a deeper understanding of participants' personal experiences of nature in parks and gardens. Interviews revealed a tension between stated values and concrete actions affecting urban biodiversity in private gardens. This value-action gap stemmed from the multiple purposes and values that people hold for their gardens, which do not necessarily align with conservation of native nature. By recognizing that urban residents hold multiple values and want their gardens to fulfill multiple purposes, local authorities aiming to promote nature conservation in cities can design wildlife gardening programs that meet these multiple needs and reconcile conflicting priorities.

AB  - Despite growing interest in promoting urban biodiversity conservation, there are few concrete examples of how nature stewardship initiatives can be rapidly scaled, in number and across landscapes. This paper explores the factors that promote or inhibit the proliferation and impact of collaborations between citizens and their local governments that involve residents in municipal biodiversity conservation efforts in their gardens (wildlife gardening). We studied the Gardens for Wildlife Victoria network in Australia, which supports citizen-agency codevelopment of municipal wildlife gardening programs. In three years the network has expanded from one program to 39 initiatives in various developmental stages in 49% of the local government areas in the state of Victoria. Data are drawn from 21 semi-structured interviews of network participants running or developing programs in 12 municipalities, complemented by a survey of 33 network participants, and participants' evaluation of network workshops. We find that scaling occurs in four different domains of policy, values, locales and participants. Scaling is influenced by six interlinked factors: empowerment of actors; a civil-agency co-design and delivery model; conservation framing; links to and between landscapes and communities; resources - particularly time; and the network's role in promoting innovation and shared learning. Key barriers include short-term, topdown, and monetary agency foci; conservation framed as the principal domain of specialists and professionals; and prioritisation of listed species rather than local species more broadly. We present a framework for considering scaling of biodiversity stewardship and related factors.

AB  - Urban landscapes present substantial opportunities for biodiversity conservation with residential gardens offering some of the greatest potential conservation gains given that they represent a significant proportion of the total greenspace in urbanised landscapes. However, knowledge of wildlife ecology within gardens remains scarce, likely due to the difficulties associated with field ecologists accessing privately owned areas. Citizen-sourced data presents an alternative approach to typical field-based investigations and could be used to develop an extensive understanding of biodiversity within privately owned green spaces, providing concerns of data unreliability could be overcome. Here we i) examine the potential for urban householders to identify a threatened nocturnal mammal, in the presence of a similar non-threatened species, ii) examine which attributes can predict the level of accuracy in householders' species identifications and iii) investigate how their self-reported level of certainty affects identification reliability. We found up to 80% agreement between householders and experienced ecologists when we assessed presence and absence of nocturnal mammals on urban properties. The amount of time a householder had lived at their residence was a significant predictor of accuracy for mammal species identification, suggesting that familiarity with a site enhances the accuracy of citizen science data. Those people with a high level of certainty in their ability to correctly identify nocturnal mammals were no more likely to show higher species identification accuracy than those with low certainty. In urban areas, where ecological surveys for nocturnal taxa are especially challenging, our results inspire optimism that householders can add to the body of knowledge about biodiversity persisting in these landscapes, especially on properties where they have resided for at least one year.

AB  - Background Cuatrocienegas, part of the Chihuahuan Desert, is a region of unique biological, geological, geographical, and evolutionary importance. Its current population is mestizo; nevertheless, it has high national historical, cultural, and touristic relevance in Mexico. It has been cataloged as nationally significant for its flora and fauna by Mexican law, as well as being designated a High Protection site by the World Wildlife Fund and UNESCO. Because of its diverse and complex biological and sociocultural characteristics, we considered it important to determine, identify, and analyze various aspects of the traditional ethnobotanical knowledge and practices in this region. Methods Between 2016 and 2019, seven field trips were made to document the knowledge and use of flora. Cuatrocienegas is a protected area, collecting botanical material is regulated, so specimens were photographed and collected in neighboring communities, and in public and private gardens. Later permission was obtained to complete the collection of specimens (2019-2020). The plants were identified and entered into the flora database of the state of Coahuila, and deposited in the Herbarium of the Faculty of Forest Sciences, Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, Mexico. One hundred ten local residents (50 men and 60 women), aged between 27 and 91 years, were interviewed (semi-structured interviews). The cultural importance of ethnobotanical resources (cultural significance index) and its significance with respect to ethnobotanical richness in other Biosphere Reserves in Mexico (Mann-Whitney test), and similarities in the diversity of exotic species (Sorensen index) were studied. Results and discussion The ethnobotanical information registers 158 species and 132 genera in 57 vascular and non-vascular families, documenting a greater knowledge and use of cultivated species (84) with respect to wild species (74). The diversity of plants reported is compared to other ethnobotanical studies carried out in Mexican Biosphere Reserves. These results are highly relevant, in spite of unique exotic species. The people local pay special attention to medicinal and ornamental plants. The species that presented the highest use values are Larrea tridentata, Jatropha dioica, and Machaeranthera pinnatifida, three species characteristic of the desert region. Conclusions The particular diversity of wild flora in Cuatrocienegas Valley, combined with the varied introduced flora, is an important multifunctional resource. Special attention to introduced species is associated with harvesting use restrictions in the protected area as well as the high value of ornamental species that are difficult to maintain in desert areas. The extensive use of ethnobotanical knowledge is an example that biocultural diversity (at the conceptual level) is also strongly associated with socio-ecological systems incorporating mestizo groups and semi-urban rural landscapes, thus ceasing to be an exclusive focus of indigenous communities and regions.

AB  - A city's planted trees, the great majority of which are in private gardens, play a fundamental role in shaping a city's wild ecology, ecosystem functioning, and ecosystem services. However, studying tree diversity across a city's many thousands of separate private gardens is logistically challenging. After the disastrous 2010-2011 earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand, over 7,000 homes were abandoned and a botanical survey of these gardens was contracted by the Government's Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) prior to buildings being demolished. This unprecedented access to private gardens across the 443.9 hectares `Residential Red Zone' area of eastern Christchurch is a unique opportunity to explore the composition of trees in private gardens across a large area of a New Zealand city. We analysed these survey data to describe the effects of housing age, socio-economics, human population density, and general soil quality, on tree abundance, species richness, and the proportion of indigenous and exotic species. We found that while most of the tree species were exotic, about half of the individual trees were local native species. There is an increasing realisation of the native tree species values among Christchurch citizens and gardens in more recent areas of housing had a higher proportion of smaller/younger native trees. However, the same sites had proportionately more exotic trees, by species and individuals, amongst their larger planted trees than older areas of housing. The majority of the species, and individuals, of the larger (>= 10 cm DBH) trees planted in gardens still tend to be exotic species. In newer suburbs, gardens in wealthy areas had more native trees than gardens from poorer areas, while in older suburbs, poorer areas had more native big trees than wealthy areas. In combination, these describe, in detail unparalleled for at least in New Zealand, how the tree infrastructure of the city varies in space and time. This lays the groundwork for better understanding of how wildlife distribution and abundance, wild plant regeneration, and ecosystem services, are affected by the city's trees.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Zoological gardens in forest areas host a large diversity of vertebrate species (exotic and indigenous, free-living and captive, migrant and resident), resulting in an artificial proximity of animal species that would never share the same environment in natural conditions. The presence of mosquitoes enables the transmission of vector-borne pathogens, as is the case with avian malaria parasites. The mild infections in some bird species may become a serious threat to others that do not possess a natural resistance. Thus, the identification of the potential vectors of these parasites is important for future control of these agents, aiming at the bird species conservation. In this study, we collected over 2000 mosquitoes in Sao Paulo Zoo and analyzed them through molecular methods. Six different mosquito species yielded positive for the targeted parasite DNA. We demonstrated that these culicids had fed mainly on bird species and we reported three mosquito species that have never been previously incriminated as potential vectors of these parasites, enabling the use of more specific measures for vigilance and mosquito control.
   Avian malaria parasites are widespread parasites transmitted by Culicidae insects belonging to different genera. Even though several studies have been conducted recently, there is still a lack of information about potential vectors of Plasmodium parasites, especially in Neotropical regions. Former studies with free-living and captive animals in Sao Paulo Zoo showed the presence of several Plasmodium and Haemoproteus species. In 2015, a pilot study was conducted at the zoo to collect mosquitoes in order to find out (i) which species of Culicidae are present in the study area, (ii) what are their blood meal sources, and (iii) to which Plasmodium species might they be potential vectors. Mosquitoes were morphologically and molecularly identified. Blood meal source and haemosporidian DNA were identified using molecular protocols. A total of 25 Culicidae species were identified, and 6 of them were positive for Plasmodium/Haemoproteus DNA. Ten mosquito species had their source of blood meal identified, which were mainly birds, including some species that were positive for haemosporidian parasites in the former study mentioned. This study allowed us to expand the list of potential vectors of avian malaria parasites and to improve our knowledge of the evolutionary and ecological relationships between the highly diverse communities of birds, parasites, and vectors present at Sao Paulo Zoo.

AB  - Cities are important sites for encouraging more widespread adoption of pro-environmental behaviors (PEB) that benefit humans and wildlife alike. Wildscaping, a type of stewardship PEB in which people create wildlife friendly gardens, has been promoted by conservation organizations, yet fundamental questions remain about what wildscaping entails and what factors contribute to sustained involvement. We used a social-ecological systems (SES) framework to examine behavior change among urban residents in Colorado who had received wildscape gardening certification and training. We employed semi-structured interviews (n = 11), quantitative surveys (n = 63), participant observation, and document analysis, and analyzed data using grounded theoretical techniques. We found that program participants engaged in 14 gardening behaviors targeting habitat creation on their properties, and 11 advocacy behaviors targeting social change. These behaviors were driven by 10 interconnected motivations, including mutual refuge with wildlife, changing norms, aesthetic beauty, and sense of place. Engagement in wildscaping was sustained over time by multi-scalar contextual factors, including social interactions and formal program participation. These findings offer the first SES understanding of how urban residents begin and expand their engagement in wildscape gardening and advocacy. Future research should focus on how understanding of SES characteristics can enable more effective behavior change programs in urban landscapes. Possible ways that conservation outreach could consider SES include encouraging evolving feedback loops between participants' motivations and behaviors, emphasizing reciprocal benefits to individuals and their social-ecological context, and promoting coordinated involvement by different types of actors at multiple scales of the system.

AB  - How are our cities using nature-based solutions to confront the challenges posed by a warming climate, the loss of biodiversity and major resource depletion? This article discusses the opportunities and benefits of applying the concepts of regreening and rewilding of cities. The article engages with key sources and summarizes the background and development of regreening and nature-based solutions and important policies, concerns and perspectives of international and national organizations. It introduces the integration of nature-based solutions (NBS) as a strategy in urban planning with the aim to strengthen urban resilience and to slow down the biodiversity decline. Rewilding areas in cities has become a powerful strategy to bring back butterflies, insects, birds, and wildlife. In contrast to highly managed parks and gardens, these rewilding initiatives are leaving allotted spaces mostly uncultivated and self-regulated. Contact to nature is essential for human existence, urban wellbeing, and good quality of life. Green spaces in cities-big or small-all contribute to the health and wellbeing of residents. However, many cities do not offer residents easy access to green space within the city. Improving the better distribution of and access to green spaces and extending gardens and parks is likely to deliver a large number of benefits, such as: ecosystem services, better water management for enhanced urban flood control, slowing down the biodiversity loss, contributing to food security, and restoring damaged ecosystems. Furthermore, additional green space and NBS help to keep cities cool during heatwaves and improve the urban microclimate. Rewilding has emerged as an important part of new public parks and gardens. The next step is to up-scale citywide climate intervention strategies deployed to keep cities cool. However, as the discussion of this article shows, it is essential that the design of these NBS strategies is fully integrated with other complementary planning interventions and seeks synergies across all sectors.

AB  - Residential gardens in urban areas offer substantial opportunities for biodiversity conservation. To realize this opportunity, a comprehensive understanding of which species prosper in gardens, which mechanisms promote their use of these green spaces and how these mechanisms can be manipulated by residents to achieve conservation outcomes, is needed. While substantial progress has been made in evaluating the mechanisms that influence the diversity, presence, and abundance of wildlife in gardens, how these mechanisms vary seasonally is largely unknown. This study investigated whether the garden features influencing the presence and/or abundance of arboreal, flying, and ground-dwelling mammals in gardens varied seasonally using acoustic, trapping, and spotlighting surveys undertaken in four consecutive seasons (2018/19) in 52 gardens in southwestern Australia. As animal behavior and resource availability varies seasonally, we predicted that garden features influencing the presence and abundance of mammals in gardens would also vary seasonally. For arboreal and ground-dwelling mammals, we found that some garden features (e.g., canopy cover and presence of dogs, respectively) were important in more than one season; however, none were important in all seasons with most only being influential in one. No garden features predicted the presence of flying mammals in more than one season. Our results suggest that sampling in a single or few seasons may fail to identify features influencing wildlife at times other than in the season of sampling, or alternatively, may overemphasize factors that do not operate across all seasons. Studies that consider the mechanisms on a seasonal basis will provide a more comprehensive list of features influencing the presence and abundance of animals in gardens. We suggest it is both those features that support wildlife in multiple or all seasons, and those that support critical life-history events in a single season that could contribute to conservation if manipulated by residents appropriately.

AB  - Local regulations on residential landscapes (yards and gardens) can facilitate or constrain ecosystem services and disservices in cities. To our knowledge, no studies have undertaken a comprehensive look at how municipalities regulate residential landscapes to achieve particular goals and to control management practices. Across six U.S. cities, we analyzed 156 municipal ordinances to examine regional patterns in local landscape regulations and their implications for sustainability. Specifically, we conducted content analysis to capture regulations aimed at: 1) goals pertaining to conservation and environmental management, aesthetics and nuisance avoidance, and health and wellbeing, and 2) management actions including vegetation maintenance, water and waste management, food production, and chemical inputs. Our results reveal significant variation in local and regional regulations. While regulatory goals stress stormwater management and nuisance avoidance, relatively few municipalities explicitly regulate residential yards to maintain property values, mitigate heat, or avoid allergens. Meanwhile, biological conservation and water quality protection are common goals, yet regulations on yard management practices (e.g., non-native plants or chemical inputs) sometimes contradict these purposes. In addition, regulations emphasizing aesthetics and the maintenance of vegetation, mowing of grass and weeds, as well as the removal of dead wood, may inhibit wildlife-friendly yards. As a whole, landscaping ordinances largely ignore tradeoffs between interacting goals and outcomes, thereby limiting their potential to support landscape sustainability. Recommendations therefore include coordinated, multiobjective planning through partnerships among planners, developers, researchers, and non-government entities at multiple scales.

AB  - While urbanization is clearly contributing to biodiversity loss, certain wildlife assemblages can paradoxically be diverse and abundant in moderately developed areas. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that abundant anthropogenic resources for wildlife (i.e., food and shelter) outweigh the costs associated with urbanization. To test this hypothesis, we used camera traps to measure mammal species richness, diversity, and relative abundance (i.e., detection rate) in 58 residential yards in Raleigh, North Carolina, focusing on six types of features that might be used as resources: animal feeding, vegetable gardens, compost piles, chicken coops, brushpiles, and water sources. We also placed cameras at random control sites within each yard and sampled forests in nearby suburban and rural areas for comparison. We fit mixed-effects Poisson models to determine whether yard features, yard-scale characteristics, or landscape-scale landcover predicted mammal relative abundance for eight species. We also tested if the relative abundance of native canid predators in yards was related to the number of prey (rodents and lagomorphs). Species richness, diversity, and relative abundance of most mammal species was higher in yards and suburban forests than in rural forests. Within a yard, purposeful feeding had the strongest effect on animal relative abundance, with eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) being the most common (32.3 squirrels/day at feeders; 0.55 at control sites; 0.29 in suburban forests; and 0.10 in rural forests). We observed species using (e.g., eating) most yard features, although canids were less likely than other taxa to use resources in yards. The presence of a yard feature did not strongly affect the abundance of species at the control site in the yard, suggesting the influence of these features was highly localized. The relative abundance of predators had a positive association with prey relative abundance, and predators were less common in yards with fences. These results demonstrate that there is high use of anthropogenic resources, especially supplemental feeding by urban wildlife, and this increase in prey species may then attract predators, which supports the hypothesis that use of supplemental food resources explains the abundance of urban wildlife.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the biggest global threats to biodiversity. However, urban areas can offer opportunities for biodiversity conservation because of the assortment of resources and numerous taxa that occur in these habitats. While the use of gardens by animals is well documented, the ability of native fauna to exclusively use (i.e. reside in) them is largely uninvestigated and therefore constrains our current understanding of their conservation 'value'. We aimed to determine whether individuals of a threatened species can exclusively reside in gardens for several months of their life, and the frequency that novel resources (i.e. non-natural) are used compared to natural ones. We predicted that individuals captured in gardens would use both bushland and residential habitat, and use natural resources more frequently than novel resources because of the assumption that remnant habitat is more suitable than modified gardens. Using the Critically Endangered western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis) as a case study, we captured 20 individuals in gardens and radio-tracked them for a period of 95 +/- 3.3 days to determine their habitat use. Contrary to our predictions, for the duration of our study individuals exclusively resided within gardens, irrespective of proximity to bushland, and used novel resources more frequently than natural resources for all behaviours. We also found that over half (53%) of all the captured female possums had pouch young, and at the conclusion of the study, male possums were on average 43 g heavier. Our results exemplify that gardens can be of sufficient quality to support individuals, and that these modified habitats should be incorporated into conservation policy in urban landscapes. Given the extensive number of threatened species located within cities globally, our finding that a threatened species can reside exclusively within gardens further highlights the conservation opportunity that residential landscapes and cities offer wildlife.

AB  - Urban biotic homogenization is expected to be especially important in residential yards, where similar human preferences and management practices across environmentally heterogeneous regions might lead to the selection of similar plant species, closely related species, and/or species with similar sets of traits. We investigated how different yard management practices determine yard plant diversity and species composition in six cities of the U.S., and tested the extent to which yard management results in more homogeneous taxonomical, phylogenetic, and functional plant communities than the natural areas they replace or than relatively unmanaged areas at the residential-wildland interface ("interstitial" areas). We categorized yards based on fertilizer input frequency and landscaping style: high-input lawns, low-input lawns, and wildlife-certified yards. We defined homogenization as decreased average beta-diversity and decreased variance in alpha-diversity in yards when compared to natural and interstitial areas. We found that all residential yard types regardless of their management were functionally more homogeneous for both alpha- and beta-diversity than the natural and interstitial areas. Nevertheless, wildlife-certified yards were functionally more similar to natural areas than lawn-dominated yard types. All yard types were also more homogeneous in phylogenetic alpha-diversity compared to natural and interstitial areas, but more heterogenous in taxonomic alpha-diversity. Within yards, taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity were weakly correlated, highlighting the importance of examining multiple dimensions of biodiversity beyond taxonomic metrics. Our findings underscore the ecological importance of gardening practices that both support biodiversity and create residential plant communities that are functionally heterogeneous.

AB  - Urban environments offer substantial opportunities for wildlife conservation as they commonly overlap the distribution of native species and comprise structurally complex and diverse habitats. Conservation strategies within urban environments currently focus on enhancing or maintaining natural remnant vegetation despite the variety of smaller greenspaces that are known to support wildlife. Residential gardens in particular comprise a major component of the total greenspace in urban areas and offer numerous resources that can be used by multiple taxa, and may therefore represent an important, yet unrealised opportunity for conservation. In this study we aimed to further the understanding of the potential value of gardens for biodiversity conservation by comparing the diversity, presence, abundance and reproductive activity of mammals in gardens to natural urban bushland remnants. We demonstrate that gardens support a similar diversity of native mammals as urban bushland and that the presence, abundance and reproductive activity for most native mammals was similar in both bushland and gardens. With the exception of domestic pets, the presence and abundance of introduced species was not higher in gardens compared to urban bushland. Our study highlights that the potential role of residential gardens for biodiversity conservation should not be overlooked. Given that novel urban ecosystems will continue to expand, inclusion of gardens in wildlife conservation and management actions is likely to greatly increase our ability to conserve wildlife in urban habitats.

AB  - Background. In European and North American cities geese are among the most common and most visible large herbivores. As such, their presence and behaviour often conflict with the desires of the human residents. Fouling, noise, aggression and health concerns are all cited as reasons that there are "too many". Lethal control is often used for population management; however, this raises questions about whether this is a sustainable strategy to resolve the conflict between humans and geese when, paradoxically, it is humans that are responsible for creating the habitat and often providing the food and protection of geese at other times. We hypothesise that the landscaping of suburban parks can be improved to decrease its attractiveness to geese and to reduce the opportunity for conflict between geese and humans.
   Methods. Using observations collected over five years from a botanic garden situated in suburban Belgium and data from the whole of Flanders in Belgium, we examined landscape features that attract geese. These included the presence of islands in lakes, the distance from water, barriers to level flight and the size of exploited areas. The birds studied were the tadornine goose Alopochen aegyptiaca (L. 1766) (Egyptian goose) and the anserine geese, Branta canadensis (L. 1758) (Canada goose), Anser anser (L. 1758) (greylag goose) and Branta leucopsis (Bechstein, 1803) (barnacle goose). Landscape modification is a known method for altering goose behaviour, but there is little information on the power of such methods with which to inform managers and planners.
   Results. Our results demonstrate that lakes with islands attract more than twice as many anserine geese than lakes without islands, but make little difference to Egyptian geese. Furthermore, flight barriers between grazing areas and lakes are an effective deterrent to geese using an area for feeding. Keeping grazing areas small and surrounded by trees reduces their attractiveness to geese.
   Conclusion. The results suggest that landscape design can be used successfully to reduce the number of geese and their conflict with humans. However, this approach has its limitations and would require humans to compromise on what they expect from their landscaped parks, such as open vistas, lakes, islands and closely cropped lawns.

AB  - Human-wildlife interactions are believed to be increasing worldwide, and a number of studies have analyzed the risks posed by larger carnivores. However, people can also perceive smaller species of carnivores as threatening, particularly in urban areas. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) started to colonize British cities in the 1930s, and there is growing public concern about foxes biting people, particularly babies. These events are generally described in the press as attacks and generate intense media coverage and speculation that foxes view human infants as potential prey. Because foxes rely primarily on auditory cues for hunting, we conducted acoustic playback experiments in the gardens of 15 residential houses in northwest Bristol, United Kingdom, in December 2015 and 11 gardens from May to June 2016 to determine whether urban foxes were attracted to infant distress calls (cries). Foxes were not more likely to be attracted to infant cries or laughs than silence, although a minority of foxes cautiously approached and contacted the source of both types of infant vocalization. Their behavior appeared to be investigative rather than aggressive or predatory. Our review of the incidents reported in the British media showed that most people were bitten or scratched while sleeping, and adults were more likely to be bitten than children. The nature of the interactions and the wounds inflicted suggest that the foxes were using their mouth or forefeet to investigate an unusual object. Most incidents occurred inside people's homes, even though it is unusual for foxes to enter houses. The data suggested that incidents where people were bitten were chance events, possibly involving a particularly bold fox. To minimize the risk to the public, more quantitative data are required on the age, social status, and health of the foxes that enter houses and those that bite people.

LA  - Spanish
AB  - In the wildlife refuge Pantanos de Villa, habitat preferences of resident and migratory birds were analyzed according to the seasonality of 211 species of birds, of which 97 were residents, 82 migratories and 32 occasional visitors. According to use of habitats: 80.1% of species live on any of these wetlands, 40.8% in the marine coast, 37.9% in parks and gardens, 33.2% in wetlands and the beach, 34.1% in wetlands and parks and gardens and 1.0% in marine sandy beach and parks and gardens. Higher species similarity was between those living in "shrubland zones" and "parks and gardens" (82.3%). Fluctuation intensity of the species richness varied according to their occupance habitats, with the highest value observed between March and May in the water bodies (25) and marine coast (24). Management of the Pantanos de Villa must prioritize maintenance of heterogeneity of habitats because the low similarity degree would show species exclusivity of each of them. Comparisons between preferences of habitats of birds and plants would demonstrate the need of consider more than one taxa in decision-making for the management and conservation of biodiversity of coastal wetlands.

AB  - Simple Summary Red foxes are a well-established species of urban ecosystems in the UK and worldwide. Understanding how foxes use urban landscapes is important for urban biodiversity and disease management. The Resource Dispersion Hypothesis (RDH) proposes that home range size is smaller in larger, better quality habitats and increases as such habitats become patchier. Here, we tested the RDH for foxes in the city of Brighton and Hove, focusing on predominantly residential areas, as foxes are reported to prefer residential gardens to other urban habitats. We compared fox range size according to extent of garden land cover and varying garden size and configuration. We tracked 20 foxes (12 males and 8 females) with satellite collars recording at 15 min intervals for several weeks over four seasons to determine their range size and internal structure. We then measured garden size and configuration within fox ranges using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We found that foxes had smaller ranges in areas containing few, large, well-connected gardens and larger ranges where numerous smaller gardens were crisscrossed by internal barriers (e.g., fences, walls) or fragmented by other habitats. Our findings confirm the RDH, showing that habitat dispersion can be used to predict fox movement in cities with relevance to urban planning. Red foxes are a well-established species of urban ecosystems in the UK and worldwide. Understanding the spatial ecology of foxes in urban landscapes is important for enhancement of urban biodiversity and effective disease management. The Resource Dispersion Hypothesis (RDH) holds that territory (home range) size is linked to distribution and richness of habitat patches such that aggregation of rich resources should be negatively associated with range size. Here, we tested the RDH on a sample of 20 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes)in the city of Brighton and Hove. We focused on residential garden areas, as foxes were associated with these in previous studies. We equipped 12 male and 8 female foxes with GPS collars recording at 15 min intervals during discrete seasons over four years. We regressed fox core area size against garden size, number of garden patches, and edge density within and between patches as extracted from GIS in a series of bivariate linear mixed models. We found that foxes used smaller core areas where gardens were large and well-connected and larger core areas where numerous, smaller gardens were fragmented by internal barriers (e.g., fences, walls) or bisected by other habitats such as managed grassland or built-up areas. Our findings confirm the RDH and help to inform future urban planning for wildlife.

AB  - Urban areas provide small carnivores with an abundance of resources and reduced predation risk, resulting in higher population densities. Urban animals tend to have greatly reduced home range sizes in response to increased resource availability. We investigated the home range size of yellow mongoosesCynictis penicillatain an urban area and determined whether their home ranges overlapped with human residential areas. We studied the home range sizes of 8 collared and GPS tracked individuals in the Meyersdal Nature Area in South Africa; an area divided into two residential wildlife estates (4 individuals per estate): an Eco-Estate that was a built up residential area interspersed with natural areas; and a Nature Estate with reduced contact between animals and human residential areas. We used three methods to calculate home range size, namely Minimum Convex Polygon, Kernel Density Estimates and Local Convex Hull. Home range size was slightly larger in the Nature Estate, and male home ranges were larger than those of females. Compared to previous studies, home range sizes were considerably smaller in our study. Seasonal variation in home range could not be statistically compared, but, similar to non-urban populations, we observed smaller home range sizes during the breeding season (winter and spring) and larger sizes during the non-breeding season (autumn and summer). The overlap of home ranges with residential areas, and the record of multiple GPS fixes of tracked individuals within human residential gardens, was evident in both estates but to a greater extent in the Eco-Estate. Seasonal overlap with residential areas was greatest during autumn and winter. We showed that yellow mongooses modify their home ranges in response to urbanisation, which might be a consequence of abundant and easily accessible available resources, particularly during colder periods.

AB  - Many stressors plague bee populations including habitat fragmentation and degradation, as well as pathogens and pesticide exposure. With bee communities at risk, conservation efforts are imperative. Although recent research has examined bee communities across cities, few studies have analyzed variation in human attitudes toward and perceptions of bees, or how these perspectives might influence bee conservation. We therefore analyzed residents' attitudes toward and perceptions of bees, specifically in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. Primarily drawing upon 2017 survey data (n = 496, 39% response rate), we posed the following questions: 1) What cognitive, environmental, and social factors explain whether people like or dislike bees? and 2) How do attitudes and perceptions about bees relate to land management practices, specifically landscaping choices, herbicide and pesticide use, and desert plantings? Overall, attitudes toward bees were mostly neutral with a slight trend toward dislike but most residents did not believe bees were problematic at their homes. Additional findings reveal that risk perceptions, ecological worldviews, and pet ownership significantly explained attitudes toward bees. Moreover, people who live closer to desert parks had relatively positive attitudes toward bees. Regarding yard management practices, both attitudes toward and perceptions of bees were positively correlated with adding desert plants to residential yards. Moreover, people who use pesticides had more negative attitudes toward bees. Our results indicate conservation potential for urban bee populations, for example, by planting native vegetation in residential areas near desert preserves. We hope this study will result in more attitudinal research on bee species and other understudied urban wildlife.

AB  - Interactions with nature can improve the wellbeing of urban residents and increase their interest in biodiversity. Many places within cities offer opportunities for people to interact with wildlife, including open space and residential yards and gardens, but little is known about which places within a city people use to observe wildlife. In this study, we used publicly available spatial data on people's observations of birds from three online platforms-eBird, iNaturalist, and Flickr-to determine where people observe birds within the city of Chicago, Illinois (USA). Specifically, we investigated whether land use or neighborhood demographics explained where people observe birds. We expected that more observations would occur in open spaces, and especially conservation areas, than land uses where people tend to spend more time, but biodiversity is often lower (e.g., residential land). We also expected that more populated neighborhoods and those with higher median age and income of residents would have more bird observations recorded online. We found that bird observations occurred more often in open spaces than in residential areas, with high proportions of observations in recreation areas. In addition, a linear regression model showed that neighborhoods with higher median incomes, those with larger populations, and those located closer to Lake Michigan had more bird observations recorded online. These results have implications for conservation and environmental education efforts in Chicago and demonstrate the potential for social media and citizen science data to provide insight into urban human-wildlife interactions.

AB  - Understanding the factors that influence biodiversity in urban areas is important for informing management efforts aimed at enhancing the ecosystem services in urban settings and curbing the spread of invasive introduced species. We determined the ecological and socioeconomic factors that influence patterns of plant richness, phylogenetic diversity, and composition in 133 private household yards in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul Metropolitan area, Minnesota, USA. We compared the composition of spontaneously occurring plant species and those planted by homeowners with composition in natural areas (at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve) and in the horticulture pool of species available from commercial growers. Yard area and fertilizer frequency influenced species richness of the spontaneous species but expressed homeowner values did not. In contrast, the criteria that homeowners articulated as important in their management decisions, including aesthetics, wildlife, neatness and food provision, significantly predicted cultivated species richness. Strikingly, the composition of plant species that people cultivated in their yards resembled the taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of species available commercially. In contrast, the taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of spontaneous species showed high similarity to natural areas. The large fraction of introduced species that homeowners planted was a likely consequence of what was available for them to purchase. The study links the composition and diversity of yard flora to their natural and anthropogenic sources and sheds light on the human factors and values that influence the plant diversity in residential areas of a major urban system. Enhanced understanding of the influences of the sources of plants, both native and introduced, that enter urban systems and the human factors and values that influence their diversity is critical to identifying the levers to manage urban biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB  - Urbanisation threatens biodiversity globally, yet some animal populations persist within urban landscapes. Conservation of urban wildlife has prioritised parks and remnant bushland as critical habitat and neglected the role that residential gardens offer for conservation. We explored the potential for residential gardens to assist the conservation of mammals using an online questionnaire administered to residents of two case study cities in Australia to identify how widespread mammals in cities can be, which garden features promote mammal presence, and if the features varied among species with different habitat requirements. From 649 responses we found that three mammal species with different habitat requirements occurred in residential gardens throughout the city landscape. Garden features promoting mammal presence were consistent with broad ecological and habitat requirements of each species, but differed among both species and regions. Our study demonstrates that residential gardens offer a valuable habitat for mammals, and that garden features could be manipulated to promote use of gardens by these species. By considering gardens in urban planning and management actions aimed at conserving urban wildlife, residential gardens offer additional habitat to parks, roadside vegetation and urban bushland, and can play a significant role in biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Healthy soils are good for sustainable landscape and for the environment protection. Its protect wildlife, allow water infiltration, reduces soil erosion. allow carbon sequestration from the atmosphere, ensure the growth of trees. These functions are disturbed if the soil drainage is not ensured due to the strong compaction or to the presence of artefacts (bricks, concrete. plastic and others). Frequently, the soils in the individual gardens are highly compact in the underlying layer at about 20 cm deep. Top soil is usually loose because the setting up of the gardens in the residential buildings occurs by levelling of land surface and cover it with fertile soil brought from other locations. After carrying out field investigations we, found that the fertile soil material used to cover the land surface is not sufficient to ensure growth of all species in individual gardens. The results obtained during the investigations made it possible to develop a useful diagram for the identification of the owners of the dwellings and the gardens of the areas where the soil properties are deficient and some measures necessary to reduce the restrictions fir plant growth.

AB  - Context Tree canopy connectivity is important for supporting biodiversity. In urban landscapes, empirical examinations of habitat connectivity often overlook residential land, though yards and gardens often comprise a large portion of urban forests. Objectives We quantify structural composition (patches and paths), connectivity and fragmentation of an entire tree canopy network spanning 1220 Boston's neighborhoods to assess the configuration of the urban forest potentially affecting tree-dependent wildlife species, such as some birds and arboreal mammals. Methods The urban landscape was classified by land use, and residential yards were further subdivided into front yards, backyards, and corner yards. Structural composition, connectivity and fragmentation of the tree canopy was assessed using morphological spatial pattern and network analysis. Canopy metrics were then related to the land use of 349,305 property parcels. Results Back yard tree canopy cover was 65.23%. The majority of canopy links were on residential land (60.95% total), and particularly in backyards. Back yards contained the highest number of canopy fragments (48.65% total). Fragmentation of the canopy network peaked at similar to 23% of total canopy cover. Canopy fragmentation, distance among patches and their shape complexity were lower in neighborhoods with more tree canopy. Conclusions The important role that yards have in sustaining canopy connectivity across urban landscapes poses challenges and opportunities. Urban land management and planning need to protect connectivity links within urban forests when located on private residential realm. A prioritization strategy aimed at expanding urban tree cover could focus on yards to ensure that urban landscape connectivity is maintained and increased.

AB  - The epidemiological cycle of zoonotic phlebotomine-borne Leishmania infantum is a complex system in which domestic animals and wildlife interact and participate in its maintenance and transmission. In this study, we combined entomological surveillance, xenomonitoring of L. infantum and identification of host feeding sources of engorged females to investigate the potential contribution of a periurban wildlife park to leishmaniosis in neighbouring residential areas. Overall, 7,309 sand flies were collected in 111 trap-days during the summers of 2016-2018 in an endemic area in south-east Spain. Five different sand fly species were captured, with Phlebotomus perniciosus, the main L. infantum vector in this region, representing the most common species. Sand fly distribution was spatially heterogeneous in terms of species, sexes and female physiological stage (unfed, gravid and engorged females) and related to host distribution and management, and environmental features. None of the 602 sand flies analysed for L. infantum infection by kinetoplast real-time PCR were positive. We used molecular tools to identify the vertebrate hosts of sand flies and identified 17 host species, mainly mammals. Human DNA was not identified in engorged sand flies. This study provides evidence that wildlife parks in south-east Spain are ideal grounds for sand fly vectors but do not necessarily increase L. infantum infection risk to humans and dogs living in surrounding residential areas. This is probably because vectors feed mostly on non-L. infantum competent hosts and this should be investigated for a better understanding of the contribution of wildlife parks to the local epidemiology of L. infantum.

AB  - Traditional methods of assessing human-animal interactions include questionnaires or targeted interviews. More people typically use the internet as their primary source of information and now the availability and ease of collecting data from internet search terms mean that patterns of human-animal interactions can be assessed. In this study, internet search data of human-red fox interactions were analyzed for annual and monthly patterns. In general, patterns of internet searches were highest during April-August, reflecting key events for foxes such as denning and cub rearing. Increased searches for human-fox conflict solutions during this same period may also reflect changes in human behavior (e.g., increased garden usage). Annual increases in some search terms suggested an increasing awareness of foxes and problems with the species. This study shows that internet searches can show clear seasonal patterns that are associated with important periods of species biology.

AB  - Ornamental plants and relevant horticulture practices provide essential environmental, economic, social, and aesthetic benefits for human wellbeing. However, the contribution of ornamental plants-based ecosystem services (ESs) to human wellbeing (HWB) has not yet been explored in detail. This study was carried out with the aim of contributing to this knowledge gap. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between ornamental plants based-ESs and HWB in a home garden context in Lefke Region of North Cyprus. The objectives of the study were (i) to identify the ornamental plant species cultivated in the home gardens, (ii) to evaluate the major ornamental plants-based ESs, (iii) to assess the contributions of the relevant ESs to the HWB, and (iv) to examine the interrelationship between the different categories of ESs and HWB. The conceptual framework of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and a social preference valuation approach were adopted to assess the ornamental plants-based ESs, their contributions to the components of HWB, and interrelations amongst them. A number of qualitative (e.g. semi-structured interviews) and quantitative (e.g. a questionnaire) research tools were employed to collect the relevant data. The quantitative data obtained from 170 residents were evaluated using a 0-5 Likert Scale. The field surveys revealed that the composition of ornamental plants in the home gardens consists of 233 plant species. Evaluation of the quantitative data showed that the average relative value of the ornamental plants-based ESs varies between the categories of habitat-based ESs (4,08 points) and regulating ESs (3,00 points). This finding indicates the significant role of ornamental plants for 'habitat formation' and 'wildlife attraction'. The most tagged components were 'habitats for pets' and 'aesthetic quality'. The ornamental plants-based ESs particularly contribute to the two components of HWB: 'security' (4,51 points) and 'contact with nature' (4,37 points). The relationship between the ESs and HWB was quantified on a 1-5 Likert scale. A high degree of correlation was found between the categories of 'provisioning services' and 'basic material for a good life' and also between the categories of 'cultural services' and 'development of good social relations' with a 4,96 points. The lowest degree of correlation was estimated to be between the categories of 'regulating services' and 'development good social relations' with a 1,01 points. The results of this study may contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between the ornamental plants-based ESs and HWB in Lefke Region and elsewhere.

AB  - Context Urbanization can affect the density of hosts, altering patterns of infection risk in wildlife. Most studies examining associations between urbanization and host-parasite interactions have focused on vertebrate wildlife that carry zoonotic pathogens, and less is known about responses of other host taxa, including insects.
   Objectives Here we ask whether urban development predicts infection by a protozoan, Ophyrocystis elektroscirrha, in three populations of monarchs (Danaus plexippus): migratory monarchs in northeastern U.S., non-migratory monarchs in southeastern coastal U.S., and non-migratory monarchs in Hawaii.
   Methods We used impervious surface and developed land cover classes from the National Land Cover Database to derive proportional measures of urban development and an index of land cover aggregation at two spatial scales. Parasite data were from previous field sampling (Hawaii) and a citizen science project focused on monarch infection in North America.
   Results Proportional measures of urban development predicted greater infection prevalence for non-migratory monarchs sampled in the southern coastal U.S. and Hawaii, but not in the northern U.S. Aggregations of low intensity development, dominated by single-family housing, predicted greater infection prevalence in monarchs from the northern and southern coastal U.S. populations, but predicted lower infection prevalence in Hawaii.
   Conclusions Because natural habitats have been reduced by land-use change, plantings for monarchs in residential areas and urban gardens has become popular among the public. Mechanisms that underlie higher infection prevalence in urban landscapes remain unknown. Further monitoring and experimental studies are needed to inform strategies for habitat management to lower infection risk for monarchs.

AB  - Across Europe, hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) appear to be in decline in both urban and rural landscapes. Current methods used to monitor urban populations are, however, associated with several potential limitations. In this study, we conducted hedgehog footprint-tunnel surveys in 219 residential gardens across Reading, UK between May-September in 2013 and/or 2014; gardens were surveyed for five continuous days. Single-species occupancy models were used to investigate factors influencing hedgehog occupancy and two-species occupancy models were used to estimate a species interaction factor (SIF) between hedgehogs and (a) badgers (Meles meles), (b) foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and (c) dogs (Canis familiaris). The five-day survey protocol was associated with a false-absence error rate of 0.1-0.4%, indicating that it was a reliable method for determining hedgehog presence; conversely, 34.7% of householders were not able to correctly predict hedgehog presence or absence. Hedgehogs were widely distributed across Reading, but detected in only 32-40% of gardens. None of the within-garden or outside-garden factors investigated significantly affected hedgehog occupancy in the single-species models, but the two-species models indicated that badgers (SIF=0.471 +/- 0.188), but not foxes (SIF=0.954 +/- 0.048) or dogs (SIF=0.780 +/- 0.228), negatively affected the presence of hedgehogs in gardens, although not significantly. Overall, footprint-tunnels represent a viable field method for monitoring urban hedgehog populations, however, other approaches are required to identify factors that make gardens hedgehog friendly.

AB  - The conflict between humans and wild animals is a special type of phenomena between human development and wild animal conservation, not only leading to massive economic loss to local residents, but also imposing severe impacts upon the production and living activities and even personal safety of the residents. Human-elephant conflict has existed as a phenomenon of human settlement development for more than 20 years in Xishuangbanna, China. There are periodic incidents of wild elephants hurting/killing people as well as feeding on and destroying subsistence and cash crops. It is an increasingly urgent and important issue for China to resolve while protecting and managing Asian elephants. Our study employed an Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis model to perform a risk assessment of areas where the Asian elephant currently is distributed and to predict future risks. It employed a Circuit Theory model based on random walk theory to predict multiple potential movement or migration pathways of Asian elephants within Xishuangbanna. The results indicated that: (1) the regions with human-elephant conflict risk in Xishuangbanna Prefecture had an area of about 4349.08 km(2), accounting for 22.77% of the total prefecture area, with the risk regions primarily present in the middle and north parts of Menghai County and Jinghong City and in Mengla County in which there was a wide geographical distribution covering from the south to the north; (2) The regions of agriculture and garden that were close to Asian elephant distribution and roads were likely occurring risk; (3) There were more potential movement paths of elephants within Mengyang and Menghai distribution regions, which indicated that the connection of these areas was better. While the potential movement paths of elephants within Mengla and Shangyong were little; (4) There were some potential movement paths between different distribution areas of Asian elephant, but the migration possibility of elephants in different distribution areas was decreasing due to natural barriers (Mengyang-Menghai has Lancang river) and discontinuous potential paths between Mengla and Shangyong. Additionally, we discussed that created ecological corridors between different natural reserves to allow more dispersal and gene flow of elephants and diminish conflict between human and elephant. We also put forward compensation suggestions in different risk area. We hope our analytical methods can be applied, improved and expanded to other areas with similar wildlife damage.

AB  - Urban agriculture is a unique form of agriculture that can provide fresh, local produce for urban residents, and may benefit biodiversity by decreasing the need to expand agriculture into natural areas as well as enhancing biodiversity in urban areas. However, although urban agriculture is also often cited as promoting biodiversity in urban areas, the extent of empirical evidence for such claims has not been studied. Here we systematically review the relationship between urban agriculture and biodiversity in the scientific literature. We strictly define urban agriculture as areas in cities that grow produce specifically for human consumption. We examined 148 papers from 2000 to 2017, of which only 24 studies fit our definition of urban agriculture, and of those, only 18 both involved urban agriculture and measured biodiversity. Of the studies that did measure biodiversity, some showed increases in diversity compared to urban vacant lots, but other showed no difference. Moreover, these studies were mostly focused on plants and invertebrates and were conducted almost exclusively in North America. In order to use the generalization that urban agriculture will have a positive influence on urban biodiversity, more studies will need to be conducted across a wider geographic range worldwide (particularly in developing countries in the tropics) and on a greater diversity of species and taxa (e.g., herpetiles, birds and small mammals). Such studies will likely increase in conservation importance as urban expansion and agricultural demands increase globally.

AB  - Urban environments are increasingly important for biodiversity conservation, but pet cats threaten wildlife therein, displaying nuisance behaviour such as hunting, fighting, fouling and urine spraying. In an attempt to empower landholders wishing to reduce cat incursions humanely, we tested the effectiveness of two ultrasonic cat deterrents (CatStop (c) and On-Guard Mega-Sonic Cat Repeller (c)).
   After confirming in arena trials that cats detect and respond negatively to an ultrasonic device, we tested both deterrents in 18 suburban gardens in Perth, Western Australia. Camera monitoring at foci of cat activity (e.g. fish ponds, property entry/exit points) occurred for two weeks before (Period 1: device off), during (Period 2: device on) and after (Period 3: device off) the activation of deterrents. Data included individual cat demographics and behaviours, number of cat detections per site per day per sampling period, the duration of cat activity, and detection of non-target species.
   Seventy-eight unique cats were detected at 17 of 18 garden sites (2-9 cats/garden). Over half the cats could be sexed (56.4%, with 65.1% males). Nearly 53.0% of cats were confirmed to be pets living nearby. Cats that were most active in period 1 (>= 100 s total activity duration) were classified as 'residents'; all others were 'peripherals'.
   Overall, the ultrasonic deterrents reduced the frequency of incursions into gardens by resident cats by 46%, while the duration of incursions was reduced by 78%. Cat activity declined significantly from period 1 (baseline) to period 2 for resident cats but not peripheral cats (50% reduction; p = 0.001), and remained depressed in period 3 for resident cats but not peripheral cats (p < 0.001). Peripheral cat activity remained at an unchanging low level across all three periods. Males were slightly more active than females over the experiment (p = 0.04), but sexes did not vary in response to deterrents (p > 0.05). Cats confirmed as owned (53% of cats) generated more activity than cats of unknown ownership status (p = 0.03), probably reflecting proximity of their residences to trial gardens. Both deterrent models had similar effects (p = 0.89).
   By allowing pets to roam, cat owners are complicit in cat nuisance. This requires public education. Ultrasonic deterrents offer a cost-effective, humane option to reduce incursions by unwanted cats. Ultrasonic deterrents will not prevent all incursions, but they reduce their frequency and duration. Reduced cat activity has flow-on benefits to wildlife across a variety of urban-suburban settings, including gardens and parks. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anthropogenic landscape features such as urban parks and gardens, landfills and farmlands can provide novel, seasonally reliable food sources that impact wildlife ecology and distributions. In historically migratory species, food subsidies can cause individuals to forgo migration and form partially migratory or entirely sedentary populations, eroding a crucial benefit of migration: pathogen avoidance through seasonal abandonment of transmission sites and mortality of infected individuals during migration. Since many migratory taxa are declining, and wildlife populations in urban areas can harbour zoonotic pathogens, understanding the mechanisms by which anthropogenic resource subsidies influence infection dynamics and the persistence of migration is important for wildlife conservation and public health. We developed a mathematical model for a partially migratory population and a vector-borne pathogen transmitted at a shared breeding ground, where food subsidies increase the nonbreeding survival of residents. We found that higher resident nonbreeding survival increased infection prevalence in residents and migrants, and lowered the fraction of the population that migrated. The persistence of migration may be especially threatened if residency permits emergence of more virulent pathogens, if resource subsidies reduce costs of infection for residents, and if infection reduces individual migratory propensity.

AB  - Many human populations are undergoing an extinction of experience, with a progressive decline in interactions with nature. This is a consequence both of a loss of opportunity for, and orientation towards, such experiences. The trend is of concern in part because interactions with nature can be good for human health and wellbeing. One potential means of redressing these losses is through the intentional provision of resources to increase wildlife populations in close proximity to people, thereby increasing the potential for positive human-nature experiences, and thence the array of benefits that can result. In this paper, we review the evidence that these resource subsidies have such a cascade of effects. In some Westernized countries, the scale of provision is extraordinarily high, and doubtless leads to both positive and negative impacts for wildlife. In turn, these impacts often lead to more frequent, reliable and closer human-nature interactions, with a greater variety of species. The consequences for human wellbeing remain poorly understood, although benefits documented in the context of human-nature interactions more broadly seem likely to apply. There are also some important feedback loops that need to be better characterized if resource provisioning is to contribute effectively towards averting the extinction of experience.

AB  - Landscape preferences shape decision-making and drive the ecological outcomes of urban landscapes. We investigate how people's landscape preferences are shaped by the green space context (public park vs private residential garden landscapes) and by physical features such as vegetation complexity. A postal questionnaire was sent to households near seven urban parks in Melbourne, Australia. Results showed that landscapes were grouped into four categories based on patterns of preference response. Landscapes with moderate vegetation complexity were placed in separate categories distinguished by green space context (parks vs gardens), while very simple and very complex landscapes were placed in different categories irrespective of green space context. Surprisingly, dense vegetation was highly preferred by respondents. As areas of dense vegetation also provide complex habitats for wildlife, this highlights the possibility of developing policies and designing landscapes that can benefit both people and nature.

AB  - This qualitative study explores how urban gardeners were supported to become land stewards through a wildlife gardening program in Melbourne Australia, and how this process occurred. From interviews of 16 program members in their gardens, the effects of program participation on reported gardening purpose and practice, and attachments to place, nature, and community, were investigated. Using inductive analysis, a stewardship development model was posited and compared to PEB change models. A first phase introduces participants to the purpose, activities, and support for land stewardship, and their potential role. A development phase follows where connections to place deepen; stewardship knowledge, competencies and activities strengthen; and commitment to stewardship increases through learning by doing, supported by rewarding results, validation, community involvement, and accessible resources. Private land stewardship values and practice can develop from wildlife gardening, a means to foster urban biodiversity while strengthening connections between residents and nature, place, and community.

AB  - Red foxes thrive in towns and cities, where much of their food is deliberately provided by humans. We studied fox foraging behavior using camera traps in residential gardens where householders regularly fed foxes. Predictable feeding patterns attracted foxes to gardens, females were more efficient foragers than males, and dominant foxes enjoyed priority access to food, so that subordinates had to adopt compensatory strategies. Understanding how foxes exploit resources may help address conflicts in urban areas. In patchy environments, foragers adopt different strategies to acquire resources depending on their internal state and external physical and social environment: this has important fitness consequences. Linking individual variation in patch use to tangible characteristics is key to understand many higher-level ecological processes. We studied patch use by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in the city of Bristol, UK. We placed camera traps in gardens where householders provisioned foxes (patches) to investigate whether 1) foxes discriminated between patches based on food availability, quantified as provisioning frequency (predictability) and the energy value of provisioned food; and 2) individual patch use varied with dominance, gender, and season. Increased frequency of provisioning encouraged more foxes to visit and to stay longer in patches. All foxes visited the most predictable patches first each day, but females were more selective and generally more efficient foragers than males. Females increased foraging effort during cub rearing, whereas males reduced patch use in the dispersal and mating season. Dominants and subordinates shared patches spatiotemporally, possibly facilitated by relatedness and familiarity between group members. However, dominants visited more food patches on their territory, spent more time in predictable patches and fed earlier than subordinates. Subordinates may compensate for competition by visiting patches of lower quality or outside their territory, which is inefficient and risky. Our results demonstrate gender differences in behavioral motivation, show how subordinates forego foraging efficiency to mitigate intra-group competition and reveal how human provisioning influences fox space use in urban areas.

AB  - Stormwater ponds are widely used in urban developments to control and clean stormwater and add aesthetic appeal to the landscape. This dual function of residential stormwater systems can create conditions at odds for the optimal performance of either function. This investigation sought to discover connections between aesthetics, plants, design, maintenance, and municipal codes as a means to improve water quality and stormwater pond appearance. To establish the connections between visual quality and environmental function, we conducted five focus groups, four interviews with landscape professionals, and reviewed regulatory codes for 46 municipalities. We concluded that homeowner preferences and the social influence of neighbors were closely linked to design, codes, and management issues. Insights gained include the shared social value of wildlife viewing and aesthetic preferences for diverse, but maintained shoreline planting.

AB  - A diversity of indigenous and alien wildlife persists in suburbia, and provides residents with the opportunity to experience wildlife. Suburban gardens may serve as refugia and foraging grounds for many primate species allowing them to populate within a largely urbanized landscape. However, this has led to the increasing human interactions with them, resulting in conflict. Our study investigated the perceptions of suburban residents towards urban vervet monkeys Cercopithecus aethiops pygerythrus within the Msunduzi and Ethekwini municipalities, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We assessed how these related to the monkeys' presence, activities and interactions in residential gardens, and the value of wildlife to residents. Assessment was conducted through an online questionnaire survey. General attitudes of residents to vervet monkeys were canvassed by assessing the respondents' level of active engagement in wildlife watching within their properties. We analyzed 603 surveys submitted online using logistic regression and ordinal regression models. We ascertained that vervet monkeys were disliked by 29% of residents due to their aggressiveness, destructive behaviour in gardens and households, and perceived threat to native wildlife. Frequency and duration of foraging vervet monkeys in residents' gardens was influenced by the presence of pet dogs, fruiting trees, tall trees (> 2 m), ratio of indigenous to alien vegetation of gardens, residency type, and active and passive food provisioning. Despite conflict, the majority of respondents appreciated urban wildlife (67%) and actively engaged in wildlife watching (88%), emphasizing the importance of incorporating human dimension values into the management of urban biodiversity. Our study highlights the value of citizen science in providing mechanisms for identifying priority management and conservation efforts at the highly complex human-wildlife interface in an urbanized landscape.

AB  - Although residential areas are often unfavourable for wildlife, some species can take advantage of the available shelter and anthropogenic sources of food such as supplementary feeding. The European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is increasingly associated with gardens and villages and less so with arable farmland. Suggested drivers for this include the following: hedgehogs' attraction to higher food densities, including natural prey and anthropogenic sources, a greater range of day nest sites and warmer microclimates in rural villages, coupled with decreased risk of predation by badgers (Meles meles). We investigated the contribution of these drivers by radio-tracking hedgehogs on four arable sites, two with badgers present. Seventy-eight hedgehogs were tracked, 32 yielding enough data to calculate home range sizes. At the home range and landscape scales, gardens and buildings were the highest ranked habitats compared with their availability. Woodland and arable land were the lowest ranked compared with their availability. Villages were the most selected habitat for nesting. When hedgehogs were found closer to buildings, their ranges were smaller and we speculate this is due to increased food availability in villages. Where badgers were present hedgehogs remained closer to cover and their home ranges were on average 12.2 ha smaller. On badger-occupied sites, 50% fewer radio-tracking fixes were on arable land. We conclude that resource availability coupled with nest site selection and badger presence drives hedgehogs' selection of rural villages. We found no effect of ambient temperature on habitat use. We recommend focusing conservation efforts on maintaining hedgehog populations in rural villages.

AB  - In sprawling metropolitan areas, residential landscaping is a major concern with respect to biodiversity conservation, and it could play a critical role in conserving wildlife habitat. In the United States, residential landscaping typically consists of maintained lawns with specimen plantings of non-native trees and shrubs; such designs provide poor habitat for urban wildlife species. We conducted a case study of Raleigh, North Carolina residents to determine how providing information about the benefits of native plant landscaping to bird species influenced urban residents' landscaping preferences. We used Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests to determine if respondent preferences for 0, 50, 75 and 100 % native plant landscaping coverages changed after residents were informed about the benefits that native plants provide for birds. Initially, the 50 % native landscaping coverage was most preferred by residents; however, preferences for all four native plant landscaping coverage designs were significantly different after the informational treatment. Neutrality changed to opposition for the 0 % native plant coverage, while opposition changed to support and neutrality for the 75 and 100 % native plant coverage designs, respectively. After the informational treatment, the 50 and 75 % native plant landscaping coverage had the highest mean preference levels, although the 100 % design was ranked first more than any other design. Our findings suggest that residential support for native plant landscaping is higher than is reflected by typical residential landscaping practices, and that dissemination of information regarding the benefits of native plant landscaping to birds could alter public preferences for native plant landscaping.

AB  - Complementary public and private conservation action is required to sustain native biodiversity in cities. Residents can contribute by wildlife gardening - removing environmental weeds, cultivating indigenous flora, and improving habitat in their gardens. There is currently little guidance about how best to involve residents in wildlife gardening and align their work with public land management. We explored how a purposively chosen wildlife gardening program in Melbourne, Australia engaged and supported residents to augment local government efforts to conserve indigenous biota. Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with program members to understand the program's impact on their gardening and their connections with their council and community. Unpublished Council survey data were used to position interview findings on wildlife gardening activities and the value of program features. Interviewees detailed how they modified their gardening to assist their council to conserve indigenous biota. Five program features were implicated in this change: (1) on-site garden assessment; (2) indigenous community nursery; (3) communication hubs; (4) a framework that fosters experiential learning and community linkages; and (5) endorsement of each garden's potential conservation contribution. Collaborative wildlife gardening programs can engage residents to manage their land to achieve landscape-focused conservation goals while building relationships with council and community.

AB  - The negative impacts of urbanization on biodiversity are well known, and the use of native vegetation in private gardens and streetscapes have been shown to improve the species richness and abundance of native wildlife, thereby improving the biodiversity of the local area. This study poses the question of whether the general public is interested in planting native species, to determine whether a cultural shift in garden planting style is feasible. A total of 3707 questionnaires relating to nature in the backyard were delivered to residents in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia with 417 responses received (11.2% response rate). The results indicate that the public perception of the aesthetic appeal of native gardens is fairly positive and that Melbournians have considerable interest in planting native species in residential gardens and that a large number would like wildlife in their yards. The paper concludes that there is scope to encourage the use of native plants in residential landscaping. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict is increasing as urbanization expands and wildlife species adjust to living near people. Translocation is often used to manage human-wildlife conflict because it is considered to be humane, yet fates of translocated animals are largely unknown. As an urban adapter, woodchucks (Marmota monax) are a common source of human-wildlife conflict due to their burrowing, foraging, and scent-marking behavior. We examined survival and movements of 27 nuisance woodchucks captured by a nuisance wildlife operator in the Chicago metropolitan area, radiomarked with internal transmitters, and translocated to exurban release sites mimicking typical practices. We also captured and radiomarked 16 resident woodchucks from the release landscape for comparison. Translocated woodchucks moved farther than residents immediately post release with no evidence of homing and most left the release site. Annual survival did not differ between translocated and resident woodchucks. However, survival was extremely low (0.18) compared to previous estimates for woodchucks, primarily due to high predation by coyotes (Canis latrans). Translocation should be used only when other nonlethal methods are ineffective (e.g., exclusion, removing food sources, selecting unpalatable plants for gardens). When necessary, the practice of translocation could be improved by reducing predation risk for translocated animals, either by selecting release sites with low predation risk, or by using soft-release methods, such as acclimation enclosures or artificial burrows.

AB  - Wildlife living in the suburbs faces the challenge of dealing with human presence and yard management (including the occurrence of pets) which vary at the scale of the house block. This study examined the influence of ecological factors (e.g. extent of grass and food availability) and anthropogenic factors (e.g. human activity and garden usage) on breeding site choice and reproductive success of the ground-nesting masked lapwing Vanellus miles on Phillip Island, Australia. Lapwings nested less frequently in residential properties (high levels of human usage) compared with vacant blocks and holiday houses. They were also more likely to breed on properties with high food availability and larger areas of grass. None of these variables influenced clutch size or the probability of eggs hatching, although larger clutches and higher hatching rates tended to be associated with more food. This study shows that, for an urban exploiting species, habitat quality is not homogenous at the scale of the house block, and that human activity is avoided by a species generally considered highly tolerant of people.

AB  - As urbanization increases, the identification of nest predators becomes important for avian conservation and management of urban wildlife communities. We investigated bird nest predation using artificial nests in urban areas of the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province of South Africa. From June 2013 through February 2014 we installed seventy-five artificial nests in 25 suburban gardens in the Ethekwini and Msunduzi municipalities of KZN. Euplectes spp. nests were used and baited with two quail-sized, hand-made, silicon eggs. These were placed in residential gardens and monitored by camera traps for 2-weeks in winter, spring and summer respectively. Generally bird nesting occurs throughout the year in KZN's subtropical climate, with some avoidance during the autumn season. Therefore, experiments were not conducted during autumn, as fresh nests were not available for use. Overall the rate of predation on artificial nests was 25 % (n = 19), with vervet monkeys Ceropithecus aethiops pygerythrus predating 20 % (n = 17) of the nests while domestic cats Felis catus predated 3 % (n = 2) of nests. Nest predation was significantly higher in the winter season, with 79 % of depredations occurring in winter (n = 15), 16 % in spring (n = 3) and 5 % in summer (n = 1), and in areas with less canopy cover. Our results suggest that vervet monkeys may have a negative impact on nesting birds in urban environments, however, in order to assess the rate of predation experiments on natural nests coupled with information on fledgling success is deemed necessary to investigate avian population declines.

AB  - Simple Summary: Mitigating the toll of roads on wildlife can become difficult when awareness and exposure does not result in willingness to change driving behaviour. Using a self-reporting questionnaire, we found that while most drivers view wildlife vehicle collisions as a serious issue, increasing exposure to collisions decreased this attitude and it did not translate into willingness to adopt additional mitigation strategies. In addition, despite most respondents stating they routinely drive slower when collision risk is high (at dusk and dawn), our assessment of driving trends via traffic speeds suggested this sentiment was not generally adhered to. We suggest that competing priorities and complacency when risk to people is low may adversely affect willingness to prevent collisions.
   Abstract: Most people in the world now live in cities. Urbanisation simultaneously isolates people from nature and contributes to biodiversity decline. As cities expand, suburban development and the road infrastructure to support them widens their impact on wildlife. Even so, urban communities, especially those on the peri-urban fringe, endeavour to support biodiversity through wildlife friendly gardens, green spaces and corridors, and conservation estates. On one hand, many who live on city fringes do so because they enjoy proximity to nature, however, the ever increasing intrusion of roads leads to conflict with wildlife. Trauma (usually fatal) to wildlife and (usually emotional and financial) to people ensues. Exposure to this trauma, therefore, should inform attitudes towards wildlife vehicle collisions (WVC) and be linked to willingness to reduce risk of further WVC. While there is good anecdotal evidence for this response, competing priorities and better understanding of the likelihood of human injury or fatalities, as opposed to wildlife fatalities, may confound this trend. In this paper we sought to explore this relationship with a quantitative study of driver behaviour and attitudes to WVC from a cohort of residents and visitors who drive through a peri-urban reserve (Royal National Park) on the outskirts of Sydney, Australia. We distributed a self-reporting questionnaire and received responses from 105 local residents and 51 visitors to small townships accessed by roads through the national park. We sought the respondents' exposure to WVC, their evasive actions in an impending WVC, their attitudes to wildlife fatalities, their strategies to reduce the risk of WVC, and their willingness to adopt new ameliorative measures. The results were partitioned by driver demographics and residency. Residents were generally well informed about mitigation strategies but exposure led to a decrease in viewing WVC as very serious. In addition, despite most respondents stating they routinely drive slower when collision risk is high (at dusk and dawn), our assessment of driving trends via traffic speeds suggested this sentiment was not generally adhered to. Thus we unveil some of the complexities in tackling driver's willingness to act on reducing risk of WVC, particularly when risk of human trauma is low.

AB  - Large parts of urban space around the world exist of small-scale plots such as domestic gardens. These small-scale urban spaces carry potential for enhancing biodiversity, sustainability and ecosystem services in and beyond cities. However, domestic gardening and residential garden designs are often guided by aesthetics and ease more than by the aim to create habitat and biological diversity. Yard-management decisions impact socio-ecological systems in various ways, for example through irrigation patterns, fertilization or the use of pesticides or through the choice for exotic species that may become invasive over time. Yard-management decisions can also positively influence the presence of pollinators, improve soil quality or even foster small scale 'Wildlife Habitats' that can function as ecological stepping stones to the wider environment. In this paper a pilot assessment is presented of the contribution of residential front-yards in Phoenix (Arizona) and Maastricht (The Netherlands) to biodiversity, ecosystem services and sustainability by applying the BIMBY (Biodiversity in My (Back) Yard) framework.

AB  - Context The conservation value of residential landscapes is becoming increasingly apparent in our urbanizing world. The ecological characteristics of residential areas are largely determined by the decisions of many individual "managers." In these complex socio-ecological systems, it is important to understand the factors that motivate human decision-making.
   Objectives Our first objective was to quantify wildlife resources and management activities in residential landscapes and compare vegetation in front and back yards. Our second objective was to test three hypotheses linked with variation in yards: socioeconomic characteristics, neighborhood design factors, and perceptions of neighborhood birds.
   Methods We conducted surveys of over 900 residents in 25 Chicago-area neighborhoods to examine the wildlife resources contained in front and back yards and the social factors associated with variation in yards. We used a multi-scalar approach to examine among-yard and among-neighborhood variation in residential landscapes.
   Results Results indicate that back yards contain more wildlife resources than front yards, including greater vegetation complexity, more plants with fruit/berries, and more plants intended to attract birds. Furthermore, different hypotheses explain variation in front and back yards. Perceptions of birds were most important in explaining variation in back yard vegetation and wildlife-friendly resources per parcel, while neighbors' yards and socioeconomic characteristics best explained front yard vegetation.
   Conclusions This study demonstrates the importance of back yards as an unexplored and underestimated resource for biodiversity. In addition, the results provide insight into the complex factors linked with yard decisions, notably that residents' connections with neighborhood birds appear to translate to on-the-ground actions.

AB  - A comprehensive approach to reducing landscape water use was implemented in the Demonstration Garden in the City of Hawthorne. By creating healthy soil, grading to capture and retain rainwater, using California native and climate-appropriate plants, and implementing sustainable maintenance practices, the garden was designed to mimic the natural processes of a mini-watershed. The soil is now able to soak up and retain rainwater, reducing the need for supplemental irrigation and eliminating urban runoff. Habitat and food for wildlife was introduced, and maintenance costs were minimized by reducing green waste and eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. The installation was supplemented by two classes offered free to the public: a three hour introduction to California Friendly Landscaping principles, and a half day hands-on workshop in which participants used their newly-acquired knowledge to plant California natives and install drip irrigation. California native plantings were selected for their long-lasting and colorful blooms to introduce the public to the beauty and diversity of California's indigenous flora, which has, until recently, been under-represented in garden centers and under-utilized in residential and commercial landscapes.

AB  - Objectives. We examined associations between specific public open space (POS) attributes and recreational walking to local POS.
   Methods. Between October 2004 and December 2006, 1465 adults of the RESIDential Environments Project, conducted in Perth, Australia, reported whether they walk to a POS for recreation. For each participant, we identified all open spaces larger than 0.8 hectares within 1.6 kilometers from home. On the basis of field audit data, we created 3 scores (presence, count, size-weighted presence) for 19 specific open space attributes.
   Results. With logistic regression analyses, we found that walking to a POS was associated with the presence of gardens, grassed areas, walking paths, water features, wildlife, amenities, dog-related facilities, and off-leash areas for dogs. It was also associated with the highest number of these attributes in a single open space, but not with the total number of attributes in all POSs within 1.6 kilometers of home.
   Conclusions. Building 1 high-quality local park may be more effective in promoting recreational walking than is providing many average-quality parks.

AB  - Australia's urban landscapes offer opportunities to marry socio-economic and biodiversity conservation objectives. Yet, information is needed on what urban landscape and habitat features are important for wildlife. In this article, we draw together our research from southeastern Australia to describe key lessons for biodiversity-sensitive cities and towns. Lesson 1: The effects of urbanization on wildlife extend into adjacent habitats. We recommend retaining large, undisturbed areas of habitat away from development, avoiding intensive development adjacent to important conservation areas, prioritizing areas of ecological and social significance, screening light and noise pollution at the urban fringe and around large nature reserves, and planting appropriately provenanced locally native species for public streetscapes, parks and gardens. Lesson 2: Strategic enhancement of urban greenspace offers biodiversity gains. We recommend increasing the total amount of greenspace cover, maintaining ecological structures as habitat islands, using landscaping techniques to minimize risks to human safety, and gardening with low-flowering native shrubs. Lesson 3: Large old trees need to be managed for long-term sustainability. We recommend retaining large old trees in new developments, increasing the maximum standing life of urban trees, protecting regenerating areas and planting more seedlings, supplementing habitat features associated with large trees, and ensuring that young trees have space to grow through time. Lesson 4: Education and engagement connects residents with nature and raises awareness. We recommend education programs to enhance opportunities for residents to experience and learn about biodiversity, engaging residents in the establishment and maintenance of wildlife habitat, providing 'cues to care', facilitating access to garden plants that benefit wildlife, and encouraging cat containment. These lessons provide an evidence-base for implementing conservation and management actions to improve the capacity of our cities and towns to support a diverse and abundant biota.

AB  - Feeding wild bird is popular in domestic gardens across the world, with around half of households in the UK, North America and Australia doing so. Nevertheless, there is surprisingly little empirical information on many aspects of the activity. We sought to characterise garden bird feeding in a large UK urban area in two ways. First, we conducted face-to-face questionnaires with a representative cross-section of residents. Just over half fed birds, the majority doing so year-round and at least weekly. Second, a 2-year, longitudinal study recorded all foodstuffs put out by households on every provisioning occasion. In this way, we obtained the first year-round quantitative records of the amounts and types of wild bird food provided in individual gardens. A median of 127 g, equivalent to 628 kcal, was given daily per household (typically consisting of several food types). We estimated the daily cost of this provisioning level to be UK 0.35 pound per household based on the relative proportions of each food type. Provisioning level was not significantly influenced by weather or season. Comparisons between the data sets revealed significantly less frequent feeding amongst the feeders in the longitudinal study (assumed to be 'keen' feeders owing to their participation in this long-term study and numbers of food types provided) than the face-to-face questionnaire respondents, suggesting that questionnaires relying upon participants' estimates rather than records of provisioning may overestimate actual provisioning frequency. Assuming 100% uptake, the median provisioning level equates to sufficient supplementary resources across the UK to fully support 196 million individuals of a hypothetical average garden-feeding bird species (based on 10 common UK garden-feeding birds' energy requirements). This compares with an estimated total of 71 million breeding individuals of these 10 species in the UK (non-breeding numbers unknown). Taking the lowest provisioning level recorded (101 kcal/day) as a conservative measure, 31 million of these average individuals could theoretically be supported.

AB  - Food availability is a primary driver of avian population regulation. However, few studies have considered the effects of what is essentially a massive supplementary feeding experiment: the practice of wild bird feeding. Bird feeding has been posited as an important factor influencing the structure of bird communities, especially in urban areas, although experimental evidence to support this is almost entirely lacking. We carried out an 18-mo experimental feeding study at 23 residential properties to investigate the effects of bird feeding on local urban avian assemblages. Our feeding regime was based on predominant urban feeding practices in our region. We used monthly bird surveys to compare avian community composition, species richness, and the densities of local species at feeding and nonfeeding properties. Avian community structure diverged at feeding properties and five of the commonest garden bird species were affected by the experimental feeding regime. Introduced birds particularly benefitted, with dramatic increases observed in the abundances of house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and spotted dove (Streptopelia chinensis) in particular. We also found evidence of a negative effect on the abundance of a native insectivore, the grey warbler (Gerygone igata). Almost all of the observed changes did not persist once feeding had ceased. Our study directly demonstrates that the human pastime of bird feeding substantially contributes to the structure of avian community in urban areas, potentially altering the balance between native and introduced species.

TI  - Feeding wild birds in gardens: A test of water versus food
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT & RESTORATION
LA  - English
AB  - Bird feeding in residential gardens is an increasingly popular human-wildlife interaction. In Australia, the practice is discouraged by most government and nongovernment wildlife conservation agencies, although advice varies and the most common recommendation is to provide water and habitat for birds rather than supplementary food. This study compares bird abundance and diversity when residents in a Melbourne municipality provide water for birds versus food. Bird abundance was greater when food was provided compared with water, but avian assemblages did not differ.

AB  - Urban development often affects resource availability in ways that can influence not only community structure, but key species interactions that shape population dynamics. Although some resources are unintentionally altered, others are deliberately changed to improve habitat for urban wildlife, particularly songbirds. We hypothesized that management strategies that encourage planting trees and shrubs (i.e. increasing woody cover) would inadvertently attract predators of bird nests, which are generally abundant within cities. To test this, we examined the relationship between percent woody cover, pooled across trees and shrubs, and diurnal activity patterns of nest predators in residential yards. We surveyed predator activity and characterized habitat using aerial imagery of seven suburban neighborhoods in Franklin County, Ohio during April-August 2011 and 2012. Predator activity varied widely among individual yards, but contrary to our hypothesis, the availability of woody cover at either yard or neighborhood scales was not a strong predictor of diurnal activity in yards for five common species of nest predators (Eastern gray squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis; common grackle, Quiscalus quiscala; brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater; blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata; and domestic cat, Fells catus). Thus, our study suggests that wildlife habitat management or gardening programs that recommend increasing woody cover do not necessarily attract some common predators of songbird nests in Midwestern landscapes. Additional research that identifies which habitat features beyond woody cover best predict nest predator activity will facilitate the creation of management recommendations that increase the conservation value of urban environments for songbirds.

AB  - Taeniid infections in intermediate hosts manifest themselves as extraintestinal larval stages which, in early development, lack species-specific characteristics. The inability to distinguish infections of zoonotic importance such as Echinococcus multilocularis from other taeniid infections that have mainly veterinary significance stimulated the development of species-specific molecular diagnostics. In this study, the prevalence of taeniid infections in potential intermediate hosts was evaluated using both morphological diagnosis and a newly described multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for species determination. Small mammals (N = 719) were trapped in three different types of habitats in north-east Zealand, Denmark. The sensitivity of the multiplex PCR (90.5%) exceeded that of morphological examination (57.9%) for identifying 95 taeniid infections. The use of the multiplex PCR resulted in higher prevalence rates due to improved detection of immature liver infections with Hydatigera taeniaeformis and Versteria mustelae, but did not affect the observed prevalence rates of peritoneal metacestodes of Taenia polyacantha. The prevalence of taeniid infections showed a significant difference according to habitat type, potentially identifying a 'sylvatic' transmission and an 'urban' transmission, with marked variation among different taeniid species. Versteria mustelae and T. polyacantha were more prevalent in rural forests, while infections with H. taeniaeformis were dominant in urban parks/forests and in residential and farm gardens. The multiplex PCR facilitated a better utilization of wildlife samples by yielding a higher number of definitive diagnoses of ambiguous taeniid infections in liver lesions, allowing for more accurate epidemiological data and, hence, a more accurate risk assessment.

AB  - Context As urbanisation continues to increase on a global scale, people are becoming increasingly distanced from nature. Fewer opportunities to encounter nature mean that the benefits of engaging with nature are often not realised by urban residents. In response to this, there is a growing number of initiatives that aim to connect people with nature, for the benefit of individuals, communities and nature conservation. However, in order to maximise these benefits, it is important to understand the potential transformative effects for participants, both on a personal level and in terms of wider impacts.
   Aims In this study, we evaluate the social outcomes of a participatory wildlife conservation project in an urban area in north-east England, using hedgehogs as the focal species.
   Methods Based on an approach of community volunteers working alongside scientific researchers in an evaluation of hedgehog urban habitat use, we examine the transformative effects of this involvement at the individual and community levels via qualitative semi-structured interviews with community volunteers.
   Key results Participants were motivated by personal wellbeing factors such as enjoying proximity to the study species, learning and social factors. Participation in the study itself indicates a degree of motivation for engaging with a study of this sort. Nevertheless, involvement in the study was a successful vehicle for increasing participants' engagement with nature both during the study and potentially into the future, particularly in terms of biological recording and gardening for wildlife.
   Conclusions Participation in a wildlife study is a positive experience for many volunteers, leading to actual and potential changes in both personal and wider social outcomes.
   Implications Participatory initiatives such as the one described have an important role to play in signposting and supporting volunteers to follow future environmental aspirations and maximise the personal and social benefits associated with participation. This could be enhanced by ensuring that volunteering opportunities are linked in with pre-existing community-based networks that can act as advocates for environmental and wildlife conservation.

AB  - Residential yards comprise a substantial portion of urban landscapes, and the collective effects of the management of many individual yards may scale up to affect urban biodiversity. We conducted bird surveys and social surveys in Chicago-area (Illinois, USA) residential neighborhoods to identify the relative importance of yard design and management activities for native birds. We found that groups of neighboring yards, in the aggregate, were more important for native bird species richness than environmental characteristics at the neighborhood or landscape scale. The ratio of evergreen to deciduous trees in yards and the percentage of yards with trees and plants with fruits or berries were positively associated with native bird species richness, whereas the number of outdoor cats had a negative association. The number of birdfeeders was not an important predictor for native species richness. We also found that migratory birds were observed on transects with more wildlife-friendly features in yards, and nonnative birds were observed on transects with greater numbers of outdoor cats and dogs. Our results highlight the potential importance of residential matrix management as a conservation strategy in urban areas.

AB  - Indigenous belief systems and informal institutions that result in the conservation of wild species or sites exemplify biocultural conservation. The erosion of cultural beliefs and practices can have adverse, often severe, consequences for biodiversity. We explored the relationships among informal institutions, religion, and human attitudes toward sacred populations of a threatened, endemic species, Sclater's monkey (Cercopithecus sclateri), in two communities in southeastern Nigeria. Due to habitat loss and hunting pressure across the species' range, monkeys in these two sites live alongside people, raid farms and gardens, and are commonly viewed as pests. Using structured (n = 410) and semi-structured (n = 21) interviews, we examined factors influencing residents' views of the monkeys, mechanisms affecting adherence to social taboos against harming monkeys, and implications for conservation. Our analyses revealed that most residents, particularly those from one community, women, and farmers, held negative opinions of the monkeys. Crop and garden raiding by monkeys had the most adverse effect on people's attitudes. Although the adoption of Christianity weakened residents' views regarding the no-killing taboos, continued adherence to the taboos was particularly influenced by supernatural retribution in one site and community disapproval in the other. Only one community widely conferred symbolic importance on the monkeys. Such site differences illustrate the value of local cultural understanding in conservation. Pre-intervention studies of this nature allow for the development of locally and culturally sensitive conservation programs, as well as better-informed assessments of what interventions are most likely to be effective.

AB  - Although urban areas are often considered to have uniformly negative effects on biodiversity, cities are most accurately characterized as heterogeneous mosaics of buildings, streets, parks, and gardens that include both good' and bad' areas for wildlife. However, to date, few studies have evaluated how human impacts vary in direction and magnitude across a heterogeneous urban landscape. In this study, we assessed the distribution of floral resources and flower-visiting insects across a variety of land uses in New York City. We visited both green spaces (e.g. parks, cemeteries) and heavily developed neighborhood blocks (e.g. with high or low density residential zoning) and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of median income, vegetation, and development intensity on floral resources and insects in both settings. Abundance and taxonomic richness of flower-visiting insects was significantly greater in green spaces than neighborhood blocks. The SEM results indicated that heavily-developed neighborhoods generally had fewer flower-visiting insects consistent with reductions in floral resources. However, some low-density residential neighborhoods maintained high levels of floral resources and flower-visiting insects. We found that the effects of surrounding vegetation on floral resources, and thus indirect effects on insects, varied considerably between green spaces and neighborhood blocks. Along neighborhood blocks, vegetation consisted of a mosaic of open gardens and sparsely distributed trees and had a positive indirect effect on flower-visiting insects. In contrast, vegetation in urban green spaces was associated with increased canopy cover and thus had a negative indirect effect on flower-visiting insects through reductions in floral resources. In both neighborhood blocks and green spaces, vegetation had a positive direct effect on flower-visiting insects independent of the influence of vegetation on floral resources. Our results demonstrate how inter-related components of an urban ecosystem can vary with respect to one another across a heterogeneous urban landscape, suggesting that it is inappropriate to generalize about urban systems as a whole without first addressing differences among component land use types.

AB  - Residential landscapes with private gardens are major land covers in cities and their sustainable management is paramount for achieving a resilient urban future. Here we focus on the value of residential ecosystems for biodiversity conservation and explore the social and ecological factors that influence wildlife-friendly garden management. Using a stratified sampling design across the UK city of Leeds, this interdisciplinary study develops and applies a mixed method approach, including questionnaires, interviews and ecological surveys across multiple spatial scales. We quantify wildlife-friendly gardening using two measures: (i) the number of wildlife-friendly features within gardens (the wildlife resources index, WRI); and (ii) the frequency of winter bird feeding. Wildlife-friendly gardening is influenced by a combination of garden characteristics and management intensity, householder demographics, wider environmental activity and landscape context. Residents reveal a range of motivations for wildlife-friendly gardening, notably personal well-being and a moral responsibility to nature. Respondents expressed a duty to maintain neighbourhood standards, revealing that social norms are a considerable barrier to uptake of wildlife-friendly activities, but also provide an opportunity where neighbour mimicry results in diffusion of wildlife-friendly practices. Community-driven initiatives that engage, educate and empower residents are better placed to encourage wildlife-friendly gardening than top-down financial incentives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although urban domestic gardens hold great significance for biodiversity support in cities, these habitats have been relatively insufficiently studied, especially in developing country contexts. This paper assesses the composition, diversity, density and distribution of plant vegetation in urban domestic gardens in the rapidly expanding south Indian city of Bangalore. Overall species diversity is high, with 1,668 trees from 91 species, as well as 192 species of herbs and shrubs encountered from a total sample of 328 urban single domestic gardens and shared apartment gardens distributed across the city. The majority of species were uncommon, found in less than 5 % of all sampled locations. A high proportion of about 30 % of all species had uses as food or as spices, medicinal properties, and/or religious significance. In general, large shared apartment gardens and single domestic gardens had a greater number of trees with larger size, and greater tree and herb/shrub diversity compared to small shared apartment gardens and small to moderate sized single domestic gardens. Shared apartment gardens tended to harbor relatively distinct sets of species, especially trees, palms and plants with largely ornamental significance, while single domestic gardens contained a greater proportion of flowering and medicinal plants used in daily worship, as well as fruit bearing and spice bearing plants and trees. Residents observed a wide range of other animal and insect species in their gardens, but also indicated a decrease in wildlife biodiversity over time. The majority of residents observed some cultural practices associated with feeding of urban wildlife and insects including the provision of rice and water for birds, and of sugar for ants. The results of this research provide a comprehensive description of plant diversity and distribution in single domestic gardens and shared apartment gardens of different sizes, which can be very important for citizen groups, planners and administrators working towards urban planting and greening in the south Indian city of Bangalore. They also supplement the extremely limited information currently available on urban domestic gardens outside of cities in the west.

AB  - Little is known of the motives of residents for planting and removing garden trees in Western cities and nothing is known of the motives related to planting and removing different types of trees. We test the hypotheses that attitudes towards trees are reflected in the planting and removal of trees in general and of different types of urban trees, and that attitude syndromes are related to socioeconomic, demographic and spatial characteristics. A questionnaire asked for information on motives for planting and removing trees in general, and on actual planting and removal of trees in the last five years. Responses to questions about motives, to other questions on the values and problems of trees, and to a photo-elicitation section were numerically classified to derive seven classes of residents: aesthetes; spiritual tree lovers; practical tree lovers; arboriphobes: native wildlife lovers; tree hazard minimisers; and indifferents. Membership of classes was influenced by income, tertiary education and gender, but not age, negative experiences of trees or ownership status, indicating that attitudes may be relatively durable and not easily amenable to change. Attitudes tended to be expressed in actions. Variation between attitude groups in the types of trees they prefer combined with turnover of property ownership may be responsible for a lack of old urban trees. Urban planners and land managers interested in influencing resident decisions about private trees need to address variation in attitudes between different segments of the population.

AB  - In 2005-2008, we radio-tracked 17 foxes in rural areas of Southern Germany. The mean home range size was 76.6 ha (95% MCP) or 138.9 ha (95% fixed kernel), and the built-up area formed an integral part of the home range. Home ranges of juvenile foxes were significantly smaller than home ranges of adult foxes. Gender-specific differences among adult foxes were not established. A minimum population density of 2.7 foxes per km(2) and summer densities of up to 13.4 foxes per km(2) were calculated. Therefore, the fox density was three to eight times higher than that of strictly rural foxes. Daytime resting sites of foxes were mostly found in forests (62.2%) and reedbed areas (20.6%). Of the resting sites, 14.8% were situated inside settlements, in fallow gardens or gardens of residents. During the day, foxes exhibited habitat preferences for forests and reedbed areas. A habitat structure that offers plenty of cover or dense vegetation is essential for its selection as a safe resting site. If this basic requirement is fulfilled, foxes also choose resting sites within settlements, and are not disturbed by human presence.

AB  - Residents near protected areas disproportionately bear conservation costs, in part due to crop raiding by protected animals when protected areas are situated within an agricultural landscape. These costs increase as conservation efforts lead to recovery of animal populations, and human population growth increases the proportion of land outside the parks used for agriculture. Financial and social costs associated with crop raiding were studied in 25 villages around Kibale National Park, Uganda. Perceptions about crop raiding were collected using focus groups and household surveys, while damage was evaluated based on physical monitoring of crop raiding incidents. The average financial loss for farmers around the park over six months was US$74 (1.5% of median household capital asset wealth) and damage was particularly high within 0.5 km of the park boundary. Households experiencing crop raiding were more prone to food insecurity, and higher rates of self-reported human and livestock diseases, while children from villages bordering the park tended to have poorer scholastic achievement. Compensation is not affordable for the wildlife authority, nor is it sustainable as crop raiding is escalating. To mitigate costs for local communities, funding has been justified for the implementation of crop raiding defenses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human alterations to the environment can exert strong evolutionary pressures, yet contemporary adaptation to human-mediated stressors is rarely documented in wildlife populations. A common-garden experimental design was coupled with comparative transcriptomics to discover evolved mechanisms enabling three populations of killifish resident in urban estuaries to survive normally lethal pollution exposure during development, and to test whether mechanisms are unique or common across populations. We show that killifish populations from these polluted sites have independently converged on a common adaptive mechanism, despite variation in contaminant profiles among sites. These populations are united by a similarly profound desensitization of aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-mediated transcriptional activation, which is associated with extreme tolerance to the lethal effects of toxic dioxin-like pollutants. The rapid, repeated, heritable and convergent nature of evolved tolerance suggests that ancestral killifish populations harboured genotypes that enabled adaptation to twentieth-century industrial pollutants.

AB  - Very little little is known about how lizards respond to urbanization. Given their small space requirements, opportunist lizard species can potentially exist in small patches of suitable urban habitat. This study identified the relative importance of landscape and habitat-level factors that influenced the occurrence of an opportunist and generally abundant species, the common skink Oligosoma nigriplantare polychrome in suburban private gardens in New Zealand. Private gardens are potentially important in sustaining urban wildlife as they make up a significant proportion of the total area of many cities. Common skinks were largely absent from the central suburbs and distributed in less highly ordered gardens around the city edge. Skink occurrence was influenced mainly by landscape-level features that reflect opportunities for dispersal into gardens from source populations (distance to city edge; presence of an adjacent grassy paddock) and habitat quality (messiness). To a lesser extent skink occurrence was associated with lower cat densities, less native vegetation and south-facing sites. Within private gardens common skinks were associated with areas with a high proportion of basking surfaces, lower plant species diversity, shorter distances to potential cover, and vegetation that was low in height and made up mainly of long exotic grasses. Despite common skinks' ability to thrive in exotic vegetation and their small spatial requirements, it is unlikely that they will thrive in urban areas unless gardening practices change to increase resource availability and provide refuges from predators.

AB  - Domestic gardens provide a significant component of urban green infrastructure but their relative contribution to eco-system service provision remains largely un-quantified. 'Green infrastructure' itself is often ill-defined, posing problems for planners to ascertain what types of green infrastructure provide greatest benefit and under what circumstances. Within this context the relative merits of gardens are unclear; however, at a time of greater urbanization where private gardens are increasingly seen as a 'luxury', it is important to define their role precisely. Hence, the nature of this review is to interpret existing information pertaining to gardens/gardening per se, identify where they may have a unique role to play and to highlight where further research is warranted. The review suggests that there are significant differences in both form and management of domestic gardens which radically influence the benefits. Nevertheless, gardens can play a strong role in improving the environmental impact of the domestic curtilage, e.g. by insulating houses against temperature extremes they can reduce domestic energy use. Gardens also improve localized air cooling, help mitigate flooding and provide a haven for wildlife. Less favourable aspects include contributions of gardens and gardening to greenhouse gas emissions, misuse of fertilizers and pesticides, and introduction of alien plant species. Due to the close proximity to the home and hence accessibility for many, possibly the greatest benefit of the domestic garden is on human health and well-being, but further work is required to define this clearly within the wider context of green infrastructure.

AB  - The loss of habitat due to suburban and urban development represents one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. Conservation developments have emerged as a key player for reconciling new ex-urban residential development with ecosystem services. However, as more than half of the world population lives in urban and suburban developments, identifying conservation partners to facilitate retrofitting existing residential neighborhoods becomes paramount. Homeowner associations (HOA) manage a significant proportion of residential developments in the United States, which includes the landscape design for yards and gardens. These areas have the potential to mitigate the loss of urban biodiversity when they provide habitat for native wildlife. Therefore, the conditions and restrictions imposed upon the homeowner by the HOA could have profound effects on the local wildlife habitat. We explored the potential of HOAs to promote conservation by synthesizing research from three monitoring programs from Phoenix, Arizona. We compared native bird diversity, arthropod diversity, and plant diversity between neighborhoods with and without a HOA. Neighborhoods belonging to HOAs had significantly greater bird and plant diversity, although insect diversity did not differ. The institutional framework structuring HOAs, including sanctions for enforcement coupled with a predictable maintenance regime that introduces regular disturbance, might explain why neighborhoods with a HOA had greater bird diversity. For neighborhoods with a HOA, we analyzed landscape form and management practices. We linked these features with ecological function and suggested how to modify management practices by adopting strategies from the Sustainable Sites Initiative, an international sustainable landscaping program, to help support biodiversity in current and future residential landscapes.

AB  - Urbanization is recognized as one of the greatest threats to biodiversity throughout the world. However, the vegetation within an urbanized landscape is diverse and includes a variety of native and exotic plant species. This variation allows for testing whether certain landscape designs outperform others in the support of native biodiversity. Residential yards represent a large component of an urban landscape and, if managed collectively for birds and other wildlife, could offset some of the negative effects of urbanization. In addition, many urbanites have their primary interaction with the natural world in their front and back yards. Therefore, ensuring positive wildlife experiences for them is essential in promoting urban biodiversity. At the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research site we tested the efficacy of native landscaping in residential yards in attracting native birds. We also explored the links between socioeconomic factors, landscape designs, and urban gradient measurements with the urban bird communities. A redundancy analysis suggested that native desert bird species increased in abundance in neighborhoods with desert landscaping designs, neighborhoods closer to large desert tracts, and higher-income neighborhoods. Variance partitioning showed that collectively these three sets of environmental variables explained almost 50% of the variation in the urban bird community. Results suggested racial and economic inequities in access to biodiversity, whereby predominantly Hispanic and lower-income neighborhoods had fewer native birds. We also found that residents' satisfaction with bird diversity was positively correlated with actual bird diversity. Our study provides new insights into the relative importance of socioeconomic variables and common urban ecological measurements in explaining urban bird communities. Urban planners can use this information to develop residential landscapes that support the well-being of both birds and people.

AB  - Introduction. Protected areas represent a huge reservoir of biological resources which local residents are highly dependent on. The non-inclusion of local knowledge is often an obstacle to conservation policy and sustainable use of biodiversity in these areas. The Reserve of Pama, located in the South-sudanian zone of Burkina Faso, is a good example of the discrepancy between the subsistence needs of local populations and the need to conserve biodiversity. Assessing the socio-economic importance of this reserve for local residents could lead to adapting a better strategy of natural resource management. Materials and methods. Ethnobotanical surveys were conducted based on interviews. The information obtained from the interrogation of 30 resource people identified the different uses made of the reserve by local people and the impact of these uses on the flora, and assessed the perception of villagers on the way of managing their forest resources. Results. A total of 58 plant species in the reserve, over 15% of the local flora, provide various resources to local populations, including construction equipment (90% response), medicinal plants (73.33%), food plants (73.33%), etc. The plant species most in demand were found to be, among others, Vitellaria paradoxa (80%). Parkia biglobosa (66.67%), Diospyros mespiliformis (33.33%), Gardenia erubescens (33.33%), Lannea microcarpa (33.33%). Tamarindus indica (33.33%), Anchypogon gayanus (26.67%) and A. cbinensis (26.67%). Some of these species have proved increasingly rare due to the deterioration of climatic conditions, abuse of green wood and soil depletion. Conclusion. The study we conducted on the reserve of Pama leads us to advocate stronger measures to protect the environment through the involvement of local residents. Moreover, the field planting of useful species in the process of depletion would be able to limit the operating pressure on the reserve.

AB  - Supplementary feeding of wild birds during winter is one of the most popular wildlife management activities, and is likely to have profound influence on the behavioural ecology of a species. At garden bird feeders, birds are now often fed well into the breeding season. Providing food within an established songbird territory, however, is likely to influence the territorial behaviour of the resident male. We used song performance during the dawn chorus in early spring to study behavioural changes in food-supplemented great tits, Parus major. After 2 weeks of continuous food supply within their territory, supplemented males started dawn singing later than control males, and thus postponed their regular dawn chorus before sunrise. This effect was maintained 2 weeks after food supplementation had ended. However, we did not find an effect of long-term feeding on song output. Our results were largely unexpected because formal models and field studies on short-term food supplementation suggested an earlier start of dawn singing or a higher dawn song output. Because we did not observe great tits visiting the feeders before sunrise or food supplementation increasing the numbers of conspecific intruders, the reasons for the delay in the start of dawn singing remain unclear; possible explanations include the presence of predators at feeding stations and the quality of the supplementary food itself. Delaying dawn singing could potentially affect the reproductive success of supplemented males, for example if females base extrapair mating decisions on dawn song performance of their mates.

AB  - The importance of urban biodiversity is debated by many in the conservation community. Some researchers and managers focus on threats to biodiversity associated with urbanization and land use change. In contrast to this approach, people who live in, study, or care about cities-ecologists, wildlife managers, conservation biologists, planners, and local residents-have debated what biodiversity means in urban settings. Recent literature on biodiversity in cities notes the range of ecological, social, and cultural meanings of urban biodiversity and stresses the importance of defining the setting and scales at which biodiversity is being assessed. This approach to urban biodiversity has documented the importance of conservation of rare species and habitats but also the importance of managing the range of habitats in and around where people live, work, and play.

AB  - Human dimensions research can help resource and wildlife managers make informed decisions, target information efforts, and gain a greater understanding of the factors that comprise attitudes toward wildlife management efforts. Despite these often-stated merits, studies addressing the human dimensions of resource and wildlife management efforts are rare in Europe. A proposed restoration of free-ranging European bison (Bison bonasus) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, has presented an opportunity to help address this research gap. During May to July 2006, we used a randomly distributed, self-administered questionnaire (n = 398) to assess local residents' attitudes, beliefs, and levels of support or opposition toward the proposed restoration. These factors were compared across two administrative regions spanned by the proposed restoration area. We found that respondents from the Siegen-Wittgenstein region held significantly more positive attitudes and significantly higher knowledge levels than respondents from the Hochsauerlandkreis region. Principal components analysis revealed that attitudes comprised a general attitude factor pertaining to issues such as the importance of conserving bison for future generations and a lifestyle impact factor, which included items pertaining to bison-caused damages to trees and crops. Logistic regression was used to show the influence of fear of bison on attitudes. We discuss the likely causes and management implications of our findings and provide suggestions to managers wishing to target information efforts and address the concerns of those affected by the proposed restoration.

AB  - The human population is increasingly disconnected from nature due to urbanisation. To counteract this phenomenon, the UK government has been actively promoting wildlife gardening. However, the extent to which such activities are conducted and the level of resource provision for biodiversity (e.g., food and nesting sites) within domestic gardens remains poorly documented. Here we generate estimates for a selection of key resources provided within gardens at a national scale, using 12 survey datasets gathered across the UK. We estimate that 22.7 million households (87% of homes) have access to a garden. Average garden SiZe is 190 m(2), extrapolating to a total area of 432,924 ha. Although substantial, this coverage is still an order of magnitude less than that of statutory protected areas. Approximately 12.6 million (48%) households provide supplementary food for birds, 7.4 million of which specifically use bird feeders. Similarly, there are a minimum of 4.7 million nest boxes within gardens. These figures equate to one bird feeder for every nine potentially feeder-using birds in the UK, and at least one nest box for every six breeding pairs of cavity nesting birds. Gardens also contain 2.5-3.5 million ponds and 28.7 million trees, which is just under a quarter of all trees occurring outside woodlands. Ongoing urbanisation, characterised by increased housing densities, is inevitable throughout the UK and elsewhere. The important contribution domestic gardens make to the green space infrastructure in residential areas must be acknowledged, as their reduction will impact biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, and the well-being of the human population.

AB  - Urban forests are increasingly valued for multiple benefits such as amenity, cultural values, native biodiversity, ecosystem services, and carbon sequestration. Urban biodiversity in particular, is the new focus although global homogenisation is undermining regional differentiation. In the northern hemisphere (e.g., Canada and USA) and in the southern hemisphere, particularly in countries like South Africa, Australia, South America and New Zealand, local biodiversity is further impacted by historical colonisation from Europe. After several centuries, urban forests are now composed of synthetic and spontaneous mixtures of native species, and exotic species from around the temperate world (e.g., Europe, North and South America, South Africa, Asia). As far as we are aware no-one has carried out in-depth study of these synthetic forests in any Southern Hemisphere city. Here we describe the composition, structure, and biodiversity conservation imperatives of urban temperate forests at 90 random locations in Christchurch city, New Zealand.
   We document considerable plant diversity; the total number of species encountered in the 253 sampled urban forest patches was 486. Despite this incredibly variable data set, our ability to explain variation in species richness was surprisingly good and clearly indicates that total species richness was higher in larger patches with greater litter and vegetation cover, and taller canopy height. Species richness was also higher in patches surrounded by higher population densities and closer to very large native forest patches. Native species richness was higher in patches with higher soil pH, lower canopy height, and greater litter cover and in patches closer to very large native forest patches indicating dispersal out of native areas and into gardens. Eight distinct forest communities were identified by Two-Way INdicator SPecies ANalysis (TWINSPAN) using the occurrence of 241 species that occurred in more than two out of all 253 forest patches.
   Christchurch urban forest canopies were dominated by exotic tree species in parklands and in street tree plantings (linear parkland). Native tree and shrub species were not as common in public spaces but their overall density high in residential gardens. There was some explanatory power in our data, since less deprivation resulted in greater diversity and density, and more native species, which in turn is associated with private ownership. We hypothesise that a number of other factors, which were not well reflected in our measured environmental variables, are responsible for much of the remaining variation in the plant community structure, e.g., advertising, peoples choice. For a more sustainable asset base of native trees in New Zealand cities we need more, longer-lived native species, in large public spaces, including a greater proportion of species that bear fruit and nectar suitable for native wildlife. We may then achieve cities with ecological integrity that present multiple historical dimensions, and sequester carbon in legible landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - As suburban landscapes expand, it is critical to understand their capacity to support wildlife. Pollinators, specifically bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila), are to some degree compatible with urbanization and may be able to exist in suburbs in diverse assemblages. We surveyed 21 residential gardens for bees in Westchester County, a suburban area immediately north of New York City. From a sample of 1,675 individuals, we documented 110 species, of which 95% were native, 50% were solitary, and 93% were polylectic. In terms of abundance of specimens, eusocial (50% of specimens), native (97%), and polylectic (98%) bees were dominant. Contrary to our expectation, based on previous bee surveys in urban landscapes, the bee community documented was not depauperate in either soil-nesting or parasitic species (65 and 19% of species, respectively), nor was it enriched in exotic species (6% of species). Instead, the assemblage resembled the richer bee fauna documented at a 1,520-ha research preserve (forest) located in the same region, although certain specialist (oligolectic) and/or forest-associated species were absent. These results suggest that suburban landscapes in eastern North America have the potential to host relatively diverse and intact bee communities.

AB  - Throughout Central Europe, foxes have taken over urban areas as their habitat. In Southern Germany, these foxes are also carriers of the small fox tapeworm, which causes a serious zoonotic infection in humans. Therefore, a survey was carried out in a suburb of the city of Munich. A postal questionnaire was used to analyse the attitudes, opinions and fears of these participants towards their urban foxes and the background to these attitudes. Questionnaires were sent to all households with gardens and collected in again via the community council. Seven hundred and seventy-nine or 31% of questionnaires were returned. Only a few people are afraid of the fox itself; however, 55% are afraid of the fox tapeworm. Worming the animals is the preferred counter-measure, with 81% in favour. The majority of inhabitants are pleased to see a fox in the community and feel the animals have a right to live. People are afraid of the tapeworm either because they have children in the household or because of increased knowledge of the subject or because it has increasingly become an issue. On the basis of the results of this study, it is to be expected that radical solutions such as killing the foxes are unlikely to be accepted among the population. Worming of the foxes does, however, meet with general approval.

AB  - Endocrine disrupting (ED) chemicals are compounds that alter the normal functioning of the endocrine system, potentially causing disease or deformity in organisms and their offspring. Pesticides are used widely to kill unwanted organisms in crops, public areas, homes and gardens and medicinally to kill parasites. Many are proven or suspected to be EDs. Ancient physiological similarities between different vertebrate groups suggest that disorders observed in wildlife may indicate risks to humans. This makes accurate risk assessment and effective legislation difficult. In this paper, the hazardous properties of pesticides which are known to have ED properties are reviewed in order to assess the implications for risk assessment. As well as data on sources of exposure in the United Kingdom (UK) an assessment of the evidence on the health effects of ED pesticides is also included. In total, 127 have been identified from the literature and their effects and modes of action are listed in this paper. Using the UK as a case study, the types and quantities of pesticides used, and their methods of application are assessed, along with their potential pathways to humans. In the UK reliable data are available only for agricultural use, so non-agricultural routes of pesticide exposure have been poorly quantified. The exposure of people resident in or visiting rural areas could also have been grossly under-estimated. Material links between ED pesticide use and specific illnesses or deformities are complicated by the multifactorial nature of disease, which can be affected by factors such as diet. Despite these difficulties, a large body of evidence has accumulated linking specific conditions to ED pesticides in wildlife and humans. A more precautionary approach to the use of ED pesticides, especially for non-essential purposes is proposed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All fights reserved.

AB  - The 558 prey items brought home by one domestic cat, recorded over its 17-year lifetime, included 221 mice, 63 rats, 35 rabbits, 4 hares and 2 weasels. The cat hunted up to 600 m from the house, and prey was caught both inside and outside the 0.5 ha garden. Of the 223 birds brought in, 54 were native, including 43 silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis), but those killed were quickly replaced, so there was always a resident population of 1-2 pairs. The other known native birds comprised five fantails (Rhipidura fuliginosa), four warblers (Gerygone igata), a kingfisher (Halcyon sancta), and a shining cuckoo (Chrysococcyx lucidus). Only nine skinks (Cyclodina aenea) and one frog (Litoria raniformis) were brought in. The abundance of birds and reptiles in the garden showed no apparent change over the 17 years compared with the previous 15-year-period without a cat. By contrast, the cat exterminated the rabbit population in the garden, and "farmed" surrounding burrows during its whole life; all other prey killed declined in frequency after the cat was 8-9 years old.

AB  - 1Urban areas are predicted to grow significantly in the foreseeable future because of increasing human population growth. Predicting the impact of urban development and expansion on mammal populations is of considerable interest due to possible effects on biodiversity and human-wildlife conflict.
   2The British government has recently announced a substantial housing programme to meet the demands of its growing population and changing socio-economic profile. This is likely to result in the construction of high-density, low-cost housing with small residential gardens. To assess the potential effects of this programme, we analysed the factors affecting the current pattern of use of residential gardens by a range of mammal species using a questionnaire distributed in wildlife and gardening magazines and via The Mammal Society.
   3Twenty-two species/species groups were recorded. However, the pattern of garden use by individual species was limited, with only six species/species groups (bats, red fox Vulpes vulpes, grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis, hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus, mice, voles) recorded as frequent visitors to > 20% of gardens in the survey.
   4There was a high degree of association between the variables recorded in the study, such that it was difficult to quantify the effects of individual variables. However, all species/species groups appeared to be negatively affected by the increased fragmentation and reduced proximity of natural and semi-natural habitats, decreasing garden size and garden structure, but to differing degrees. Patterns of garden use were most clearly affected by house location (city, town, village, rural), with garden use declining with increasing urbanization for the majority of species/species groups, except red foxes and grey squirrels. Increasing urbanization is likely to be related to a wide range of interrelated factors, any or all of which may affect a range of mammal species.
   5Overall, the probable effects of the planned housing development programme in Britain are not likely to be beneficial to mammal populations, although the pattern of use examined in this study may represent patterns of habitat selection by species rather than differences in distribution or abundance. Consequently, additional data are required on the factors affecting the density of species within urban environments.

AB  - In situ propagation of butterflies was attempted through establishment of a butterfly garden in a 0.5 ha degraded moist deciduous forest patch at the Kerala Forest Research Institute campus at Peechi, Kerala, India. Creation of butterfly habitats through landscaping and introduction of suitable host plants to sustain different species of butterflies were the major activities undertaken. There was tremendous increase in the butterfly population with 4509 sightings of butterflies belonging to 43 species after 15 months and 10,502 sightings of butterflies belonging to 56 species after 30 months. These included eight species that are endemic to the Western Ghats and ten species having protected status under the Indian Wildlife Act. Investigations on the relationship between the occurrence of different butterflies and the weather conditions revealed that an average temperature ranging between 25 and 26 degrees C was most favourable for many butterflies followed by 23 and 25 degrees C as well as 27 and 29 degrees C. Similarly, atmospheric humidity ranging between 80 and 100% was the most preferred range followed by 60 and 80%. With regard to daily rainfall, 50 mm was the most favourable followed by 50-100 mm rainfall. Heavy rainfall was found to be unfavourable since few butterflies were observed above 100 mm of daily rainfall. By regulating humidity and temperature, it was possible to manipulate local populations of butterflies, particularly danaid butterflies. More or less continuous population was noticed for some Danaidae, Lycaenidae, Papilionidae and Pieridae, which also developed resident populations in the study area. Strategies were also standardized for setting up butterfly gardens.

AB  - Aims: To examine the relationships among increasing estuarine shellfish closings due to bacterial contamination, adjacent shoreline land uses and environmental variables.
   Methods and Results: A 1 year study of faecal coliform bacterial contamination of a small estuary in central NC, USA was done relative to adjacent land uses. The area has experienced rapid growth in residential shoreline development including the installation of adjacent, separate docking facilities for larger boats, each < 11 slips (pseudomarina) that appear to be a single marina (individual facilities of > 10 slips). Six near-shore sites were selected [old developed shore (OD), undeveloped shore (UD), two pseudomarinas (P1, P2), newly developed shore (ND) and a real marina (RM)]. Five locations were spaced along the shore near each site. Paired Thursday/Monday samples were collected biweekly (summer) and monthly (other seasons). Results indicate that OD had the highest bacteria counts followed by ND, RM and P1 & P2. Three sites (OD, ND and RM) failed to meet NC shellfishing waters standards at all locations. At the pseudomarina sites 4 of 10 locations failed to meet shellfish standards while two locations at UD failed to meet these standards. There were no significant differences between paired Thursday/Monday samples. At three sites (OD, UD and P2) bacteria counts were positively correlated with increased water level due to wind tides.
   Conclusions: Any type of estuarine shoreline development may result in closing of adjacent shellfishing waters. ND had bacterial counts second only to OD in spite of the retention of vegetated shoreline buffers and very new septic systems. As expected, the RM also failed to meet shellfish standards. Unexpectedly, only four of the 10 pseudomarina locations failed to meet the standards. Weekend boat use had no effect on bacterial counts. Surface runoff from rain and shoreline flooding from increased water levels increased bacterial counts, probably as a result of suspension of surface deposited faeces from wildlife and domestic animals.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Multiple docking facilities do not necessarily result in violations of shellfish water quality standards. However, the elevated bacterial counts observed along the newly developed shore suggest caution in approving the practice of allowing individual 'oyster gardening' off private piers if the oysters are intended for human consumption. The practice of automatic closure of shellfish waters around RMs was supported. Correlations of bacterial counts with time following significant rainfall suggests a sampling strategy to separate local sources of bacteria from more remote sources thus focusing limited remedial resources more effectively.

AB  - Within the expanding city of Brisbane in south-east Queensland, numerous fragments of native and regrowth vegetation are scattered across the largely urbanised landscape. These fragments provide refuge to a great diversity of native wildlife, and, provide residents with the opportunity to experience nature on their doorstep. To assess the diversity and abundance of this wildlife, recent changes in these parameters, and the value of wildlife and bushland fragments to residents of Brisbane, a questionnaire survey was distributed to 300 households each located adjacent to one of 38 urban bushland fragments. A total of 172 surveys (57%) were returned, producing 768 records of 83 fauna species, dominated by birds and mammals; bandicoots were widely reported from the 38 fragments. Several historical records provided evidence of recent local extinctions within fragments, highlighting the continuing declines in various species of native wildlife within Brisbane. Several human-wildlife conflicts were identified, but overall residents were tolerant of such conflicts. Bandicoots were disliked by a small minority (3%) of residents owing to the holes they dig in lawns and gardens in search of food. and their potential as vectors of ticks. Most respondents expressed ail appreciation for the presence of native wildlife (96%) and bushland fragments (97%) in their local area, emphasising the importance of incorporating human dimension values into the management of this urban biodiversity.

AB  - The extent and continued expansion of urbanisation has focused attention on the significance for native biodiversity of those green spaces remaining within such areas and the most appropriate methods of managing them. In the UK, a high proportion of urban space is comprised of the private or domestic gardens associated with residential dwellings, and many recommendations have been made for simple changes to improve their value for biodiversity ('wildlife gardening'). Here, we report the results of replicated experimental tests of five such common recommendations, involving the introduction to gardens of (i) artificial nest sites for solitary bees and wasps; (ii) artificial nest sites for bumblebees; (iii) small ponds; (iv) dead wood for fungi and other saproxylic organisms; and ( v) patches of nettles Urtica dioica L. for butterfly larvae. The broad conclusion is that whilst some methods for increasing the biodiversity of garden environments may be very effective, others have a low probability of success on the timescales and spatial scales likely to be acceptable to many garden owners. If one of the functions of small scale biodiversity enhancement is to develop and encourage awareness of biodiversity and its conservation, then encouragement to conduct particular activities must be balanced with a realistic appraisal of their likely success.

AB  - The contribution to urban green space by private or domestic gardens in residential zones was investigated in the city of Sheffield, UK, as part of a wider study of the garden resource and its associated biodiversity. The attributes of 61 gardens, including patterns of landcover and vegetation cover, were explored in relation to housing characteristics and the nature of the surrounding landscape. The number of surrounding houses, and the areas of buildings and of roads were negatively correlated with garden area. The proportion of a housing parcel comprising garden increased with parcel size, although the proportion that was rear garden remained relatively constant. Garden size played an overwhelming role in determining garden composition: larger gardens supported more landcovers, contained greater extents of three-quarters of the recorded landcovers, and were more likely to contain trees taller than 2 m, vegetable patches, and composting sites. Unvegetated landcovers made greater proportional contributions as garden size declined. All categories of vegetation canopy increased with garden size, and large gardens supported disproportionately greater cover above 3 m. House age was a less significant factor determining garden landcover. Gardens of newer houses were more likely to occur towards the edge of the urban area, and older properties, that contained fewer hedges, possessed less canopy between 2-3 m. The extent and occurrence of different landcovers in gardens, and their consequences for wildlife, are considered for residential patches in urban areas. The implications for urban planners are discussed.

TI  - Diversity and management of wild mammals in tea gardens in the rainforest regions of the Western Ghats, India: A case study from a tea estate in the Anaimalai Hills
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE

KW  - CONSERVATION
AB  - In many places in the Western Ghats hill ranges of southern India, rainforest has been clear-felled in order to grow tea plantations. Such plantations now exist as islands of agriculture surrounded by forest tracts, most of which are protected as wildlife sanctuaries. We report a case study from one such tea garden. We observed a diversity of wild mammals, both herbivores and carnivores, using open grass patches, swamps and vegetation along streams in the tea garden. Large mammals were observed to forage in such areas and return to the adjoining forests. Small mammals were either resident or used stream vegetation as a corridor to move from one side of the forest to the opposite side. Dhole (Cuon alpinus) often preyed on sambar (Cervus unicolor) and even denned twice in the estate. We also observed a minimal human-animal conflict in the area. Problems such as stealing of meat from sambar kills made by dhole, could be overcome by awareness. We propose that such areas can be effectively managed such that it could facilitate movement of wild mammals with least damage to the commercial activity related to tea. Such a wildlife management strategy can become a model that could be followed in tea-growing areas throughout the Western Ghats.

TI  - Evaluating the conservation mission of zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens, and natural history museums
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - ATTITUDES
AB  - Collection-based institutions-zoos, aquariums, museums, and botanical gardens-exhibit wildlife and thus have a special connection with nature. Many of these institutions emphasize a mission of conservation, and, undeniably, they do contribute directly to conservation education and conservation science. They present an exceptional opportunity for many urban residents to see the wonders of life, and they can contribute to education and habitat preservation. Because many collection-based institutions now hold a stated mission of conservation, we suggest eight potential questions to evaluate actions toward that mission: (1) Does conservation thought define policy decisions? (2) Is there sufficient organizational funding for conservation activities? (3) Is there a functional conservation department? (4) Does the institution advocate for conservation? (5) Do conservation education programs effectively target children and adults? (6) Does the institution contribute directly to habitat protection locally and internationally? (7) Do exhibits explain and promote conservation efforts? and (8) Do internal policies and activities protect the environment? These questions are offered as a place to begin discussion. We hope they will help employees and administrators of a collection-based institution (and citizens of the surrounding community) think about and support their institution's conservation activities. Public support and praise for institutions that are striving toward solutions for conservation problems and pressure on organizations that are moving more slowly toward a conservation orientation can help shift more resources toward saving nature.

AB  - Stimulated by animal-welfare concerns, community programs to "rescue" urban wildlife generate many interactions between humans and wildlife. Such rescue activities (1) may have direct ecological effects (by modifying mortality patterns of wildlife, or geographic distributions at the local level), and (2) may provide valuable information on local abundance and distribution of taxa, the nature of threats to urban wildlife, and biological attributes of poorly-known species. We examine these issues for reptiles rescued by community-based animal-welfare groups in south-eastern Australia. Records gathered by the Wildlife Information and Rescue Service over a 10-year period (1989-1998) in New South Wales quantify rates, determinants and outcomes of reptile rescues. Despite their scarcity in urban habitats, snakes (11,067 records) were represented almost as often as lizards (11,108). Typically, rescued lizards were large in size or snake-like in appearance. Most reptiles (especially snakes) were rescued not because of injury, but because the local residents wanted them removed. Thus, very large numbers of these animals were translocated to release sites. Of the injured animals, small-bodied reptile species (and juveniles of larger species) were frequent victims of attacks by domestic cats and dogs. Larger reptiles were more often injured by motor vehicles. Capture rates for all species were highest in warmer months, and especially on days with dry, warm weather. These temporal patterns seem to be due to reptile biology not human behaviour. The rapid increase in animal-rescue activities indicates that potential ecological effects (especially, arising from translocation of "problem" wildlife) deserve further study. At the same time, such community groups can provide valuable information for ecologists. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neuroblastoma is the most common neoplasm in children under 1 year of age. We examined the relation between residential exposure to pesticides and neuroblastoma, using data from a case-control study of risk factors for neuroblastoma. Incident cases of neuroblastoma (N = 538) were identified through the Pediatric Oncology Group and the Children's Cancer Group. One age-matched control was identified for each case by random digit dialing. Telephone interviews with each parent collected information on residential exposure to pesticides, Pesticide use in both the home and garden were modestly associated with neuroblastoma [odds ratio (OR) = 1.6 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.0-2.3, and OR = 1.7 (95% CI = 0.9-2.1), respectively]. Compared with infants [OR = 1.0 (95% CI = 0.6-2.0)], stronger associations were found for garden pesticides in children diagnosed after 1 year of age [OR = 2.2 (95% CI = 1.3-3.6)], which suggests that pesticides may act through a mechanism more common for neuroblastomas in older children. There was no evidence of differential pesticide effects in subgroups of neuroblastoma defined by MYCN oncogene amplification or tumor stage.

AB  - A preliminary analysis of the use by bats of National Trust properties revealed that all 14 resident species have been recorded. Comparison with a national database of records for Britain managed by English Nature (NCC Bat database) showed that the scarcer species are better represented roosting in buildings on Trust properties than in other buildings. In addition, survey of Trust properties has shown that a high proportion of buildings are used by bats. Bats provide unusual wildlife links between buildings, gardens and countryside through which the Trust can promote nature conservation, and resolve conflicts between building or landscape restoration and the bat habitat requirements. The role of the County Bat Groups in survey and promotion of bats on Trust properties is becoming increasingly important, especially if we are able to identify key properties for bats.

AB  - Building and preserving a network of greenways can be an intricate activity requiring interdisciplinary collaboration. Greenway segments often require local input and participation. In addition, greenways are not necessarily generic open spaces, but can be managed structurally to fulfill specific spatial and temporal requirements. This paper describes local activities in the Fargo (North Dakota)-Moorhead (Minnesota) metropolitan area related to preserving and embellishing the greenway focused around the Red River Valley of the North. This greenway is part of a larger Western Hemisphere greenway, composed of riparian corridors operating as wildlife habitat migration flyways and as resident wildlife habitat. Local activities include demonstration gardens, comprehensive corridor planning, habitat analysis, and revegetation studies. From 1985 to 1990, four spatial treatment investigations were completed, one spatial planning study was prepared, and five demonstration gardens were built. The spatial treatment investigations revealed that the wildlife occupying the greenway could be divided into four habitat-use dimensions, suggesting four important habitat associations for the greenway. The study also revealed three distinct vegetation zones for re-establishing herbaceous vegetation in non-wooded planting conditions. In addition, one experiment indicated that replanting the disturbed woodland corridor was not influenced by seedling size and that Fraxinus pennsylvanica seedlings were highly successful at surviving in a gap opening within the forest corridor, In the last experiment, a seeding application rate study indicated that seeding rates three times higher than recommended rates resulted in improved vegetation cover of non-wooded herbaceous vegetation planting sites. The spatial planning study illustrated landscape patterns for the greenway composed of a continuous tree canopy corridor, augmented by herbaceous vegetation patches, food plots, and snags. To build and manage the greenway, this investigation reaffirms the importance of multi-disciplinary collaboration, local participation, and the potential individualistic structure of a greenway. The study suggests that both broad landscape planning visions and detailed site endeavors are necessary to understand and manage the greenway successfully.
