Title = {Why garden for wildlife? Social and ecological drivers, motivations and
   barriers for biodiversity management in residential landscapes},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},

Abstract = {Residential landscapes with private gardens are major land covers in
   cities and their sustainable management is paramount for achieving a
   resilient urban future. Here we focus on the value of residential
   ecosystems for biodiversity conservation and explore the social and
   ecological factors that influence wildlife-friendly garden management.
   Using a stratified sampling design across the UK city of Leeds, this
   interdisciplinary study develops and applies a mixed method approach,
   including questionnaires, interviews and ecological surveys across
   multiple spatial scales. We quantify wildlife-friendly gardening using
   two measures: (i) the number of wildlife-friendly features within
   gardens (the wildlife resources index, WRI); and (ii) the frequency of
   winter bird feeding. Wildlife-friendly gardening is influenced by a
   combination of garden characteristics and management intensity,
   householder demographics, wider environmental activity and landscape
   context. Residents reveal a range of motivations for wildlife-friendly
   gardening, notably personal well-being and a moral responsibility to
   nature. Respondents expressed a duty to maintain neighbourhood
   standards, revealing that social norms are a considerable barrier to
   uptake of wildlife-friendly activities, but also provide an opportunity
   where neighbour mimicry results in diffusion of wildlife-friendly
   practices. Community-driven initiatives that engage, educate and empower
   residents are better placed to encourage wildlife-friendly gardening
   than top-down financial incentives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {1. Private domestic gardens have immense potential to contribute to
   urban biodi-versity conservation. However, they are divided into small
   private plots and man-aged individually by garden owners. Therefore,
   engagement in wildlife-friendly gardening (WFG), which entails
   alternative management and design choices, re-lies on the individual
   willingness of each garden owner.2. Using an online survey and
   qualitative walking interviews with garden owners, our study explores
   individual internal and external factors underlying engage-ment in WFG.
   We interpret and reflect on our findings in the context of gardening as
   a relational practice between people and nature.3. Our findings suggest
   that motivations for gardening play a central role in how internal and
   external factors promote or impede WFG. For example, motivations towards
   organic gardening and learning from nature promote WFG, whereas
   per-sonal and family care and well- being motivations seem to impede
   it.4. The perceived and actual garden area, as well as self-reported
   insufficient knowl-edge and social norms, covary the most with
   engagement in WFG. Engagement in WFG relates to people's relationships
   with nature, as embodied in social norms of community acceptance and
   cohesion, and care and respect for nature and others.5. Future research
   into pro-environmental behaviours in gardens should adopt more
   relational approaches that go beyond the individual self and take better
   account of feedback between individual actions and social relations.},

Abstract = {Private gardens comprise a large component of greenspace in cities and
   can offer substantial conservation opportunities. There has been strong
   advocacy from researchers, policymakers, and conservation practitioners
   to engage householders in wildlife-friendly gardening practices to
   increase the quantity, quality and connection of habitat resources for
   urban wildlife. Despite this call to action, there remains limited
   knowledge on the use and benefit of some wildlife-friendly structures
   within gardens, such as artificial refuges and water sources. In
   collaboration with 131 citizen scientists in southwestern Australia, we
   examined the use of seven wildlife-friendly structure types by four
   vertebrate taxa groups. Following 2841 wildlife surveys undertaken
   between 31 July 2022 and 22 February 2023, we found that all structures
   were used primarily by target taxa, water sources were often used by
   relatively common species, certain structures such as possum shelters
   were used by rare and threatened species (e.g. western ringtail possum),
   and that there was evidence of animals making use of the
   wildlife-friendly structures for reproduction (e.g. bird eggs in nest
   boxes and tadpoles in water sources). Water sources were used more
   frequently and by a greater diversity of wildlife than artificial
   refuges. In particular, bird baths were used by the highest number of
   species (mainly birds) while ponds were used by the greatest variety of
   taxa (birds, reptiles, frogs, mammals). Our findings provide
   evidence-based support for the advocacy of wildlife-friendly gardening
   practices and further highlight the role of residential gardens for
   biodiversity conservation.},

Title = {Formative audience research to increase consumer demand for professional
   wildlife-friendly landscape maintenance},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {90},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Greenspace in residential landscapes meets human needs, connects people
   with nature, and supports wildlife and biodiversity. However, some
   landscape maintenance practices are detrimental to wildlife and
   components of their habitat. We conducted a cross-sectional study to
   understand consumer knowledge, the extent of existing demand, and
   barriers related to wildlife-friendly landscape maintenance practices.
   An electronic survey was employed to collect data among Florida
   residents who were at least 18 years old and had a lawn or landscape for
   which they made decisions regarding maintenance. Non-probability opt-in
   sampling was used to recruit participants. Altogether 2101 residents
   completed the survey, among which 1053 indicated they hired green
   industry professionals for some aspects of landscape maintenance.
   Residents were least knowledgeable (M +/- S.D. = 2.82 +/- 1.17) about
   when to apply products like pesticides to yard/planting areas to
   minimize harm to wildlife whereas they were most knowledgeable (M +/-
   S.D. = 3.32 +/- 1.16) about how to read pesticide labels when measured
   on a five-point Likert-type scale. The frequency of demand for 56
   wildlife-friendly landscape maintenance practices varied from most of
   the time to half of the time on a five-point Likert-type scale.
   Consumers agreed homeowner association restrictions, lack of knowledge,
   lack of awareness, lack of labeling on plants, and associated costs were
   some major barriers to their engagement in wildlife-friendly
   landscaping. It is recommended to work on reducing these perceived
   barriers among residents and increasing rewards with interventions like
   education, pledges, and financial incentives among others to increase
   demand for landscape maintenance services that support wildlife.},

   species richness in urban and arable landscapes},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {929},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Insect declines are being reported worldwide and private, residential
   gardens could provide refugia for these species under increasing land
   use change. Interest in wildlife-friendly gardening has increased, but
   many management recommendations lack a scientific evidence-base. We used
   a large citizen science scheme, the Garden Butterfly Survey (GBS), with
   data from over 600 gardens across Great Britain (2016 - 2021) to
   determine how the surrounding landscape influences the abundance and
   species richness of butterflies in gardens and whether wildlife-friendly
   gardening practices, such as having long grass and providing nectar
   plants, benefit butterflies. First, we show that GBS provides reliable
   estimates of species abundances by comparing with results from
   standardised, long-term monitoring data. Garden size and surrounding
   land use had significant effects on butterfly abundance and richness in
   gardens, including positive relationships with garden size, woodland and
   arable farmland and negative relationships with urbanisation. Both the
   presence and area of long grass in gardens were positively related to
   higher butterfly richness and abundance, with the latter being driven by
   butterflies that use grasses as larval host plants. These effects
   differed depending on the surrounding landscape, such that long grass
   resulted in higher garden butterfly abundance in landscapes dominated by
   arable farming, and higher abundance and richness in highly urbanised
   areas. The presence of flowering ivy ( Hedera spp.) in gardens resulted
   in higher abundance of Celastrina argiolus holly blue which uses ivy as
   a larval host, and of Vanessa atalanta red admiral and Polygonia c
   -album comma, which favour it as a nectar source. Our work provides
   evidence that undertaking simple wildlife-friendly garden practices can
   be beneficial for attracting butterflies, particularly in heavily
   modified areas. With over 728,000 ha of gardens in Great Britain, the
   cumulative effect of leaving areas of lawn uncut and providing nectar
   and larval host plants could be key for helping biodiversity.},

Title = {Evapotranspiration of Residential Lawns Across the United States},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {59},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite interest in the contribution of evapotranspiration (ET) of
   residential turfgrass lawns to household and municipal water budgets
   across the United States, the spatial and temporal variability of
   residential lawn ET across large scales is highly uncertain. We measured
   instantaneous ET (ETinst) of lawns in 79 residential yards in six
   metropolitan areas: Baltimore, Boston, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul
   (mesic climates), Los Angeles and Phoenix (arid climates). Each yard had
   one of four landscape types and management practices: traditional
   lawn-dominated yards with high or low fertilizer input, yards with
   water-conserving features, and yards with wildlife-friendly features. We
   measured ETinst in situ during the growing season using portable
   chambers and identified environmental and anthropogenic factors
   controlling ET in residential lawns. For each household, we used ETinst
   to estimate daily ET of the lawn (ETdaily) and multiplied ETdaily by the
   lawn area to estimate the total volume of water lost through ET of the
   lawn (ETvol). ETdaily varied from 0.9 +/- 0.4 mm d(1) in mesic cities to
   2.9 +/- 0.7 mm d(-1) in arid cities. Neither ETinst nor ETdaily was
   significantly influenced by yard landscape types and ETinst patterns
   indicated that lawns may be largely decoupled from regional rain-driven
   climate patterns. ETvol ranged from similar to 0 L d(-1) to over 2,000 L
   d(-1), proportionally increasing with lawn area. Current irrigation and
   lawn management practices did not necessarily result in different ETinst
   or ETdaily among traditional, water-conserving, or wildlife-friendly
   yards, but smaller lawn areas in water-conserving and wildlife-friendly
   yards resulted in lower ETvol.},

Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1413-1425},

Abstract = {Providing garden water sources (e.g., ponds, bird baths) has become a
   popular and strongly promoted form of wildlife-friendly gardening, yet
   evidence of their use by animals is scarce and limited to a few taxa and
   water source types. We examined the prevalence, variety and potential
   value to animal wildlife of supplementary water provided within gardens
   of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, using an online questionnaire and
   field observations of wildlife visitation to urban water sources during
   summer 2021. Over 70\% of 105 questionnaire respondents indicated the
   presence of at least one water source in their garden and almost 50\%
   had two or more. Bird baths, ground water-bowls and ponds were the most
   common water source types provided. During 207 h of field observation,
   we recorded a total of 43 taxa (birds, insects, mammals, amphibians,
   reptiles) visiting urban lakes and garden birth baths, ponds and ground
   water-bowls. Taxa richness was similar at urban lakes (30) and garden
   water sources (27), although approximately 50\% of the taxa recorded in
   each location were unique to that location. Visitation rates of
   smaller-bodied wildlife did not differ between lakes and gardens, nor
   among individual water source types. Multivariate analyses indicated
   insect assemblages visiting lakes did not differ from those visiting
   garden water sources, and small bird assemblages did not differ among
   each water source type. These results demonstrate garden water sources,
   especially for smaller-bodied animals, can supplement the wildlife
   values contributed by urban lake systems, and should continue to be
   promoted as an effective conservation action.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Cities are important sites for encouraging more widespread adoption of
   pro-environmental behaviors (PEB) that benefit humans and wildlife
   alike. Wildscaping, a type of stewardship PEB in which people create
   wildlife friendly gardens, has been promoted by conservation
   organizations, yet fundamental questions remain about what wildscaping
   entails and what factors contribute to sustained involvement. We used a
   social-ecological systems (SES) framework to examine behavior change
   among urban residents in Colorado who had received wildscape gardening
   certification and training. We employed semi-structured interviews (n =
   11), quantitative surveys (n = 63), participant observation, and
   document analysis, and analyzed data using grounded theoretical
   techniques. We found that program participants engaged in 14 gardening
   behaviors targeting habitat creation on their properties, and 11
   advocacy behaviors targeting social change. These behaviors were driven
   by 10 interconnected motivations, including mutual refuge with wildlife,
   changing norms, aesthetic beauty, and sense of place. Engagement in
   wildscaping was sustained over time by multi-scalar contextual factors,
   including social interactions and formal program participation. These
   findings offer the first SES understanding of how urban residents begin
   and expand their engagement in wildscape gardening and advocacy. Future
   research should focus on how understanding of SES characteristics can
   enable more effective behavior change programs in urban landscapes.
   Possible ways that conservation outreach could consider SES include
   encouraging evolving feedback loops between participants' motivations
   and behaviors, emphasizing reciprocal benefits to individuals and their
   social-ecological context, and promoting coordinated involvement by
   different types of actors at multiple scales of the system.},

Abstract = {Activities undertaken by householders in their gardens have huge
   potential to enhance city-wide biodiversity, but programs aimed at
   activating householders require an understanding of the factors
   encouraging or acting as barriers to the uptake of different kinds of
   activities. We provided 42 householders with two species-enhancing
   activities, selected from six possibilities, free-of-charge (to remove
   the barrier of initial cost). We collected socio-demographic data as
   well as information on knowledge of common urban species,
   pro-environmental behaviors and nature connectedness. We monitored
   ongoing engagement at two time points: 1 and 6 months. Characteristics
   of householders opting for different activities varied in terms of their
   degree of environmental engagement, their knowledge about common
   species, and the size of their gardens; e.g., bird feeders and bee
   planters were popular with people who did not know the names of common
   species and were not particularly engaged in pro-environmental
   activities respectively, whereas lizard habitat creation was attractive
   to people who were already engaged in wildlife gardening activities.
   Cost to continue with activities was a significant barrier for some
   people, but most householders were willing to practice relatively
   inexpensive activities in small spaces. Esthetics was an important
   factor to be considered when enhancing invertebrate habitat (e.g., bug
   hotels are more attractive than log piles, and planters for bees contain
   colorful flowers). A commonly cited barrier was lack of information
   about wildlife-friendly activities, despite much being available online.
   Most participants (85\%) talked about their activities with others,
   potentially acting as influencers and shifting social norms.},

Abstract = {Residential yards comprise a substantial portion of urban landscapes,

   may scale up to affect urban biodiversity. We conducted bird surveys and
   social surveys in Chicago-area (Illinois, USA) residential neighborhoods

   than environmental characteristics at the neighborhood or landscape
   scale. The ratio of evergreen to deciduous trees in yards and the
   percentage of yards with trees and plants with fruits or berries were
   positively associated with native bird species richness, whereas the
   number of outdoor cats had a negative association. The number of
   birdfeeders was not an important predictor for native species richness.
   We also found that migratory birds were observed on transects with more
   wildlife-friendly features in yards, and nonnative birds were observed
   on transects with greater numbers of outdoor cats and dogs. Our results
   highlight the potential importance of residential matrix management as a
   conservation strategy in urban areas.},

Title = {Closing the Gap: Communicating to Change Gardening Practices in Support
   of Native Biodiversity in Urban Private Gardens},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Private gardens collectively comprise the largest green space in most
   cities and the greatest potential for increasing the extent of
   wildlife-friendly and native-dominated habitat, improving the quality of
   ecosystem services, and providing opportunities for urban dwellers to
   reconnect with nature. Because attitudes and values driving landscape
   preferences in gardens are complex and often not conducive to
   biodiversity, and a gap exists between the possession of knowledge or
   values and the expression of pro-environmental behavior, facilitating
   change in gardening behavior is challenging. We attempted to improve
   knowledge and influence values, attitudes, and gardening behavior of 55
   householders in favor of native biodiversity and environmentally
   friendly practices, through a two-way communication process, or
   interactive dialog, during a process of biodiversity documentation of
   their gardens. Informative feedback on their garden with a normative
   component was also provided. Despite being well educated and
   knowledgeable about common species at the start of the study, an
   increase in knowledge and shift in attitude was detected in 64\% of
   householders: 40\% reported a greater understanding of wildlife, and
   26\% made changes in their gardens, 13\% to support native biodiversity.
   The normative component of our feedback information was of particular
   interest to 20\% of householders. Because neighborhood norms influence
   gardening practices, changes adopted by a proportion of householders
   should be perpetuated across neighborhoods. The process of biodiversity
   assessment, dialog, and feedback was effective in improving knowledge of
   wildlife and native species, and stimulated a shift in attitude that
   resulted in native-friendly gardening practices. These changes were
   detected primarily through open self-report questions, rather than
   quantitative measures.},

   barrier too far?},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Urban areas are associated with high levels of habitat fragmentation.
   For some terrestrial species with limited climbing abilities, property
   boundaries can pose a significant problem by limiting access to
   residential gardens. The West European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus)
   has declined markedly in the UK but is commonly found in areas of human
   habitation, including residential gardens. `Hedgehog Street' is a public
   engagement campaign aimed at recruiting volunteers ('Hedgehog
   Champions') to create access points ('hedgehog highways') across garden
   boundaries to improve habitat connectivity. In this study, we used a
   series of questionnaire surveys to explore motivations for and obstacles
   to the creation of highways. Householders were more likely to have
   created a highway if they were already aware of the Hedgehog Street
   campaign, if their garden contained a high number of wildlife-friendly
   features and if they considered watching wildlife to be important.
   Hedgehog Champions created, on average, 1.69 highways each with 52.0\%
   creating none; this would equate to an estimated >120,000 across all
   registered Champions. In comparison, 6.1-29.8\% of non-Champions stated
   that they had made a highway. However, most highways had been created in
   boundaries that could already be traversed via naturally occurring
   holes: only 11.4\% of garden boundaries could be traversed, and 3.2\% of
   gardens accessed, just via a hedgehog highway. In addition, only 5.0\%
   of gardens were considered totally inaccessible to hedgehogs. The most
   common reasons cited for not having made a highway were that
   householders' gardens were already accessible to hedgehogs followed by
   concerns relating to boundary ownership and / or communicating with
   neighbours. Future studies need to identify strategies for overcoming
   these obstacles to maximize citizen engagement, particularly with those
   householders who are not innately ``wildlife-friendly{''}, and to
   quantify the degree to which networks of highways affect patterns of
   individual movement and, ultimately, populations.},

Abstract = {Two consequences of the continued urbanisation of the human population
   are that a growing proportion of the landscape is less hospitable to,
   and that a growing proportion of people are disconnected from, native
   biodiversity. One response of the UK government has been to establish a
   goal, and an associated baseline indicator, of increasing the extent and
   range of public participation in gardening for wildlife. The formulation
   of policy to attain this end requires, however, insight into the factors
   that are associated with the level of participation. Here we examine the
   relationships, across 15 areas in five UK cities, between the proportion
   of households providing various garden features for wildlife or
   participating in various wildlife gardening activities, and housing
   densities and characteristics of the garden resource. We show that
   significant numbers of households participate in some form of wildlife
   gardening, but that the predominant form this participation takes is
   feeding wild birds. Key variables associated with spatial variation in
   wildlife gardening activities are the proportion of households with
   access to a garden and, more importantly, average garden size and the
   proportion of land cover by gardens. There was no evidence for strong
   effects of household density or the socio-economic status of
   householders on the prevalence of wildlife friendly features in gardens
   or on the participation by householders in activities to encourage
   wildlife. Our results suggest important considerations in attempts to
   increase awareness and participation in wildlife gardening.},

Title = {Wildlife gardening initiates a feedback loop to reverse the ``extinction
   of experience{''}},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {289},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Urbanization can cause the ``extinction of experience{''}, a feedback
   loop in which people who have little interaction with nature are less
   likely to protect it. This cycle could result in a continual erosion of
   biodiversity and fewer opportunities for people to experience nature.
   Alternatively, a sustainable version of this loop may occur which
   incorporates environmental engagement, or ``noticing nature.{''} Here we
   combine ecological and social data to provide the first empirical test
   of the full extinction of experience/noticing nature loop, using birds
   as a focal taxon. Our study included 815 urban residents from 25
   neighborhoods near Chicago, IL (USA). Residents were asked about their
   yard management and perceptions of birds in their neighborhoods. A
   researcher also documented the neighborhood bird communities. The social
   and ecological data were incorporated into a structural equation model
   to test the existence of a feedback loop. Our data confirm the existence
   of a loop but indicate that the relationship between people and birds is
   indirect rather than direct, suggesting that biodiversity changes are
   less important in the loop than residents' impressions of biodiversity.
   This is promising for urban conservation, because it suggests the cycle
   may continue even when the scale of management in an individual yard
   does not match the scale necessary for an immediate impact on wildlife.
   We therefore suggest that small wildlife-friendly changes to residential
   yards, in the aggregate, have the potential to reverse the extinction of
   experience and promote long-term increases in biodiversity.},

Volume = {226},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urbanization is increasing globally, with concomitant negative effects
   on biodiversity and human well-being. In urban areas, gardens may
   contribute to overall green space, bringing benefits to wildlife and
   residents. We used a community science approach to gather data and
   understand the role of urban gardens for wildlife and for residents in a
   developing country, where information on the subject is scarce. We
   evaluated how local characteristics and landscape quality influenced the
   presence of three native birds and two insect species as indicators of
   habitat conservation value, in a town immersed in an Argentinean
   National Park. We also estimated gardens' value during COVID-19
   quarantine to assess whether owners appreciated them more when outdoor
   activities were not allowed, increasing awareness of the value of nature
   for well-being. We found that most respondents enjoy birdwatching in
   their gardens and consider birds as beneficial; however, the pleasure of
   observing insects is lower. The relevance of local garden
   characteristics differed according to the species in question,
   highlighting the importance of using different species as indicators to
   assess garden conservation value. The proportion of tree cover
   surrounding the gardens had a positive effect on the probability of
   finding birds and insects, while the proportion of built-up area had a
   negative effect. During COVID-19 lockdown, most respondents enjoyed
   their gardens equally or more than usual, and those that assigned a
   monetary value to gardens, chose the highest one. We encouraged
   initiatives that engage, inform and empower residents on
   wildlife-friendly gardening to favor the inclusion of gardens as part of
   wider conservation and urban planning strategies.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {401-413},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Context The conservation value of residential landscapes is becoming
   increasingly apparent in our urbanizing world. The ecological
   characteristics of residential areas are largely determined by the
   decisions of many individual ``managers.{''} In these complex
   socio-ecological systems, it is important to understand the factors that
   motivate human decision-making.
   Objectives Our first objective was to quantify wildlife resources and
   management activities in residential landscapes and compare vegetation
   in front and back yards. Our second objective was to test three
   hypotheses linked with variation in yards: socioeconomic
   characteristics, neighborhood design factors, and perceptions of
   neighborhood birds.
   Methods We conducted surveys of over 900 residents in 25 Chicago-area
   neighborhoods to examine the wildlife resources contained in front and
   back yards and the social factors associated with variation in yards. We
   used a multi-scalar approach to examine among-yard and
   among-neighborhood variation in residential landscapes.
   Results Results indicate that back yards contain more wildlife resources
   than front yards, including greater vegetation complexity, more plants
   with fruit/berries, and more plants intended to attract birds.
   Furthermore, different hypotheses explain variation in front and back
   yards. Perceptions of birds were most important in explaining variation
   in back yard vegetation and wildlife-friendly resources per parcel,
   while neighbors' yards and socioeconomic characteristics best explained
   front yard vegetation.
   Conclusions This study demonstrates the importance of back yards as an
   unexplored and underestimated resource for biodiversity. In addition,
   the results provide insight into the complex factors linked with yard
   decisions, notably that residents' connections with neighborhood birds
   appear to translate to on-the-ground actions.},

Abstract = {In sprawling metropolitan areas, residential landscaping is a major
   concern with respect to biodiversity conservation, and it could play a
   critical role in conserving wildlife habitat. In the United States,
   residential landscaping typically consists of maintained lawns with
   specimen plantings of non-native trees and shrubs; such designs provide
   poor habitat for urban wildlife species. We conducted a case study of
   Raleigh, North Carolina residents to determine how providing information
   about the benefits of native plant landscaping to bird species
   influenced urban residents' landscaping preferences. We used Wilcoxon
   Signed Rank tests to determine if respondent preferences for 0, 50, 75
   and 100 \% native plant landscaping coverages changed after residents
   were informed about the benefits that native plants provide for birds.
   Initially, the 50 \% native landscaping coverage was most preferred by
   residents; however, preferences for all four native plant landscaping
   coverage designs were significantly different after the informational
   treatment. Neutrality changed to opposition for the 0 \% native plant
   coverage, while opposition changed to support and neutrality for the 75
   and 100 \% native plant coverage designs, respectively. After the
   informational treatment, the 50 and 75 \% native plant landscaping
   coverage had the highest mean preference levels, although the 100 \%
   design was ranked first more than any other design. Our findings suggest
   that residential support for native plant landscaping is higher than is
   reflected by typical residential landscaping practices, and that
   dissemination of information regarding the benefits of native plant
   landscaping to birds could alter public preferences for native plant
   landscaping.},

Title = {Woody cover does not promote activity of nest predators in residential
   yards},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {32-39},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Urban development often affects resource availability in ways that can
   influence not only community structure, but key species interactions
   that shape population dynamics. Although some resources are
   unintentionally altered, others are deliberately changed to improve
   habitat for urban wildlife, particularly songbirds. We hypothesized that
   management strategies that encourage planting trees and shrubs (i.e.
   increasing woody cover) would inadvertently attract predators of bird
   nests, which are generally abundant within cities. To test this, we
   examined the relationship between percent woody cover, pooled across
   trees and shrubs, and diurnal activity patterns of nest predators in
   residential yards. We surveyed predator activity and characterized
   habitat using aerial imagery of seven suburban neighborhoods in Franklin
   County, Ohio during April-August 2011 and 2012. Predator activity varied
   widely among individual yards, but contrary to our hypothesis, the
   availability of woody cover at either yard or neighborhood scales was
   not a strong predictor of diurnal activity in yards for five common
   species of nest predators (Eastern gray squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis;
   common grackle, Quiscalus quiscala; brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus
   ater; blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata; and domestic cat, Fells catus).
   Thus, our study suggests that wildlife habitat management or gardening
   programs that recommend increasing woody cover do not necessarily
   attract some common predators of songbird nests in Midwestern
   landscapes. Additional research that identifies which habitat features
   beyond woody cover best predict nest predator activity will facilitate
   the creation of management recommendations that increase the
   conservation value of urban environments for songbirds. (C) 2014

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {Wildlife are increasingly being found in urban habitats, and likely rely
   on some resources in suburban household yards, which exposes them to the
   effects of yard management and human and pet activities. We compared the
   relationships between these potential disturbances and benefits to the
   number of different types of wildlife sighted by householders, using
   written surveys. Owing to the inability of many household respondents to
   identify animals to the species or genus level, each different `type' of
   animal individually listed was counted to generate the total number of
   types of wildlife observed by each household. We found that relatively
   more types of wildlife were observed by residents whose yards provided
   ease of faunal access under or through fences, had reduced pesticide
   use, increased levels of anthropogenic noise, and increased presence of
   pets in yards. The latter two associations likely relate to the
   increased opportunities to observe wildlife in yards that each creates.
   We also investigated the use of yards by wildlife and domestic pets in
   open compared to more vegetated habitats by day and night, using
   motion-sensor cameras. All animals observed were compared to the
   activity of introduced brown and black rats (Rattus norvegicus, R.
   rattus), owing to their wild origins but long commensal history with
   humans. Camera images indicated that animals' natural activity periods
   were maintained in yards. Brown antechinuses (Antechinus stuartii),
   northern brown bandicoots (Isoodon macrourus), domestic cats (Felis
   catus) and native birds (species as listed below) each preferred
   sheltered or vegetated habitats over open habitats, when compared to the
   introduced rats that showed little habitat preference. However, unlike
   the other species, the native birds used open areas more than vegetated
   or sheltered areas when compared within their group only. The common
   brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) was observed to use open areas
   comparatively more than the introduced rats, but used vegetated or
   sheltered habitats more when compared to self only. The domestic dog
   (Canis familiaris) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) used open areas more than
   vegetated or sheltered areas, when compared to the introduced rats, and
   against themselves. This indicated a level of coping with urban
   stressors by the native animals, but with a reliance on more vegetated
   habitats to allow for natural stress-relieving behaviours of escape or
   hiding. Here, we offer insights into how each of these findings may be
   used to help educate and motivate increased household responsibility for
   urban wildlife conservation.},

Title = {Multi-Scalar Drivers of Residential Vegetation Changes in Metropolitan
   Phoenix, Arizona},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 21},
Abstract = {In the arid southwestern U.S., urban greening strategies have been
   promoted to alleviate ecosystem disservices associated with lawns,
   including the adoption of xeric yards with desert-adapted floras and
   gravel groundcover and wildlife-friendly yards with complex vegetation
   structure and composition. Scant studies have investigated the extent of
   different vegetation changes in urban greening practices and the
   complexity of associated human drivers. We addressed this gap by
   analyzing survey data from two survey periods (2017 and 2021) to answer
   the following questions: to what extent have residents from metropolitan
   Phoenix made different vegetation changes in their yards over the last
   decade, and how do multi-scalar human drivers affect different
   vegetation changes? We found a sustainable trajectory for residential
   vegetation changes in Phoenix since mid-2010s, with declining additions
   of grass and increases in trees and desert plants across residential
   neighborhoods. Esthetics was an influential driver of both tree planting
   and native gardening. Additionally, tree planting was associated with
   anthropocentric values (i.e., low-maintenance needs), while desert plant
   additions reflected the appreciation of nature (i.e., attitudes towards
   the desert) and environmental concerns (i.e., supporting wildlife).
   Institutions such as local government programs might shape residents'
   vegetation choices, as tree planting differed among municipalities. We
   also found counterintuitive influences of residential tenure controls on
   landscaping decisions. Specifically, renters were more likely to add
   yard trees compared to homeowners. Our results inform landscape
   sustainability by identifying potential pathways to residential yard
   changes that offer a multitude of services while being appreciated and
   maintained by residents.},

Title = {Garden centre customer attitudes to pollinators and pollinator-friendly
   planting},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Growing nectar- and pollen-rich flowering plant varieties in domestic
   gardens and other greenspace is an important pro-environmental behaviour
   that supports pollinating insects. Wildlife gardening is popular in the
   UK; however, public attitudes and behaviour relating to planting for
   pollinators are currently not well understood. We investigated these
   through questionnaires and interviews with customers in five garden
   centres in Sussex, southeast England, a relevant and useful consumer
   group representing horticulturally-engaged members of the public. Garden
   centre customers had strongly positive attitudes and were motivated to
   plant for bees and other pollinators: most (77\%) grew
   pollinator-friendly varieties, while 64\% would be more likely to buy a
   plant with a pollinator-friendly logo. Personal motivation to support
   pollinators was linked to a recent increase in personal and public
   awareness of their declines through (often negativistic) information
   from mass media sources. Practical implications of these findings in
   relation to the horticultural retail industry are discussed.},

Title = {Biodiversity in residential gardens: a review of the evidence base},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {32},
Number = {13},
Pages = {4155-4179},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Residential gardens are a principal component of urban green
   infrastructure throughout the world and their potential positive
   contributions to biodiversity are increasingly recognised. But the
   characteristics of gardens reflect the needs, values and interests of
   individual households. The present review summarises evidence from
   studies of garden biodiversity published in the scientific literature,
   describes major themes and identifies important knowledge gaps. A search
   of the Web of Science database identified 408 published articles on the
   biodiversity of residential gardens (1981-2022), with numbers increasing
   over time and a strong bias towards Europe (32.1\%) and North America
   (23.8\%). Plants and invertebrates were most frequently studied, and
   species diversity was often correlated with garden size and habitat
   complexity. Botanic composition and vegetation cover were often
   positively associated with the diversity and abundance of fauna.
   Non-native plants contributed substantially to garden plant diversity
   and evidence from some studies indicated benefits to other species
   linked to their functional attributes. Intensive management including
   frequent lawn mowing, fertiliser and pesticide application, and a more
   formal, `neater' garden appearance were often associated with reduced
   biodiversity. However, results varied amongst studies, for example in
   relation to the impacts of mowing frequency on lawn diversity. There was
   a general paucity of experimental evidence on the impacts of different
   management regimes on garden biodiversity and few replicated
   experimental tests of recommended `wildlife-friendly practices'. Several
   studies identified the importance of connectivity amongst gardens and
   with other green infra-structure for species dispersal and ecosystem
   functioning. Emerging threats to garden biodiversity include their
   replacement by development, conversion to hard surfaces and declining
   plot sizes. Managing these challenges and maximising the biodiversity
   value of residential gardens requires greater engagement from
   policymakers and planners, and partnerships between public bodies and
   private households to co-ordinate local initiatives.},

Title = {Residential yard management and landscape cover affect urban bird
   community diversity across the continental USA},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urbanization has a homogenizing effect on biodiversity and leads to
   communities with fewer native species and lower conservation value.
   However, few studies have explored whether or how land management by
   urban residents can ameliorate the deleterious effects of this
   homogenization on species composition. We tested the effects of local
   (land management) and neighborhood-scale (impervious surface and tree
   canopy cover) features on breeding bird diversity in six US metropolitan
   areas that differ in regional species pools and climate. We used a
   Bayesian multiregion community model to assess differences in species
   richness, functional guild richness, community turnover, population
   vulnerability, and public interest in each bird community in six land
   management types: two natural area park types (separate and adjacent to
   residential areas), two yard types with conservation features
   (wildlife-certified and water conservation) and two lawn-dominated yard
   types (high- and low-fertilizer application), and surrounding
   neighborhood-scale features. Species richness was higher in yards
   compared with parks; however, parks supported communities with high
   conservation scores while yards supported species of high public
   interest. Bird communities in all land management types were composed of
   primarily native species. Within yard types, species richness was
   strongly and positively associated with neighborhood-scale tree canopy
   cover and negatively associated with impervious surface. At a
   continental scale, community turnover between cities was lowest in yards
   and highest in parks. Within cities, however, turnover was lowest in
   high-fertilizer yards and highest in wildlife-certified yards and parks.
   Our results demonstrate that, across regions, preserving natural areas,
   minimizing impervious surfaces and increasing tree canopy are essential
   strategies to conserve regionally important species. However, yards,
   especially those managed for wildlife support diverse, heterogeneous
   bird communities with high public interest and potential to support
   species of conservation concern. Management approaches that include the
   preservation of protected parks, encourage wildlife-friendly yards and
   acknowledge how public interest in local birds can advance successful
   conservation in American residential landscapes.},

Title = {Municipal regulation of residential landscapes across US cities:
   Patterns and implications for landscape sustainability},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {275},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Local regulations on residential landscapes (yards and gardens) can
   facilitate or constrain ecosystem services and disservices in cities. To
   our knowledge, no studies have undertaken a comprehensive look at how
   municipalities regulate residential landscapes to achieve particular
   goals and to control management practices. Across six U.S. cities, we
   analyzed 156 municipal ordinances to examine regional patterns in local
   landscape regulations and their implications for sustainability.
   Specifically, we conducted content analysis to capture regulations aimed
   at: 1) goals pertaining to conservation and environmental management,
   aesthetics and nuisance avoidance, and health and wellbeing, and 2)
   management actions including vegetation maintenance, water and waste
   management, food production, and chemical inputs. Our results reveal
   significant variation in local and regional regulations. While
   regulatory goals stress stormwater management and nuisance avoidance,
   relatively few municipalities explicitly regulate residential yards to
   maintain property values, mitigate heat, or avoid allergens. Meanwhile,
   biological conservation and water quality protection are common goals,
   yet regulations on yard management practices (e.g., non-native plants or
   chemical inputs) sometimes contradict these purposes. In addition,
   regulations emphasizing aesthetics and the maintenance of vegetation,
   mowing of grass and weeds, as well as the removal of dead wood, may
   inhibit wildlife-friendly yards. As a whole, landscaping ordinances
   largely ignore tradeoffs between interacting goals and outcomes, thereby
   limiting their potential to support landscape sustainability.
   Recommendations therefore include coordinated, multiobjective planning
   through partnerships among planners, developers, researchers, and
   non-government entities at multiple scales.},

Title = {Contradiction and Complacency Shape Attitudes towards the Toll of Roads
   on Wildlife},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary: Mitigating the toll of roads on wildlife can become
   difficult when awareness and exposure does not result in willingness to
   change driving behaviour. Using a self-reporting questionnaire, we found
   that while most drivers view wildlife vehicle collisions as a serious
   issue, increasing exposure to collisions decreased this attitude and it
   did not translate into willingness to adopt additional mitigation
   strategies. In addition, despite most respondents stating they routinely
   drive slower when collision risk is high (at dusk and dawn), our
   assessment of driving trends via traffic speeds suggested this sentiment
   was not generally adhered to. We suggest that competing priorities and
   complacency when risk to people is low may adversely affect willingness
   to prevent collisions.
   Abstract: Most people in the world now live in cities. Urbanisation
   simultaneously isolates people from nature and contributes to
   biodiversity decline. As cities expand, suburban development and the
   road infrastructure to support them widens their impact on wildlife.
   Even so, urban communities, especially those on the peri-urban fringe,
   endeavour to support biodiversity through wildlife friendly gardens,
   green spaces and corridors, and conservation estates. On one hand, many
   who live on city fringes do so because they enjoy proximity to nature,
   however, the ever increasing intrusion of roads leads to conflict with
   wildlife. Trauma (usually fatal) to wildlife and (usually emotional and
   financial) to people ensues. Exposure to this trauma, therefore, should
   inform attitudes towards wildlife vehicle collisions (WVC) and be linked
   to willingness to reduce risk of further WVC. While there is good
   anecdotal evidence for this response, competing priorities and better
   understanding of the likelihood of human injury or fatalities, as
   opposed to wildlife fatalities, may confound this trend. In this paper
   we sought to explore this relationship with a quantitative study of
   driver behaviour and attitudes to WVC from a cohort of residents and
   visitors who drive through a peri-urban reserve (Royal National Park) on
   the outskirts of Sydney, Australia. We distributed a self-reporting
   questionnaire and received responses from 105 local residents and 51
   visitors to small townships accessed by roads through the national park.
   We sought the respondents' exposure to WVC, their evasive actions in an
   impending WVC, their attitudes to wildlife fatalities, their strategies
   to reduce the risk of WVC, and their willingness to adopt new
   ameliorative measures. The results were partitioned by driver
   demographics and residency. Residents were generally well informed about
   mitigation strategies but exposure led to a decrease in viewing WVC as
   very serious. In addition, despite most respondents stating they
   routinely drive slower when collision risk is high (at dusk and dawn),
   our assessment of driving trends via traffic speeds suggested this
   sentiment was not generally adhered to. Thus we unveil some of the
   complexities in tackling driver's willingness to act on reducing risk of
   WVC, particularly when risk of human trauma is low.},

   Using front yard surveys, we found a greater mean percent cover of
   native species in PEC yards (29.51\%) compared to non-PEC yards (6.94\%)
   and less mean percent lawn cover in PEC yards (38.44\%) than non-PEC
   yards (68.04\%). While these results suggest that PECs are an

Abstract = {This qualitative study explores how urban gardeners were supported to

   A development phase follows where connections to place deepen;
   stewardship knowledge, competencies and activities strengthen; and
   commitment to stewardship increases through learning by doing, supported
   by rewarding results, validation, community involvement, and accessible

Abstract = {This study investigates pro-environmental behavior (PEB) in Bhutan by
   using Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Norm Activation Model
   (NAM). We conducted an online survey with 1348 participants representing
   diverse age, gender, and residential demographics. We found that the
   silent generation in Bhutan had lower PEB engagement than Generation Z,
   while Generation Y exhibits less involvement in recycling behaviors,
   with gender exerting no significant influence. Notably, rural residents
   had greater participation in personal gardening but lesser engagement in
   recycling, while urban residents practiced more recycling and water
   conservation. Education emerges as a positive factor impacting PEB
   engagement, alongside socio-psychological dispositions like personal
   norms, social norms, locus of control, awareness of consequences, and
   intention to act. Additionally, the high prevalence of plastic bag usage
   in the population calls for policy attention. We recommend that
   policymakers and environmental advocates in Bhutan consider age-specific
   PEB campaigns, the establishment of urban garden-friendly spaces,
   advocacy for alternatives to plastic packaging, and enhanced waste
   management services in rural areas as essential steps toward fostering
   sustainable environment in Bhutan.},

Pages = {364-384},
Abstract = {Reducing the food-related carbon footprint is an important part of
   climate change mitigation. Given a growing global population and rapid
   urbanization, shifting contemporary carbon-intensive food consumption
   trends is essential. As such, encouraging pro-environmental behaviour
   change and pro-environmental food consumption behaviour in particular is
   as an important challenge; reducing our collective foodprint is an
   important way of reducing our collective carbon footprint. Yet, despite
   widespread consumer awareness of climate change, consumption behaviours
   are rarely consistent with environmentally friendly aspirations. This
   empirical research emphasizes the contribution and the potential of
   community gardens as a means of fostering pro-environmental behaviour
   change towards low-carbon food consumption. It evaluates the role of
   London's community gardens in promoting participants' environmentally
   friendly food consumption patterns, thereby lowering London's foodprint
   on the consumer side. To collect data, ninety-five community gardens in
   London were asked to circulate an online survey to their gardeners. In
   total, forty-eight community gardeners responded to the survey. These
   responses were complemented with semi-structured interviews held with
   community garden participants. The paper investigates London community
   gardeners' food consumption patterns including food self-sufficiency,
   food shopping habits, dietary choices, and food waste management in
   terms of their carbon footprint. In addition, it verifies that the
   timespan of community garden participation is not an absolute indicator
   of low-carbon food consumption choices, despite its influence on certain
   changes. It also accounts for experiential and social learning as the
   two key aspects of community gardening that promote gardeners'
   behavioural change, resulting in a lower foodprint in daily life.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Scientists have classed the ongoing decline in biodiversity-caused by
   humans-as a mass extinction. To mitigate the consequences of this
   extinction, immediate action is of the utmost importance. However,
   effective ways of promoting pro-nature conservation behaviours to
   preserve and enhance biodiversity require better understanding and
   measurement. Thus, a reliable and valid measurement tool is needed.
   While there are measurement tools for general pro-environmental
   behaviours, as of yet, no measure of behaviours that specifically
   promote biodiversity exists. Here, we present such a tool: the
   Pro-Nature Conservation Behaviour Scale (ProCoBS), a psychometrically
   validated questionnaire scale measuring active behaviours that
   specifically support the conservation of biodiversity. An item pool
   developed through consultation with wildlife and biodiversity experts
   was subjected to psychometric scale development analyses. Data from 300
   participants were used to develop the 18-item ProCoBS long form, as well
   as an 8-item short form. A latent variable model with four factors
   (Individual Engagement, Social Engagement, Planting, and Wildlife) was
   identified. In a second study, a subset of 250 of the original
   participants answered the questionnaire again, in addition to related
   psychological constructs. The data were used to assess test-retest
   reliability and construct validity. Results showed that the scale and
   its short form were reliable (full scale: alpha = 0.893, short form:
   alpha = 0.825) and valid. In a third study, a representative sample of
   1298 adults in the UK completed the short form. Confirmatory Factor
   Analysis demonstrated a good fit for all factors, indicating that the
   ProCoBS is a psychometrically robust measure. The ProCoBS provides the
   definitive, much needed tool for measuring conservation behaviours. This
   will enhance research and impact practical work in the conservation
   domain for a sustainable future. A cross-cultural examination of the
   scale is still needed.},

Title = {The role of edible cities supporting sustainability transformation - A
   conceptual multi-dimensional framework tested on a case study in Germany},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {255},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Cities have become major contributors to sustainability problems and, in
   the meantime, seedbeds for sustainability transformation. Urban
   nature-based solutions, such as greening strategies that foster urban
   food production as a cross-cutting issue, promise to have
   multidimensional benefits for sustainable urban development. However, a
   conceptual understanding of interlinkages between nature-based solutions
   and their contribution to sustainability transformation is lacking. The
   goals of this study are twofold. First, to develop a conceptual model
   for testing multi-dimensional impacts of urban nature-based solutions
   supporting social-spatial, social-ecological and individual sustainable
   transformation. The model has been developed based on the concepts of
   place attachment, human-food connection and pro-environmental food
   behaviour. Second, the conceptual model is applied to the example of
   edible cities. Edible cities can be considered an innovative
   nature-based solution that provides multiple cobenefits by offering
   (free) food for urban residents in public spaces. A Principal Component
   Analysis of a survey among residents of Andernach (N = 380), one of the
   first edible cities in Germany revealed, in contrast to the conceptual
   three-dimensional model, a four-dimensional model with high construct
   validity and reliability. The model comprises a) place attachment, b)
   experiential and c) material human-food connection as well as d)
   pro-environmental food consumption. Items of internal emotional and
   philosophical human-food connection included within the
   pro-environmental food consumption scale suggested their important role
   in fostering sustainability. Results suggest that the edible city can be
   considered a strategy for increasing urban attractiveness and place
   identity, supporting social bonding and experiential human-food
   connection by using the edible areas for nature observation and
   recreation. However, although the residents are well informed about the
   edible city concept, most residents are not actively involved and rarely
   use the food provided by the edible city. Thus, they also could not
   answer questions related to cognitive human-food connection such as
   estimating the food's taste and health quality. To strengthen material
   and cognitive human-food connection, policy implications of the results
   propose the implementation of accompanying information and participation
   activities. By linking nature-based solutions with sustainability
   transformation, this study provides conceptual and practical
   implications for the multidimensional benefits of innovative urban
   greening strategies such as edible cities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Modeling the Influence of Public Risk Perceptions on the Adoption of
   Green Stormwater Infrastructure: An Application of Bayesian Belief
   Networks Versus Logistic Regressions on a Statewide Survey of Households
   in Vermont},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There is growing environmental psychology and behavior literature with
   mixed empirical evidence about the influence of public risk perceptions
   on the adoption of environmentally friendly ``green behaviors{''}.
   Adoption of stormwater green infrastructure on residential properties,
   while costlier in the short term compared to conventional greywater
   infrastructure, plays an important role in the reduction of nutrient
   loading from non-point sources into freshwater rivers and lakes. In this
   study, we use Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to analyze a 2015 survey
   dataset (sample size = 472 respondents) about the adoption of green
   infrastructure (GSI) in Vermont's residential areas, most of which are
   located in either the Lake Champlain Basin or Connecticut River Basin.
   Eight categories of GSI were investigated: roof diversion, permeable
   pavement, infiltration trenches, green roofs, rain gardens, constructed
   wetlands, tree boxes, and others. Using both unsupervised and supervised
   machine learning algorithms, we used Bayesian Belief Networks to
   quantify the influence of public risk perceptions on GSI adoption while
   accounting for a range of demographic and spatial variables. We also
   compare the effectiveness of the Bayesian Belief Network approach and
   logistic regression in predicting the pro-environmental behaviors
   (adoption of GSI). The results show that influencing factors for current
   adoption differ by the type of GSI. Increased perception of risk from
   stormwater issues is associated with the adoption of rain gardens and
   infiltration trenches. Runoff issues are more likely to be considered
   the governments' (town, state, and federal agencies) responsibility,
   whereas lawn erosion is more likely to be considered the residents'
   responsibility. When using the same set of variables to predict
   pro-environmental behaviors (adoption of GSI), the BBN approach produces
   more accurate predictions compared to logistic regression. The results
   provide insights for further research on how to encourage residents to
   take measures for mitigating stormwater issues and stormwater
   management.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3, SI},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Urbanization is increasingly compromising residents' connection to
   natural habitats and landscapes. With established relationships between
   human-nature connection (HNC) and pro-environmental behaviour and human
   well being, there are calls for effective interventions to strengthen
   HNC in urban settings. However, much of this research has
   operationalised HNC in narrow psychological terms. Based on an embodied
   framework of urban human-food connection (HFC) as a specific dimension
   of HNC, this article explores the role of active urban gardening in
   promoting different types of internal and external HFC and their link
   with pro-environmental food behaviour (PEFB). Based on a quantitative
   survey in Germany addressing vegetable gardeners in Munich (N = 254), a
   principal component analysis extracted four components of HFC comprising
   external body-related HFC (i.e. immediate urban garden-body activities:
   food harvesting and experiential food interaction) and internal
   mind-related HFC (i.e. immediate urban garden-mind activities including
   food discovery as well as food consciousness). These were found to be
   statistically related to one another. Furthermore, regression analysis
   revealed that food consciousness through concerns on food consumption
   and environmental impacts as well as food as part of life attitude as an
   internal HFC is the sole predictor of PEFB. The study suggests an
   embodied HFC model emphasizing the need for local body- and mind-based
   nature connections for fostering earth stewardship. Future research
   should explore the relationship between inner dimensions of nature
   connectedness and external behavioural change to enable transformations
   towards sustainability.},

Abstract = {The purported environmental, social, psychological, and economic
   benefits of urban agricultural initiatives (UAIs) are context-dependent.
   However, little research has been done on UAIs in Asia, and to our
   knowledge, no research conducted in Singapore. This study investigated
   the benefits perceived by employees and volunteers at an UAI in
   Singapore, an Asian city-state, and how these benefits were achieved or
   impeded. A secondary aim was to examine differences in participants'
   perceptions. To address these aims, in-depth interviews were conducted
   with 13 employees and volunteers, followed by a Q-sort of 36 interview
   statements delivered to the same participants. The results suggested
   that the UAI had environmental, social, and psychological benefits which
   include fostering a genuine connection with nature and facilitating
   pro-environmental behavioural spillover; enabling friendships and
   learning to communicate with diverse peoples; and increasing
   self-awareness and gratitude, respectively. These are facilitated
   through tactile involvement with nature, exposure to pro-environmental
   behaviours, a culture of open-mindedness that encourages social
   interaction and encouragement of reflection. On the other hand, the
   UAI's economic impact in terms of employment and food production was
   impeded by its financial difficulties. While both volunteers and
   employees perceived the psychosocial benefits, it was employees who
   emphasised the UAI's financial difficulties. These benefits and
   impediments and how they manifest reflect Singapore's communitarian
   worldview and accompanying social norms, and demonstrate the local and
   global relevance of situating UAIs in context. Relevant areas of future
   research are suggested. (234 words)},

Abstract = {Urbanisation is increasing, while global biodiversity is decreasing.
   Through `urban rewilding' cities could help tackle this biodiversity
   crisis, while exploiting the benefits of urban nature for residents.
   Private residential gardens, which have potential to support significant
   biodiversity, should be a primary focus. Yet their proportion of
   vegetated space is decreasing through changes made by residents,
   negatively impacting biodiversity. Small adaptations to private gardens
   can turn them into wildlife habitat, but understanding residents'
   behaviour is critical to developing intervention strategies for this.
   This paper presents a scoping review of existing literature on
   understanding intent-orientated, pro-environmental behaviours with a
   focus on rewilding in urban gardens. The literature is mapped to assess
   the state of knowledge; it is then coded, using the `COM-B' model of
   behaviour, to identify the capability, opportunity and motivation
   factors forming barriers and facilitators to residents engaging in
   rewilding activity in their gardens. The results show that all COM-B
   factors need to be considered to understand urban rewilding behaviour,
   but that opportunity and motivation factors have more influence,
   particularly reflective motivation. They indicate that facilitators are
   more significant than barriers and highlight an important body of work
   that has implications for practice and policy aimed at influencing urban
   rewilding.},

Abstract = {Western Australia (WA) is experiencing severe water shortages associated
   with a drying climate. Suburban gardens in and around WA's capital city
   of Perth however, continue to be dominated by water dependent European
   style gardens featuring green lawns and introduced species. One area in
   metropolitan Perth going against this norm is the local government
   district of Fremantle. Residents within this city council have shown
   widespread adoption of native gardens: a seemingly obvious means of
   reducing water use and increasing local biodiversity. In an endeavour to
   understand the differences in garden design preferences, the aim of this
   research was to explore cultural and psychological drivers of native
   gardening within the city of Fremantle. Twelve in-depth, face-to-face
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with Fremantle homeowners.
   Participants had converted their garden from a traditional European
   design in favour of an aesthetic based on native species. Drivers such
   as knowledge, functionality, and social norms emerged, and interestingly
   resembled the same sorts of drivers previously identified as driving
   European style gardening practices in Australia. We account for the
   tension of same drivers yet different design due to differences in
   social and cultural values. Specifically, the dominant worldview in
   Fremantle is pro-environmental and this driver appears to shape the
   social context in which gardening decisions are made, making for a more
   accepting setting for residents to adopt alternative garden designs.
   Findings from this research are of value to water and environmental
   policy makers, urban local governments, and environmental educators. (c)

Title = {The influence of naturalness of the landscape structure on children's
   connectedness to Nature in north-eastern Italy},
Journal = {ONE ECOSYSTEM},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 29},
Abstract = {Connectedness to Nature and the ability to perceive the restorative
   value of places characterised by the presence of natural elements are
   personal characteristics that, when appropriately measured, make it
   possible to predict an individual's attitude towards pro-environmental
   behaviour. While these characteristics have an innate basis, they are
   also shaped by personal experiences and various cognitive, affective and
   sociocultural factors. In this exploratory study in North-eastern Italy,
   we delve into an interdisciplinary field that explores the relationship
   between the environment of the residential area and its impact on
   children's attitudes toward Nature. To do so, we conducted a
   comprehensive questionnaire amongst 533 primary schoolchildren, aged
   6-11 years, to gauge their connectedness to Nature, their perceptions of
   restorativeness in surrounding natural settings, and their schoolyard
   environment. Drawing from optical satellite imageries, we calculated a
   combined multispectral index to assess the naturalness degree of
   participants' residential areas, focusing on their 68 residential areas,
   located in three administrative Italian Regions (Trentino Alto Adige,
   Friuli Venezia Giulia and Veneto), which were classified into four
   different classes with respect to their level of presence of natural
   areas ({''}coastal,{''} ``low,{''} ``average,{''} ``high{''}). By
   performing non-parametric tests for multiple comparisons amongst groups,
   we detected a significantly higher level of connectedness to Nature
   amongst children living in areas with high naturalness, compared to
   those living in areas with average or low naturalness. Perceived
   restorativeness scores exhibit a similar trend to that of connectedness
   to Nature, reinforcing the importance of natural spaces in fostering
   positive attitudes towards the environment. This result confirms that
   accessibility and the viewability of natural spaces, even semi-natural
   ones, seemed to play a crucial role in children's preference for these
   environments. However, schoolyards were consistently perceived as less
   regenerative than natural places, regardless of the naturalness of the
   neighbourhood. These findings raise intriguing questions about the
   potential consequences of inadequate exposure to Nature on children's
   affiliation to the natural world and possible subsequent effects on
   pro-environmental behaviour in adulthood. By shedding light on the
   complex interplay between personal characteristics, environment and
   attitudes towards Nature, our study underscores the significance of
   fostering a deeper connection with natural spaces to nurture a
   sustainable and environmentally conscious society.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The prevention and the proper management of household food waste
   represents a dramatic and collective challenge. Home composting provides
   an excellent opportunity to recycle biowaste at source, therefore, it
   should be promoted to the public. The practice of home composting is
   influ-enced by a set of complex mechanisms, including motivation,
   attitude, and behaviour. Consumer research is needed to define segments
   of the society and to design targeted interventions. This in-vestigation
   is the first representative study analysing the habits and behaviours of
   household gar-den waste and food waste composting in Hungary. The aim
   was to explore composting practices of Hungarian households, and to
   identify the perceived advantages, barriers and incentives. The paper
   also examined the relationship between pro-environmental attitudes, food
   wastage and composting habits. The research is based on a quantitative
   (n = 1002) consumer survey repre-sentative of the adult population of
   Hungary in terms of sex, age and geographical distribution. The results
   indicate that 31\% of the respondents compost garden waste and food
   waste in the household. Lack of space and proper knowledge were defined
   as barriers. Utilization of humus and decreasing the quantity of solid
   waste are the main perceived benefits. According to the re-sults,
   pro-environmental attitude and less wasteful behaviour positively
   affects the habit of com-posting. A combined cluster analysis was
   conducted to segment the respondents. Four distinct groups have been
   identified: Average composters; Uninterested urban citizens; Helpless
   apart-ment residents; Active environmentalists. The results deliver some
   policy implications to promote home composting, especially for young
   people and families with children.},

Abstract = {Research has demonstrated that residential yards can provide important
   habitat for urban birds, pollinators, and other wildlife. In addition,
   the motivations and constraints underlying decisions to manage
   traditional lawns, water-conserving yards, native plants, and other
   landscape types are well understood. Yet relatively little research has

   Analyzing survey data from six U.S. cities, we address three related
   questions: 1) to what extent do residents choose yard features that
   support wildlife habitat?; 2) how do yard priorities and neighborhood
   governance, along with socio-demographic factors, explain the adoption
   of wildlife-supporting features?; and 3) how do residents who have
   already adopted wildlife-supporting yard features differ in their
   motivations from those who plan to adopt such features and those who do
   not? We found significant potential for adding vegetation (specifically
   shrubs and native plants) and other wildlife-supporting features to
   increase yard complexity and vegetation diversity. While gardening as a
   hobby was a significant motivator for people who have adopted wildlife
   yard features, the desire for low maintenance yards is a constraint
   among non-adopters. We therefore recommend promoting the planting of
   low-maintenance plant species or varieties that provide wildlife habitat
   but require little upkeep, especially among residents who would like to
   attract wildlife to their yards into the future. We also found that
   neighbourhood and homeowner associations increase the local adoption of
   wildlife-supporting yards. Coupled with other findings, our results
   underscore the importance of tailoring residential landscape features to
   diverse lifestyles while leveraging social institutions to expand
   wildlife habitat across urban and suburban neighborhoods.},

Title = {Environmental attitudes predict native plant abundance in residential
   yards},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {224},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Native plant landscaping can provide unique support for native wildlife
   in urban settings, but the drivers of native plant inclusion in private
   residential yards are not well characterized. As with other
   pro-environmental behaviors, native plant landscaping is likely driven
   by a combination of resident and landscape attributes. We ask, how do
   resident attitudes, knowledge, plant choice priorities, demographics,
   and parcel structure predict existing native plant abundance? To address
   this question, we compared resident characteristics with front yard
   woody vegetation in 105 parcels in Phoenix, Arizona. Although many
   residents had positive attitudes toward native plants, less than a third
   of woody plants in most yards were native. Native woody plant abundance
   was higher in xeric rock-covered yards where residents believed native
   plants belonged in the city, prioritized choosing native plants, and had
   higher household income. Reported knowledge about native plants was low,
   but did not predict native woody plant abundance. Although native plants
   in the arid environment of Phoenix are adapted to low water conditions,
   residents who prioritized low water use plant selection had fewer native
   plants, highlighting an opportunity for native plant marketing. These
   results suggest that educational campaigns to increase resident
   knowledge of native plant identification and care are unlikely to result
   in greater native plant abundance in the residential landscape.
   Marketing native plants to highlight qualities such as low water needs
   and addressing barriers such as horticultural availability and expense
   should be further investigated as potential methods of increasing native
   plant resources in urban environments.},

Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Private gardens have an enormous impact on urban biodiversity, making
   individual householder behavior critical to the conservation and
   enhancement of biodiversity in urban areas. Nature connectedness is
   considered to be a prerequisite for proenvironmental behavior, but how
   it manifests in private gardens is largely unexplored. Nature
   connectedness has also been found to be associated with several
   well-being dimensions. The present study investigates the associations
   between nature connectedness, biodiversity of private gardens, and
   mental wellbeing during the Covid-19 lockdown, a stressful period in
   many people's lives. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to
   analyze data from an online survey of private gardeners in two cities,
   one in Germany and one in New Zealand, in May 2020, approximately two
   months after the beginning of the first Covid-19 lockdown. Garden
   characteristics explained a significant amount of variance in depression
   symptoms during the Covid-19 lockdown. In light of rising pressures on
   urban green spaces, the findings point to the importance of private
   garden qualities for mental health and well-being. Nature connectedness
   emerged as a significant predictor of feature richness, a measure of the
   heterogeneity of habitats that support wildlife, and plant growth form
   richness in people's gardens in both city samples. Nature connectedness
   was also a significant predictor of the extent to which people
   experienced positive emotions during the Covid-19 lockdown but not
   negative emotions and depression symptoms. Our results suggest that
   nature connectedness can provide benefits for both the environment and
   people through its positive association with private garden biodiversity
   and positive emotions.},

   relations with the nonhuman context of the yard as cooperative,
   oppositional, and negotiable. We call for social science in urban spaces
   to be more explicitly informed by a consideration of nonhuman agency,

   sustainable practices of its student residents. The hall provides an
   immersive learning environment, offering hands-on activities such as

   this study gathered quantitative data through a questionnaire on

   significant enhancement in environmental awareness among students with
   more than two semesters of residence in the hall. Qualitative research
   explored the impact of residential hall experiences on the residents'
   environmental mindset, uncovering three themes: immersive experiences,
   long-term habituation, and the visibility of outcomes. These findings
   suggest that living in a sustainability-themed residential hall shapes
   students' environmental attitudes and behaviors, reinforcing the value
   of integrating residential education within Environmental Sustainability
   Education (ESE) frameworks. This study highlights the potential of

Abstract = {Within the expanding city of Brisbane in south-east Queensland, numerous
   fragments of native and regrowth vegetation are scattered across the
   largely urbanised landscape. These fragments provide refuge to a great
   diversity of native wildlife, and, provide residents with the
   opportunity to experience nature on their doorstep. To assess the
   diversity and abundance of this wildlife, recent changes in these
   parameters, and the value of wildlife and bushland fragments to
   residents of Brisbane, a questionnaire survey was distributed to 300
   households each located adjacent to one of 38 urban bushland fragments.
   A total of 172 surveys (57\%) were returned, producing 768 records of 83
   fauna species, dominated by birds and mammals; bandicoots were widely
   reported from the 38 fragments. Several historical records provided
   evidence of recent local extinctions within fragments, highlighting the
   continuing declines in various species of native wildlife within
   Brisbane. Several human-wildlife conflicts were identified, but overall
   residents were tolerant of such conflicts. Bandicoots were disliked by a
   small minority (3\%) of residents owing to the holes they dig in lawns
   and gardens in search of food. and their potential as vectors of ticks.
   Most respondents expressed ail appreciation for the presence of native
   wildlife (96\%) and bushland fragments (97\%) in their local area,
   emphasising the importance of incorporating human dimension values into
   the management of this urban biodiversity.},

Title = {Barriers to Native Plantings in Private Residential Yards},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In urban areas, private yards can make up large portions of the
   available ``green space{''} which can be used to provide resources for
   many species, including birds, and pollinators. If residents are
   persuaded or willing to plant certain native plants, the aggregate
   effect of these plantings could be hugely beneficial for key pollinator
   species. The objectives of this study are to uncover impediments to
   adding different types of pollinator-beneficial plants to private yards,
   as well as ascertain which incentives to plant these native plants might
   be most persuasive, and finally determine if there are procedural
   knowledge gaps in how to plant, care for, or where to purchase three
   pollinator-beneficial plants. In this study, we randomly selected
   properties in two counties in southwestern Ohio along two gradients:
   parcel size and parcel valuation (as a proxy for income). Two hundred
   surveys were distributed and 113 were returned (57\% response rate). We
   find that, in aggregate, respondents do not have a strong intent to
   plant these native plants, especially Asclepias syriaca (a milkweed that
   serves as host plant to the iconic monarch butterfly; Danaus plexippus)
   and, surprisingly, the intent to plant these does not differ
   statistically even when help with costs, labor, or the provision of
   online resources are offered. We also find that the reported knowledge
   of where to purchase wildflowers is significantly higher than how to
   care for them and how to plant them. Lastly, respondents are much more
   confident in how to take care of trees compared to the three
   pollinator-beneficial plants shown in the survey. We discuss the
   implications of these findings for outreach and extension purposes.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {The human footprint is rapidly expanding, and wildlife habitat is
   continuously being converted to human residential properties. Surviving
   wildlife that reside in developing areas are displaced to nearby
   undeveloped areas. However, some animals can co-exist with humans and
   acquire the necessary resources (food, water, shelter) within the human
   environment. This ability to coexist may be particularly true when
   development is low intensity, as in residential suburban yards. Yards
   are individually managed ``greenspaces{''} that can provide a range of
   food (e.g., bird feeders, compost, gardens), water (bird baths and
   garden ponds), and shelter (e.g., brush-piles, outbuildings) resources
   and are surrounded by varying landscape cover. To evaluate which
   residential landscape and yard features influence the richness and
   diversity of mammalian herbivores and mesopredators; we deployed
   wildlife game cameras throughout Northwestern Arkansas, USA in 46
   residential yards in summer 2021 and 96 yards in summer 2022. We found
   that mesopredator diversity had a negative relationship with fences and
   was positively influenced by the number of bird feeders present in a
   yard. Mesopredator richness increased with the amount of forest within
   400 m of the camera. Herbivore diversity and richness were positively
   correlated to the area of forest within 400 m surrounding yard and by
   garden area within yards, respectively. Our results suggest that while
   landscape does play a role in the presence of wildlife in a residential
   area, homeowners also have agency over the richness and diversity of
   mammals using their yards based on the features they create or maintain
   on their properties.},

Abstract = {There is a need for better understanding of urban land systems as cities
   around the world are confronting environmental change. One urban land
   system that has large implications for biophysical systems, but is
   especially difficult to manage are private residential neighborhoods.
   This perspective essay draws together previously disconnected
   scholarship on housing and land systems to define residential land
   tenure: the formal and informal rules, rights, and obligations to
   access, use, and transfer a land parcel by virtue of those assigned to
   the dwelling it contains. The environmental consequences of residential
   land tenure are illustrated using the example of compulsory collective
   governance, a housing tenure arrangement that has become part and parcel
   with single family detached residential subdivisions across the
   Anglosphere. Under this regime, land holders forfeit control in exchange
   for wealth building potential centered on aesthetics. The consequences
   for the environment are largest where statutory law is weak and
   pro-environmental action does not align with aesthetics-driven wealth
   building goals. Broadly, the example illustrates how urban land
   institutions operating primarily in the social realm can also be
   understood as de facto land managers in urban contexts.},

Abstract = {A substantial fraction of the open space in (peri-) urban and rural
   areas is covered by domestic gardens which support the delivery of
   multiple ecosystem services. Although individually they may look
   insignificant, the aggregation of domestic gardens and of gardening
   actions can be significant. Referring to `the tyranny of small
   decisions', we launch the concept of a `resource by small gardening
   actions': the positive cumulative outcome of individual garden owners
   adopting pro-environmental gardening practices. Using qualitative
   research, we gained a thorough insight into the barriers and levers
   related to the development of domestic gardens as a `resource by small
   gardening actions'. By combining the data from expert interviews with a
   design workshop addressing garden and landscape architects, and focus
   groups with private garden owners, we identified eight barriers and nine
   levers. These levers are part of a `mix and match' toolbox, allowing the
   development of tailor-made strategies for garden governance. These
   insights increase the understanding on if and how private actors and
   their properties could become part of policy plans to support ecosystem
   services. This adds to the global understanding of the strategic value
   of daily-life landscapes that exist all over the world. (C) 2015

   of owl vocalisations; avian diversity, relative abundance and community
   composition; small invasive mammal and ground insect activity; and
   invertebrate relative abundance at 26 residential properties over an
   18-month period that coincided with a retrofit from high-pressure sodium
   (HPS) to white light-emitting diode (LED) streetlights. Initiation time
   of dawn song was advanced or delayed for two bird species following the
   retrofit and backyard avian community composition was altered. Avian
   species richness, relative abundances of three bird species and ground
   insect activity increased in the presence of LED streetlights. No other
   retrofit effects were found. Our study suggests that retrofitting
   streetlights with white LEDs may lead to both positive and negative
   conservation outcomes for urban wildlife, but direct impacts are
   relatively small and may be mitigated by changes in lighting
   characteristics, such as dimming. Streetlight retrofits could provide an
   opportunity to reduce the impacts of ALAN on urban wildlife if
   intentionally designed with conservation benefits in mind.},

Abstract = {Animals from urban areas are regularly brought into wildlife
   rehabilitation centers, providing untapped potential data records to
   inform management of wildlife species. Although rescues may be
   considered a wildlife stewardship behavior, not all `rescues' may be
   warranted. Some animals are more likely to be brought into a rescue
   center than others, suggesting that human drivers underlying wildlife
   rehabilitation efforts are important to understand for urban
   conservation efforts. Literature has primarily focused on understanding
   the ecological drivers and implications of wildlife rescues. Our study
   is the first to investigate both the social and ecological drivers of
   bird rescues using census, household survey, and intake data. In Phoenix
   metropolitan area, Arizona, USA in 2017-2018, we found doves and common
   species were sent to the center most often. Altricial species (helpless
   at hatching) and young birds were more likely to be brought to the
   center, perhaps due to perceptions of young animals as vulnerable. We
   found rescues came from neighborhoods with higher incomes and residents
   with pro-ecological worldviews, perhaps reflecting a perceived
   responsibility for wildlife. Conversely, few rescues came from
   neighborhoods with a high percentage of Hispanic/Latinx residents, who
   often feel more interdependent with nature. Neighborhoods with greater
   numbers of rescues were more likely to have residents participating in
   yard stewardship activities as compared to neighborhoods with fewer
   rescues. Our findings are relevant to understanding drivers of wildlife
   stewardship actions and for intake centers who wish to reduce the
   occurrence of people bringing in wildlife that do not need to be
   rescued.},

Abstract = {Understanding public attitudes towards the environment and factors
   influencing it is very important in predicting pro-environmental
   behaviour of citizens. However, in many cities in sub-Saharan Africa,
   where rapid urbanisation has come with diverse environmental
   sustainability challenges, there are very few studies that provide
   insight into the attitude of citizens towards urban green infrastructure
   (UGI) and the factors influencing it. This study investigated residents'
   attitude towards UGI and the factors influencing it in Lagos Metropolis,
   Nigeria. The data were collected through a questionnaire survey of 1560
   participants and physical observations in selected neighbourhoods in the
   study area. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics,
   multiple regression and content analyses. It was observed that the most
   common UGI in the study area were parks, gardens, grasses, sport fields
   and street trees and that around 67\% of the participants demonstrated
   good attitude towards UGI in their respective neighbourhoods. In
   addition, around 47\% of the variance inR(2)was explained by the
   regression model with residents' perceived role of UGI in fostering
   social cohesion and health benefits and quality of neighbourhood UGI
   emerging as the top three factors that influenced residents' attitude
   towards green infrastructure. This study implies that adequate knowledge
   of the social and health benefits and quality of GI are vital to
   developing positive attitudes towards GI among urban population.},

Abstract = {A diversity of indigenous and alien wildlife persists in suburbia, and
   provides residents with the opportunity to experience wildlife. Suburban
   gardens may serve as refugia and foraging grounds for many primate
   species allowing them to populate within a largely urbanized landscape.
   However, this has led to the increasing human interactions with them,
   resulting in conflict. Our study investigated the perceptions of
   suburban residents towards urban vervet monkeys Cercopithecus aethiops
   pygerythrus within the Msunduzi and Ethekwini municipalities,
   KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We assessed how these related to the
   monkeys' presence, activities and interactions in residential gardens,
   and the value of wildlife to residents. Assessment was conducted through
   an online questionnaire survey. General attitudes of residents to vervet
   monkeys were canvassed by assessing the respondents' level of active
   engagement in wildlife watching within their properties. We analyzed 603
   surveys submitted online using logistic regression and ordinal
   regression models. We ascertained that vervet monkeys were disliked by
   29\% of residents due to their aggressiveness, destructive behaviour in
   gardens and households, and perceived threat to native wildlife.
   Frequency and duration of foraging vervet monkeys in residents' gardens
   was influenced by the presence of pet dogs, fruiting trees, tall trees
   (> 2 m), ratio of indigenous to alien vegetation of gardens, residency
   type, and active and passive food provisioning. Despite conflict, the
   majority of respondents appreciated urban wildlife (67\%) and actively
   engaged in wildlife watching (88\%), emphasizing the importance of
   incorporating human dimension values into the management of urban
   biodiversity. Our study highlights the value of citizen science in
   providing mechanisms for identifying priority management and
   conservation efforts at the highly complex human-wildlife interface in
   an urbanized landscape.},

Abstract = {As natural habitats decline and wildlife adapts to increasing
   anthropogenic disturbance, it is crucial to understand humanwildlife
   relationships in residential areas. However, relevant studies are
   limited and mostly focused on single cities. To address this knowledge
   gap, we investigated people's preferences for seeing wild mammals in
   residential areas by conducting and analyzing an online survey
   distributed across Germany (n = 2997 participants). Our results revealed
   that preferred species (squirrels, hedgehogs, hares, roe deer) were
   frequently encountered, whereas unpreferred species were those
   encountered frequently (rats, martens), as well as those encountered
   rarely (wild boar, coypus, raccoons). We also found a moderately
   positive correlation between the number of encounters with mammals and
   them being preferred by humans. Finally, some socio-demographic
   variables, particularly gender, garden access, and urbanity, are
   significantly related to human preferences. Based on our results, we
   propose tailoring wildlife management in residential areas to promote
   the positive attributes of preferred wildlife as biodiversity
   ambassadors, while also addressing ways to mitigate encounters and
   negative perceptions associated with unpreferred species.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The negative impacts of urbanization on biodiversity are well known, and
   the use of native vegetation in private gardens and streetscapes have
   been shown to improve the species richness and abundance of native
   wildlife, thereby improving the biodiversity of the local area. This
   study poses the question of whether the general public is interested in
   planting native species, to determine whether a cultural shift in garden
   planting style is feasible. A total of 3707 questionnaires relating to
   nature in the backyard were delivered to residents in metropolitan
   Melbourne, Australia with 417 responses received (11.2\% response rate).
   The results indicate that the public perception of the aesthetic appeal
   of native gardens is fairly positive and that Melbournians have
   considerable interest in planting native species in residential gardens
   and that a large number would like wildlife in their yards. The paper
   concludes that there is scope to encourage the use of native plants in

Abstract = {Background: Outdoor learning and computer-based learning are two
   different alternatives to in-class conventional teacher-centered
   learning. Purpose: This study compares the outdoor learning setting with
   computer-based learning in class. It examines the influence of the two
   different learning settings on academic achievements, the learning
   experience, and pro-environmental perceptions. Sample: A total of 90
   elementary school students (third and fourth-grade classes) participated
   in the study. Design and methods: The academic knowledge of the study
   participants was tested through identical exams for both learning
   settings. In addition, in each group the students' perceptions were
   examined by means of a questionnaire about environmental values and the
   learning experience. Results: The study demonstrates that academic
   achievements in the two settings were similar, but the students
   expressed more enthusiasm about the outdoor learning experience than
   about in-class learning. In addition, the outdoor learning setting
   contributed more to promoting positive environmental perceptions even
   though students did not learn directly about environmental issues and
   sustainability. Conclusions: These findings suggest that learning in the
   natural environment is valuable: Alongside the fostering of computerized
   learning, it is also important to promoteoutdoor learning settings and
   integrate both settings by implementing mobile technologies in the

Abstract = {Fully understanding patterns of water use and water conservation among
   different consumer groups will help in implementing more effective water
   conservation programs worldwide. Consequently, we investigated water use
   patterns, water conservation practices, attitudes, and hindrances to
   water conservation by randomly surveying 776 households in the Weinan,
   Yanglin-Wugong, and Baoji districts in the middle of the Wei River
   Basin. The results of the study reveal that water consumption for
   domestic use of 70.2 L per capita per day (Lpcd), 31.9 L of which is
   allocated for outdoor use. Households with high water consumption
   consume more water for watering vegetable gardens and cleaning their
   houses and yards, and employ more appliances and apparatuses that use
   water. A total of 20 conservation practices were reported by of which 11
   were used by the majority of residents. Residents prefer to implement
   the most convenient and low-cost water conservation practices. The
   households with low water consumption were likely to conserve water
   because of economic concerns, but their unwillingness to change
   traditional habits prevent them from conserving water. For households
   with high water consumption groups, environmental concerns drive them to
   conserve water, their unwillingness to devote additional time and energy
   and the lack of social support are the main hindrances to water
   conservation. Public education programs on water use and conservation
   for rural communities need to fully consider these limitations to change
   traditional views and behaviors toward the use of water appliances and
   improving quality of life, as well as employing outdoor water
   conservation, pro-environmental education, and price transparency to
   promote the judicious use of water. The results obtained can be used as
   guidelines for establishing policies for community water conservation.

Abstract = {One of the contemporary challenges facing urban areas is the necessity
   to identify novel approaches to resident involvement in solution
   creation, with a particular focus on ensuring the best possible
   nutrition. By investigating the process of co-participation of city
   dwellers in a unique education project, this paper aims to gain a deeper
   understanding of the health-related motivations that underpin the
   decision of early adopters of the implemented technological innovations
   to join the social experiment. The qualitative study employed purposive
   sampling and in-depth interviews conducted in two waves, the first
   between October and November 2022 and the second between September 2023
   and January 2024. The study comprised 42 participants drawn from two
   communities of residents in \& Lstrok;\& oacute;d \& zacute; and Warsaw,
   Poland. Transcriptions of the interviews were carried out using semantic
   field analysis, employing a quantitative approach that counts the
   frequency of keyword occurrences. Three categories of semantic fields
   were identified: associations, oppositions, and actions toward the
   subject, including positive, neutral, and negative temperatures. The
   findings demonstrate that the health concerns of residents are a pivotal
   factor in their decision to participate in urban food self-production
   initiatives, given their limited access to nutritious and healthy
   vegetables. This is related to several factors, including restrictions
   related to urbanization and the displacement of local suppliers,
   lifestyle, and the fast pace of urban life. The dissemination of
   innovative solutions for growing food in urban environments could,
   therefore, facilitate awareness-raising and motivation to alter the

Title = {Does Use of Backyard Resources Explain the Abundance of Urban Wildlife?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {While urbanization is clearly contributing to biodiversity loss, certain
   wildlife assemblages can paradoxically be diverse and abundant in
   moderately developed areas. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is
   that abundant anthropogenic resources for wildlife (i.e., food and
   shelter) outweigh the costs associated with urbanization. To test this
   hypothesis, we used camera traps to measure mammal species richness,
   diversity, and relative abundance (i.e., detection rate) in 58
   residential yards in Raleigh, North Carolina, focusing on six types of
   features that might be used as resources: animal feeding, vegetable
   gardens, compost piles, chicken coops, brushpiles, and water sources. We
   also placed cameras at random control sites within each yard and sampled
   forests in nearby suburban and rural areas for comparison. We fit
   mixed-effects Poisson models to determine whether yard features,
   yard-scale characteristics, or landscape-scale landcover predicted
   mammal relative abundance for eight species. We also tested if the
   relative abundance of native canid predators in yards was related to the
   number of prey (rodents and lagomorphs). Species richness, diversity,
   and relative abundance of most mammal species was higher in yards and
   suburban forests than in rural forests. Within a yard, purposeful
   feeding had the strongest effect on animal relative abundance, with
   eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) being the most common
   (32.3 squirrels/day at feeders; 0.55 at control sites; 0.29 in suburban
   forests; and 0.10 in rural forests). We observed species using (e.g.,
   eating) most yard features, although canids were less likely than other
   taxa to use resources in yards. The presence of a yard feature did not
   strongly affect the abundance of species at the control site in the
   yard, suggesting the influence of these features was highly localized.
   The relative abundance of predators had a positive association with prey
   relative abundance, and predators were less common in yards with fences.
   These results demonstrate that there is high use of anthropogenic
   resources, especially supplemental feeding by urban wildlife, and this
   increase in prey species may then attract predators, which supports the
   hypothesis that use of supplemental food resources explains the
   abundance of urban wildlife.},

Abstract = {Domestic gardens collectively cover substantial areas within cities and
   play an important role in supporting urban biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning. The extent of their contribution to urban biodiversity is
   ultimately determined by the attitudes, motivations, and practices of
   their owners. We identified variables characterizing individual
   householders and their properties that explained variation in perennial
   plant and avian species richness and plant diversity among 55 gardens in
   New Zealand. The size of the vegetated area was most important in
   explaining bird and plant diversity, independent of property size. Also
   important and positively associated with plant richness were
   socio-economic status and ability to discriminate between native and
   exotic species. Median housing age and neighborhood green space were
   less important. Contrary to expectations, better educated householders
   who demonstrated pro-environmental orientation (NEP) did not necessarily
   have gardens with greater plant diversity, however, people with higher
   NEP scores tended to have gardens with more structurally complex
   vegetation. Similar variables were important in explaining native and
   exotic species richness, but higher exotic plant diversity was
   associated with older people with smaller properties of lower value.
   Avian species richness increased primarily with vegetated area, but also
   the areas of beds and hedges. We demonstrate that although householder
   knowledge is an important determinant of garden biodiversity, vegetated
   area is most important. Promoting urban garden biodiversity requires
   that larger vegetated properties be supported and encouraged, and that
   planners should consider biodiversity when formulating policies
   concerning garden size, property size, and consents that may result in a
   progressive increase in the proportion of built over/paved areas.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic emerged as a global public health
   threat. In this crisis period, urban parks provided multiple ecosystem
   services and direct/indirect benefits to mental and physical health.
   However, the use patterns, attitudes, and perceptions of urban park
   visitors remained unexplored in Saudi cities. This study aimed to find
   out the use patterns, attitudes, and perceptions of people regarding
   urban parks during the COVID19 pandemic, and the findings were compared
   with non-pandemic periods. Two urban parks (Al Masarah Garden and Al
   Jamaa Garden) in Jeddah megacity (Saudi Arabia) were assessed, and 215
   respondents were surveyed to fulfil the objectives of the study. The
   study applied a questionnaire survey and field observations to
   understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use patterns,
   attitudes, and perceptions of urban park visitors. Non parametric tests
   (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests) were performed to find out the
   impact of sociodemographic factors (such as age, gender, and education).
   From the results, it was found that the COVID-19 pandemic had a
   substantial impact on the use, attitudes, and perceptions of urban parks
   in comparison with non-pandemic periods. The number of park visitors
   decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but urban parks were crucial to
   people's mental and physical well-being. The findings of this study may
   help to understand the importance of urban parks as green spaces and to
   implement measures to enhance the quality and quantity of urban green
   spaces in Saudi cities.},

Abstract = {This paper reports subjective experiences in nature of 5 children aged
   6-10 years collected during a 5-day camp in a botanical garden. Creative
   expressive visual methods and semi-structured interviews were used to
   collect data. Inductive analysis produced the follow themes: children
   being positioned to take care of nature and to be taken care of by
   nature, as well as nature needing protection from children and children
   needing protection from nature. The roles of gatekeepers in mediating
   attraction to and repulsion from nature were also highlighted. We
   examine these in the context of socio-cultural constraints and
   invitations that children experience in developing these relationships.
   These themes are discussed using a theoretical framework that blends
   Vygotsky's socio-cultural development theory with Gibson's theory of
   affordances. Findings contribute to a more integrated understanding of
   how ecological psychology and social psychology can inform our
   understanding of children's relationships with nature; in particular,
   how children's experiences with nature are mediated by socio-cultural
   factors. By adding to our understanding of how children develop
   relationships with nature, practitioners can more effectively facilitate
   experiences that encourage pro-environmental and stewardship attitudes
   and behaviors as well as result in positive health and development
   outcomes for children. This paper contributes to the children's
   geographies literature by strengthening the theoretical foundation from
   which geographers approach child-nature relationships.},

Abstract = {Many human populations are undergoing an extinction of experience, with
   a progressive decline in interactions with nature. This is a consequence
   both of a loss of opportunity for, and orientation towards, such
   experiences. The trend is of concern in part because interactions with
   nature can be good for human health and wellbeing. One potential means
   of redressing these losses is through the intentional provision of
   resources to increase wildlife populations in close proximity to people,
   thereby increasing the potential for positive human-nature experiences,
   and thence the array of benefits that can result. In this paper, we
   review the evidence that these resource subsidies have such a cascade of
   effects. In some Westernized countries, the scale of provision is
   extraordinarily high, and doubtless leads to both positive and negative
   impacts for wildlife. In turn, these impacts often lead to more
   frequent, reliable and closer human-nature interactions, with a greater
   variety of species. The consequences for human wellbeing remain poorly
   understood, although benefits documented in the context of human-nature
   interactions more broadly seem likely to apply. There are also some
   important feedback loops that need to be better characterized if
   resource provisioning is to contribute effectively towards averting the
   extinction of experience.

   subsidies and host-parasite dynamics in wildlife'.},

Abstract = {Traditional methods of assessing human-animal interactions include

   patterns of human-animal interactions can be assessed. In this study,
   internet search data of human-red fox interactions were analyzed for
   annual and monthly patterns. In general, patterns of internet searches
   were highest during April-August, reflecting key events for foxes such
   as denning and cub rearing. Increased searches for human-fox conflict
   solutions during this same period may also reflect changes in human
   behavior (e.g., increased garden usage). Annual increases in some search
   terms suggested an increasing awareness of foxes and problems with the
   species. This study shows that internet searches can show clear seasonal
   patterns that are associated with important periods of species biology.},

Volume = {20},
Number = {14},
Pages = {3517-3535},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Private property is increasingly important for nature conservation, and
   exurbia an increasingly prominent form of private land use. There have
   been very few studies of the attitudes of exurban landowners to nature,
   all of which indicate a high degree of biophilia, and no studies of the
   effect of variation in the attitudes and actions of these landowners on
   wild mammal assemblages on their properties. A questionnaire survey of
   landowners was combined with spotlight observations of fauna on their
   properties to test the attitudes of the landowners to nature and the
   null hypothesis that syndromes of landowner attitudes to nature, and
   actions in relation to nature, have no effect on wild mammals at the
   property scale. All respondents were positive about native wild animals
   and trees. Four groups of landowners (biophiles, autocrats, idealists
   and utilitarians) derived by a classification of ordination scores based
   on attitude and action question responses, were different in their
   attitudes towards native wild mammals, exotic wild mammals and trees.
   However, their properties did not differ in the presence or frequency of
   any native wild mammal species. There were statistical relationships
   between the presence/absence of native wild animal species and indices
   related to intervention, fondness of trees, aversion to trees, fondness
   of native animals, and fondness of exotic animals. However, with the
   possible exception of the tendency of the common brushtail possum
   (Trichosurus vulpecula) to be absent from properties owned by the people
   who least liked wild animals, the association of native animals with
   attitude or action indices appeared to be coincidental. It therefore
   seems that programs directed towards influencing the attitudes of
   landowners to wildlife may be ineffective in conserving wildlife in
   exurbia.},

Abstract = {Several organizations run wildlife-gardening programs designed to

   whether common wildlife-gardening recommendations correlate with

   presence of hummingbird feeders in a patch, (2) number of

   nectar-provisioning flowering-plants in a patch were endemic to the
   conterminous USA, and (4) lack of impervious surface (a common proxy for

   previous studies that showed how recommendations from wildlife-gardening
   programs associate with intended outcomes, but do so across an
   exceptionally broad, national extent that varies enormously in physical

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Achieving conservation outcomes requires concerted engagement from many
   people across diverse societies. However, many conservation
   practitioners struggle to engage new audiences. Research suggests one
   effective strategy to reach nonengaged individuals is to encourage
   interested conservation actors to share information, provide resources
   and assistance, and organize local events to recruit others; we call
   these ``diffusion behaviors.{''} Previous studies suggest few
   conservation actors who engage in personal-sphere PEB also engage in
   diffusion PEB, potentially because these behaviors have unique barriers
   which have yet to be identified. We investigated if there are different
   psychosocial drivers of diffusion and personal-sphere PEB by surveying
   residents in Colorado, USA about their personal-sphere wildscape
   behaviors (e.g. planting native plants) and diffusion wildscape
   behaviors (e.g. helping a friend plant native plants). Including
   diffusion-specific psychosocial variables led to better predictions of
   both personal-sphere and diffusion PEB. Diffusion-specific
   self-efficacy, social and environmental response efficacy, and
   reputational concerns about perceived competence were significant
   predictors of diffusion behavior. Diffusion-specific environmental
   response efficacy and injunctive norms enforced through sanctioning
   significantly predicted personal-sphere behavior. Personal-sphere
   self-efficacy and dynamic norm beliefs predicted both behavior types.
   Our findings suggest that research should consider personal-sphere and
   diffusion PEB as distinct domains and should investigate the power of
   diffusion-specific perceptions. Conservation outreach programs seeking
   to encourage diffusion of PEB may benefit from designing programming to
   try to change these perceptions.},

Title = {An underrated habitat: Residential gardens support similar mammal
   assemblages to urban remnant vegetation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {250},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urban environments offer substantial opportunities for wildlife
   conservation as they commonly overlap the distribution of native species
   and comprise structurally complex and diverse habitats. Conservation
   strategies within urban environments currently focus on enhancing or
   maintaining natural remnant vegetation despite the variety of smaller
   greenspaces that are known to support wildlife. Residential gardens in
   particular comprise a major component of the total greenspace in urban
   areas and offer numerous resources that can be used by multiple taxa,
   and may therefore represent an important, yet unrealised opportunity for
   conservation. In this study we aimed to further the understanding of the
   potential value of gardens for biodiversity conservation by comparing
   the diversity, presence, abundance and reproductive activity of mammals
   in gardens to natural urban bushland remnants. We demonstrate that
   gardens support a similar diversity of native mammals as urban bushland
   and that the presence, abundance and reproductive activity for most
   native mammals was similar in both bushland and gardens. With the
   exception of domestic pets, the presence and abundance of introduced
   species was not higher in gardens compared to urban bushland. Our study
   highlights that the potential role of residential gardens for
   biodiversity conservation should not be overlooked. Given that novel
   urban ecosystems will continue to expand, inclusion of gardens in
   wildlife conservation and management actions is likely to greatly
   increase our ability to conserve wildlife in urban habitats.},

Title = {Biodiversity conservation in urban gardens - Pets and garden design
   influence activity of a vulnerable digging mammal},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Residential gardens can provide essential opportunities for native
   wildlife and represent a valuable way of creating new habitats.
   Bandicoots (marsupial family Peramelidae) are medium-sized digging
   mammals that play a valuable role in maintaining ecosystem health;
   retaining these important ecosystem engineers across urban landscapes,
   including in private gardens, can have enormous conservation benefits.
   Urbanisation is a significant threat for some bandicoot species, and
   therefore understanding the factors associated with their activity can
   help guide urban landscape and garden design. To identify key features
   associated with the activity of a local endemic bandicoot species, the
   quenda (Isoodon fusciventer), we carried out a camera trap survey of
   front and back yards for 65 residential properties in the City of
   Mandurah, Western Australia. We compared quenda activity with biotic and
   abiotic factors that could indicate potential predation risk (activity
   of domestic dogs Canis familiaris and cats Felis catus, and the presence
   of artificial or natural protective cover), food availability (including
   deliberate or inadvertent supplementary feeding, provision of water, and
   diggable surfaces) and garden acces-sibility (distance to bushland,
   permeability of boundary fencing, and garden position). Supplementary
   feeding was strongly associated with quenda activity. Quenda were also
   more active in back yards, and in gardens where there was greater
   vegetation cover. Of concern, quenda activity was positively associated
   with cat activity, which could reflect that straying pet cats are
   attracted to gardens that harbour wildlife populations, including
   quenda. Furthermore, almost half of the gardens showed cat activity
   despite only a small sample of the surveyed residents owning a pet cat.
   Results of this study can help guide the design of residential gardens
   to increase useful habitat for these important digging mammals.
   Vegetation, wood mulch and semi-permeable fencing can provide valu-able
   resources needed to support the persistence of quendas across the
   rapidly changing urban landscape mosaic, where natural and managed
   (e.g., gardens and parks) green spaces are becoming less common and more
   isolated.},

Volume = {196},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Interactions with nature can improve the wellbeing of urban residents
   and increase their interest in biodiversity. Many places within cities
   offer opportunities for people to interact with wildlife, including open
   space and residential yards and gardens, but little is known about which
   places within a city people use to observe wildlife. In this study, we
   used publicly available spatial data on people's observations of birds
   from three online platforms-eBird, iNaturalist, and Flickr-to determine
   where people observe birds within the city of Chicago, Illinois (USA).
   Specifically, we investigated whether land use or neighborhood
   demographics explained where people observe birds. We expected that more
   observations would occur in open spaces, and especially conservation
   areas, than land uses where people tend to spend more time, but
   biodiversity is often lower (e.g., residential land). We also expected
   that more populated neighborhoods and those with higher median age and
   income of residents would have more bird observations recorded online.
   We found that bird observations occurred more often in open spaces than
   in residential areas, with high proportions of observations in
   recreation areas. In addition, a linear regression model showed that
   neighborhoods with higher median incomes, those with larger populations,
   and those located closer to Lake Michigan had more bird observations
   recorded online. These results have implications for conservation and
   environmental education efforts in Chicago and demonstrate the potential
   for social media and citizen science data to provide insight into urban

Title = {Public perception towards river and water conservation practices:
   Opportunities for implementing urban stormwater management practices},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {223},
Pages = {478-488},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The effectiveness of urban stormwater management practices (SMPs) on
   local water quality is dependent on adoption rates reaching a critical
   mass. While numerous studies have measured the effectiveness of
   practices on controlling water quantity and improving water quality, few
   have focused on the perspective of the public. The purpose of this study
   was to identify individuals' perceptions of urban SMPs implementation in
   the public and private realms, and how longitudinal perceptions about
   the local river could inform future water resource management. Through
   the lens of environmental behavior theories, we performed statistical
   analyses on four surveys - 2006, 2009, 2014 and 2016 - administered to
   urban residents in the Wabash River watershed in Tippecanoe County,
   Indiana. Our findings show that residents' water quality awareness and
   sense of personal responsibility increase over the ten years studied. In
   particular, rain garden adopters have higher appreciation of the Wabash
   River and care about how the river functions than other SMP adopters and
   non-adopters. In terms of urban SMP adoption, results indicate that
   residents are supportive of integrating rain barrels and rain gardens
   into public spaces. Perceptions of SMP benefits related to functional
   benefits, rather than environmental benefits, are prevalent when
   considering implementing SMPs on personal property. In addition,
   respondents support reducing stormwater charges for adopters of such
   practices on private property. Although cognitive barriers exist in
   those who have yet to adopt the practices, including concerns about SMP
   effectiveness, maintenance, aesthetics, and risk of bugs and insects,
   adopters are less likely to perceive such barriers. This research
   suggests that making resources (i.e., skills, knowledge, equipment,
   funding) more accessible to the public is essential, but not sufficient
   to encourage pro-environmental behaviors. Promoting public involvement
   in watershed activities, increasing their awareness about how urban SMPs
   function, and emphasizing the functional benefits of practices can be
   effective in motivating adoption.},

Abstract = {Urbanization along the eastern seaboard of Australia has increased the
   potential for conflict between humans and wildlife. The northern suburbs
   of Sydney are home to the southern brown (Isoodon obesulus) and the
   long-nosed bandicoot (Perameles nasuta). Both are known to enter yards

   the public's perception of bandicoots will enable wildlife managers to
   develop effective and socially acceptable conservation strategies. Six
   hundred and thirty questionnaires were distributed to the residents
   bordering Ku-ring-gai Chase and Garigal National Park in Sydney,
   Australia, to assess the sources of conflict. Eighty-three percent of
   respondents had experienced bandicoot interactions and 27\% had
   experienced interactions on a daily basis. This interaction with
   bandicoots influenced respondents' perception of a bandicoot as a
   nuisance or pest. The age of the resident and pet ownership status also
   influenced respondents' attitudes. Contrary to anecdotal reports, there
   was an overall positive response from the community. The information
   gained from this survey will inform the development community-based

Abstract = {The expansion of coyotes (Canis latrans) into the northeastern United
   States is a major challenge to wildlife professionals, especially in
   suburban and urban areas where reports of human coyote interaction (HCI)
   are on the rise. To assist wildlife professionals in identifying
   potential hot spots of interaction and homeowners in evaluating their
   risk of a backyard encounter, we used the techniques of citizen science
   to build a landscape model of HCI for suburban residential properties in
   Westchester County, New York, USA. We distributed surveys via school
   children (kindergarten to grade 12) as part of a voluntary class
   assignment, to maximize the number of homeowners participating in our
   study and to provide learning experiences for students. Of 6,000 surveys
   distributed to schools, >1,500 students interviewed their parents on
   whether a coyote had been seen or heard on their property from 2003 to
   2006. Although surveys could not be distributed randomly owing to the
   participatory process of individual schools, we did receive responses
   from across Westchester County, representing the spectrum from the most
   rural to the most urban towns. Homeowners who encountered (i.e., seen or
   heard) a coyote on their property were on average 50\% closer to forest,
   36\% closer to grassland, and 66\% farther from medium- to
   high-intensity development, complementing existing knowledge on urban
   coyote habitat use. Our model seemed robust in predicting an independent
   set of coyote observations (r = 0.88). Based on this model, we generated
   a map describing the probability of HCI that can be used by both
   wildlife professionals and homeowners. Regarding the former, state
   wildlife agencies could more precisely target education campaigns on how
   to live with coyotes where the possibility of HCI was greatest.
   Homeowners, in turn, could evaluate their own risk and modify behaviors
   that would make their property less attractive to coyotes. Furthermore,
   in creating a descriptive model of HCI from citizen-generated data, we
   demonstrated how citizen science can be a useful exploratory tool,
   generating a wealth of data over a large geographic area in a short
   period, especially when the inquest is appropriate to stakeholder
   participation in data collection.},

Title = {Contrasting effects of visiting urban green-space and the countryside on
   biodiversity knowledge and conservation support},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Conservation policy frequently assumes that increasing people's exposure
   to green-space enhances their knowledge of the natural world and desire
   to protect it. Urban development is, however, considered to be driving
   declining connectedness to nature. Despite this the evidence base
   supporting the assumption that visiting green-spaces promotes
   biodiversity knowledge and conservation support, and the impacts of
   urbanization on these relationships, is surprisingly limited. Using data
   from door-to-door surveys of nearly 300 residents in three pairs of
   small and large urban areas in England we demonstrate that people who
   visit green-space more regularly have higher biodiversity knowledge and
   support for conservation (measured using scales of pro-environmental
   behavior). Crucially these relationships only arise when considering
   visits to the countryside and not the frequency of visits to urban
   green-space. These patterns are robust to a suite of confounding
   variables including nature orientated motivations for visiting
   green-space, socio-economic and demographic factors, garden-use and
   engagement with natural history programs. Despite this the correlations
   that we uncover cannot unambiguously demonstrate that visiting the
   countryside improves biodiversity knowledge and conservation support. We
   consider it likely, however, that two mechanisms operate through a
   positive feedback loop i.e. increased visits to green-space promote an
   interest in and knowledge of biodiversity and support for conservation,
   which in turn further increase the desire to visit green-space and
   experience nature. The intensity of urbanization around peoples' homes,
   but not city size, is negatively associated with their frequency of
   countryside visits and biodiversity knowledge. Designing less intensely
   urbanized cities with good access to the countryside, combined with
   conservation policies that promote access to the countryside thus seems
   likely to maximize urban residents' biodiversity knowledge and support
   for conservation.},

Title = {Landscaping preferences influence neighborhood satisfaction and yard
   management decisions},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {59},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Residential landscapes support human well-being and ecological
   functioning in urban ecosystems. Trees and native plants in yards and
   neighborhoods positively influence satisfaction, an important component
   of human well-being and quality of life. However, these patterns may not
   hold true in arid ecoregions, where the composition of desert vegetation
   contrasts the tall, broad-leafed trees of temperate regions. The effects
   of xeric, desert-like landscaping on satisfaction with the neighborhood
   environment are especially important to consider given the large amount
   of resources required to support people's propensity for grassy yards.
   Although place satisfaction is related to pro-environmental behavior,
   the multi-scalar relationship between yard management decisions and
   satisfaction with the neighborhood environment has yet to be
   established. Here, we test the social-ecological dynamics of landscape
   preferences, satisfaction with trees and desert plants, and management
   intensity in residential yards and neighborhoods throughout the desert
   city of Phoenix, Arizona, USA. We found that wealthy neighborhoods close
   to desert open space were intensively managed and supported the highest
   levels of satisfaction. However, there was no direct relationship
   between satisfaction and management intensity for people who preferred
   xeric landscaping. Instead, management intensity for people with xeric
   preferences was related to demographics, such as income and home
   ownership. There was a relationship between satisfaction and management
   intensity for people with mesic preferences, suggesting a resource cost
   to maintain satisfaction for lush, green landscaping in a desert city.
   Overall, our study supports the assertion that changing yard landscaping
   may not result in desired changes for high-input management practices.},

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1389-1403},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Human-wildlife conflict is increasing as urbanization expands and
   wildlife species adjust to living near people. Translocation is often
   used to manage human-wildlife conflict because it is considered to be
   humane, yet fates of translocated animals are largely unknown. As an
   urban adapter, woodchucks (Marmota monax) are a common source of
   human-wildlife conflict due to their burrowing, foraging, and
   scent-marking behavior. We examined survival and movements of 27
   nuisance woodchucks captured by a nuisance wildlife operator in the
   Chicago metropolitan area, radiomarked with internal transmitters, and
   translocated to exurban release sites mimicking typical practices. We
   also captured and radiomarked 16 resident woodchucks from the release
   landscape for comparison. Translocated woodchucks moved farther than
   residents immediately post release with no evidence of homing and most
   left the release site. Annual survival did not differ between
   translocated and resident woodchucks. However, survival was extremely
   low (0.18) compared to previous estimates for woodchucks, primarily due
   to high predation by coyotes (Canis latrans). Translocation should be
   used only when other nonlethal methods are ineffective (e.g., exclusion,
   removing food sources, selecting unpalatable plants for gardens). When
   necessary, the practice of translocation could be improved by reducing
   predation risk for translocated animals, either by selecting release
   sites with low predation risk, or by using soft-release methods, such as
   acclimation enclosures or artificial burrows.},

Title = {Testing the Likeable, Therefore Abundant Hypothesis: Bird Species
   Likeability by Urban Residents Varies Significantly with Species Traits},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The urbanization of landscapes filters bird communities to favor
   particular species traits, driven in part by the changes that homeowners
   make to the amount and quality of habitat in yards. We suggest that an
   ultimate driver of these proximate mechanisms underlying bird community
   change with respect to urbanization is the likeability of species traits
   by urban residents. We hypothesize that bird species likeability,
   modulated by species traits, influences the degree to which homeowners
   alter the availability and quality of habitat on their properties and
   thereby affects species population sizes in urbanized landscapes. We
   refer to this new hypothesis as the Likeable, therefore Abundant
   Hypothesis. The Likeable, therefore Abundant Hypothesis predicts that
   (1) bird species likeability varies with species morphological and
   behavioral traits, (2) homeowners use trait-based likeability as a
   motivator to modify habitat availability and quality on their
   properties, and (3) residential habitat availability and quality
   influences species populations at landscape scales. We tested the first
   prediction of the Likeable, therefore Abundant Hypothesis using a survey
   of 298 undergraduate students at the University of North Carolina at
   Charlotte who were asked to rank their preferences for 85 forest
   generalist and edge/open country songbird species grouped according to
   10 morphological and behavioral traits. Survey respondents preferred
   very small, primarily blue or black species that are insectivorous,
   aerial or bark foragers, residents, and culturally unimportant. On the
   other hand, respondents disliked large or very large, primarily yellow
   or orange species that forage on the ground and/or forage by
   flycatching, are migratory, and are culturally important. If the
   Likeable, therefore Abundant Hypothesis is true, natural resource
   managers and planners could capitalize on the high likeability of
   species that are nevertheless negatively affected by urbanization to
   convince homeowners and residents to actively manage their properties
   for species conservation.},

Title = {Using social network methodological approach to better understand
   human-wildlife interactions},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {99},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Human-wildlife interactions (HWI) are present in areas where wild
   animals and humans compete for limited space, sometimes resulting in
   potentially harmful conflicts on both sides. The upper Prahova Valley
   within the central Carpathian range of Romania represents an area where
   interactions between humans and wildlife can still be found, but
   potentially conflicting due to the presence of both large intact natural
   habitats and increasing human pressure over the environment. In our
   study, we hypothesize that an adequate understanding of the HWI problem
   involves analyses on landscape pattern, natural or human induced
   triggering factors, and local stakeholders' perception of the phenomenon
   including the measures they consider suitable for optimizing their
   interactions with wild animals. Therefore, the goal of our paper was to
   analyse the characteristics of the HWI phenomenon in the upper Prahova
   Valley, based on exploring the local stakeholders' perspective. The
   study methodology consists of three steps: (i) applying 450
   questionnaires to local stakeholders in order to extract HWI data; (ii)
   detecting the interconnection between various types of HWI and the
   perception of local people, using statistical and network approaches;
   and (iii) develop a set of recommendations which are applicable at both,
   local and regional decisional level in order to decrease the negative
   impact of HWI, enhance wildlife conservation strategies and promote a
   sustainable interactions with humans and mitigate potential conflicts
   that occur between humans and wildlife. The results indicate that the
   brown bear, wild boar and red fox were constantly increasing in HWI
   after 1990, while interactions with Eurasian wolf, stone marten,
   European polecat, roe deer and mountain viper were usually scarcer. The
   brown bear and wild boar were the prior species involved in conflict
   interactions with humans, such as the destruction of fences, orchards,
   or gardens. The bear was the only wildlife responsible for non-fatal
   human attacks. Locals consider the lack of wildlife food supply by the
   forest staff and the deficient forest management practices after 1990 to
   be the main triggering factors of these negative HWI. They perceive that
   the interactions with these animals pose a high risk to human security.
   Our results stand as a strong argument for a complex management system
   concerning the HWI phenomenon which adapts upper-level policies and
   governance decisions to both local stakeholder's needs and wildlife
   management objectives to be achieved in order to attain a favorable
   conservation status.},

Title = {Homeowner Associations as a Vehicle for Promoting Native Urban
   Biodiversity},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The loss of habitat due to suburban and urban development represents one
   of the greatest threats to biodiversity. Conservation developments have
   emerged as a key player for reconciling new ex-urban residential
   development with ecosystem services. However, as more than half of the
   world population lives in urban and suburban developments, identifying
   conservation partners to facilitate retrofitting existing residential
   neighborhoods becomes paramount. Homeowner associations (HOA) manage a
   significant proportion of residential developments in the United States,
   which includes the landscape design for yards and gardens. These areas
   have the potential to mitigate the loss of urban biodiversity when they
   provide habitat for native wildlife. Therefore, the conditions and
   restrictions imposed upon the homeowner by the HOA could have profound
   effects on the local wildlife habitat. We explored the potential of HOAs
   to promote conservation by synthesizing research from three monitoring
   programs from Phoenix, Arizona. We compared native bird diversity,
   arthropod diversity, and plant diversity between neighborhoods with and
   without a HOA. Neighborhoods belonging to HOAs had significantly greater
   bird and plant diversity, although insect diversity did not differ. The
   institutional framework structuring HOAs, including sanctions for
   enforcement coupled with a predictable maintenance regime that
   introduces regular disturbance, might explain why neighborhoods with a
   HOA had greater bird diversity. For neighborhoods with a HOA, we
   analyzed landscape form and management practices. We linked these
   features with ecological function and suggested how to modify management
   practices by adopting strategies from the Sustainable Sites Initiative,
   an international sustainable landscaping program, to help support
   biodiversity in current and future residential landscapes.},

Abstract = {Private domestic gardens contribute substantially to the biodiversity of
   urban areas and benefit human health and well-being. We previously
   reported a study of 267 gardens across five cities in the United Kingdom
   in which variation in geographical and climatic factors had little
   bearing on the richness, diversity and composition of plant species. We
   therefore hypothesise that garden management is an important factor in
   determining garden characteristics. Here, from the same sample of
   gardens, we investigate potential associations between the uses to which
   people put their gardens, the types of management activities they
   undertake, and the characteristics of those gardens. Householders (n =
   265) completed a questionnaire detailing various aspects of garden use
   and management activities. The majority of respondents used their
   gardens chiefly for relaxation, recreation, and eating. Fewer than one
   fifth included ``gardening{''} amongst their garden uses even though all
   performed some garden management, suggesting that not all management
   activity resulted from an interest in gardening. Garden-watering and
   lawn-mowing were the most prevalent activities and were predictors of
   other types of management including weeding, vegetation-cutting,
   leaf-collection, and dead-heading flowers. A number of these activities
   were associated with one another, the richness and composition of plant
   species, and the number of land uses in gardens. However, relationships
   between management activities and the amount of tall vegetation were
   less consistent, and garden management appeared to be independent of
   garden area. More species of amphibians, birds, and mammals were
   observed in gardens with ponds and in which efforts were made to attract
   wildlife, particularly by providing drinking water. This study supports
   the hypothesis that garden use and management is associated with garden
   characteristics.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {292},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Despite growing interest in promoting urban biodiversity conservation,
   there are few concrete examples of how nature stewardship initiatives
   can be rapidly scaled, in number and across landscapes. This paper
   explores the factors that promote or inhibit the proliferation and
   impact of collaborations between citizens and their local governments
   that involve residents in municipal biodiversity conservation efforts in
   their gardens (wildlife gardening). We studied the Gardens for Wildlife
   Victoria network in Australia, which supports citizen-agency
   codevelopment of municipal wildlife gardening programs. In three years
   the network has expanded from one program to 39 initiatives in various
   developmental stages in 49\% of the local government areas in the state
   of Victoria. Data are drawn from 21 semi-structured interviews of
   network participants running or developing programs in 12
   municipalities, complemented by a survey of 33 network participants, and
   participants' evaluation of network workshops. We find that scaling
   occurs in four different domains of policy, values, locales and
   participants. Scaling is influenced by six interlinked factors:
   empowerment of actors; a civil-agency co-design and delivery model;
   conservation framing; links to and between landscapes and communities;
   resources - particularly time; and the network's role in promoting
   innovation and shared learning. Key barriers include short-term,
   topdown, and monetary agency foci; conservation framed as the principal
   domain of specialists and professionals; and prioritisation of listed
   species rather than local species more broadly. We present a framework
   for considering scaling of biodiversity stewardship and related factors.},

Title = {Amenity migrants, animals and ambivalent natures: More-than-human
   encounters at home in the rural residential estate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {262-272},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In light of increased development pressure in rural landscapes,
   understanding how amenity migrants understand and experience nature is a
   vital project for rural studies. This paper investigates how residents
   living in a rural residential estate (RRE) negotiate more-than-human
   encounters in domestic settings. RREs are emergent forms of
   master-planned residential development on the rural urban fringe,
   marketed and designed to meet an idyllic rural lifestyle. In the RRE,
   domestic nonhuman transgressions are both presumed as a part of the
   amenity migrant experience, and pre-empted by estate design and
   regulation. Border encounters in gardens were explored via
   semi-structured walking interviews with 27 residents of an RRE, located
   on the rural urban fringe of Sydney, Australia. Nonhuman transgressions
   were found to both contribute towards, and challenge, homemaking
   practices. Some residents expressed a vernacular ecology at home
   entangled with more-than-human company, where nonhumans are
   `neighbours'. Gardens were shared, and maintenance practices altered.
   When domestic expectations of cleanliness and order were challenged,
   native nonhumans were negotiated in gardens with a `hoped-for absence'
   (Ginn, 2014). These stories illustrate that a native politics of
   belonging foreshadows the homemaking practices of amenity migrants. The
   paper suggests settlements similar to RRE can be a positive intervention
   on the rural urban fringe, encouraging different registers of
   interaction with nonhuman nature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Human dimensions research can help resource and wildlife managers make
   informed decisions, target information efforts, and gain a greater
   understanding of the factors that comprise attitudes toward wildlife
   management efforts. Despite these often-stated merits, studies
   addressing the human dimensions of resource and wildlife management
   efforts are rare in Europe. A proposed restoration of free-ranging
   European bison (Bison bonasus) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, has
   presented an opportunity to help address this research gap. During May
   to July 2006, we used a randomly distributed, self-administered
   questionnaire (n = 398) to assess local residents' attitudes, beliefs,
   and levels of support or opposition toward the proposed restoration.
   These factors were compared across two administrative regions spanned by
   the proposed restoration area. We found that respondents from the
   Siegen-Wittgenstein region held significantly more positive attitudes
   and significantly higher knowledge levels than respondents from the
   Hochsauerlandkreis region. Principal components analysis revealed that
   attitudes comprised a general attitude factor pertaining to issues such
   as the importance of conserving bison for future generations and a
   lifestyle impact factor, which included items pertaining to bison-caused
   damages to trees and crops. Logistic regression was used to show the
   influence of fear of bison on attitudes. We discuss the likely causes
   and management implications of our findings and provide suggestions to
   managers wishing to target information efforts and address the concerns
   of those affected by the proposed restoration.},

Title = {Achieving positive social outcomes through participatory urban wildlife
   conservation projects},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Pages = {607-617},
Abstract = {Context As urbanisation continues to increase on a global scale, people
   are becoming increasingly distanced from nature. Fewer opportunities to
   encounter nature mean that the benefits of engaging with nature are
   often not realised by urban residents. In response to this, there is a
   growing number of initiatives that aim to connect people with nature,
   for the benefit of individuals, communities and nature conservation.
   However, in order to maximise these benefits, it is important to
   understand the potential transformative effects for participants, both
   on a personal level and in terms of wider impacts.
   Aims In this study, we evaluate the social outcomes of a participatory
   wildlife conservation project in an urban area in north-east England,
   using hedgehogs as the focal species.
   Methods Based on an approach of community volunteers working alongside
   scientific researchers in an evaluation of hedgehog urban habitat use,
   we examine the transformative effects of this involvement at the
   individual and community levels via qualitative semi-structured
   interviews with community volunteers.
   Key results Participants were motivated by personal wellbeing factors
   such as enjoying proximity to the study species, learning and social
   factors. Participation in the study itself indicates a degree of
   motivation for engaging with a study of this sort. Nevertheless,
   involvement in the study was a successful vehicle for increasing
   participants' engagement with nature both during the study and
   potentially into the future, particularly in terms of biological
   recording and gardening for wildlife.
   Conclusions Participation in a wildlife study is a positive experience
   for many volunteers, leading to actual and potential changes in both
   personal and wider social outcomes.
   Implications Participatory initiatives such as the one described have an
   important role to play in signposting and supporting volunteers to
   follow future environmental aspirations and maximise the personal and
   social benefits associated with participation. This could be enhanced by
   ensuring that volunteering opportunities are linked in with pre-existing
   community-based networks that can act as advocates for environmental and
   wildlife conservation.},

   might differ, depending on the region, specific management practices,
   the yard's size, and the yard's location along the urban to rural

   Gran Sabana, Venezuela: facing changes},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {Background. Human encroachment and overexploitation of natural resources
   in the Neotropics is constantly increasing. Indigenous communities all
   across the Amazon, are trapped between a population rise and a hot
   debate about the sustainability of hunting rates. The Garden Hunting
   hypothesis states that shifting cultivation schemes (conucos) used by
   Amazon indigenous communities may generate favorable conditions,
   increasing abundance of small and medium wildlife species close to the
   `gardens' providing game for indigenous hunters.
   Methods. Here, we combined camera trap surveys and spatially explicit
   interview dataset on Pemon indigenous hunting scope and occurrence in a
   mosaic of savanna and forest in the Gran Sabana, Venezuela to evaluate
   to what extent the wildlife resource use corresponds to Garden Hunting
   hypothesis. We applied the Royle-Nichols model and binomial regression
   in order to: (1) assess whether abundance of small and medium wildlife
   species is higher close to conucos and (2) evaluate whether hunters
   select hunting localities based on accessibility to wildlife resources
   (closeness to conuco) more than wildlife abundance.
   Results. We find mixed evidence supporting the Garden Hunting hypothesis
   predictions. Abundance of small and medium species was high close to
   conucos but the pattern was not statistically significant for most of
   them. Perkin seem to hunt in locations dominated by forest, where
   species abundance was predicted to be higher, than in close vicinity to
   conucos. Hunting scope was focused on the most abundant species located
   close to the conuco (Cuniculus paca), but also in less abundant and
   unavailable species (Crax alector, Tapirus terrestris and Odocoileus
   virginianus).
   Conclusions. Our research provided the first attempt of a systematic
   sampling survey in the Gran Sabana, generating a quantitative dataset
   that not only describes the current pattern of wildlife abundance, but
   sets the base-line to monitor temporal and spatial change in this region
   of highland Amazon. We discuss the applicability of the estimates
   generated as a baseline as well as, environmental challenges imposed by
   economic, social and cultural changes such as mining encroachment for
   wildlife management.},

Abstract = {Natural areas in cities are important refugia for wildlife, but some
   species also use developed areas. Such adaptation may be facilitated at
   the ecotone between natural and residential areas where wildlife
   encounter anthropogenic resources. We quantified human activities and
   objects that potentially attract coyotes (Canis latrans) by providing
   shelter, food, prey habitat, and novelty items where backyards back onto
   natural areas in Edmonton, Canada. We related attractant abundance and
   human demographic variables to coyote access to backyards, scat
   abundance, and the number and nature of reports detailing interactions
   with coyotes near the ecotone. Among 468 surveyed backyards, 31\% were
   accessed by coyotes, and we detected 2055 instances of attractants.
   Coyotes selectively accessed unfenced backyards with food and novelty
   items, and backyard access was most common along transects where fences
   were infrequent, and shelter was abundant. Evidence of deer on transects
   was weakly correlated with increased prevalence of scats. Public reports
   describing conflict with coyotes were more frequent in areas with more
   coyote access to backyards, fewer fences, and more shelter. Weak
   evidence indicated that food abundance, scat prevalence, and backyard
   access were higher in areas with larger houses and more
   university-educated and retired residents. These results suggest that
   coyotes frequently access attractants at the ecotone between natural and
   residential areas, which may promote habituation, food conditioning, and
   human-wildlife conflict. These effects could be reduced, and coexistence
   could be promoted with clearer boundaries separating natural and
   residential areas, opposing conventional recommendations for reserve
   design that encourage gradual transition zones.},

Title = {Managing gardens for wildlife: Features that predict mammal presence and
   abundance in gardens vary seasonally},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Residential gardens in urban areas offer substantial opportunities for
   biodiversity conservation. To realize this opportunity, a comprehensive
   understanding of which species prosper in gardens, which mechanisms
   promote their use of these green spaces and how these mechanisms can be
   manipulated by residents to achieve conservation outcomes, is needed.
   While substantial progress has been made in evaluating the mechanisms
   that influence the diversity, presence, and abundance of wildlife in
   gardens, how these mechanisms vary seasonally is largely unknown. This
   study investigated whether the garden features influencing the presence
   and/or abundance of arboreal, flying, and ground-dwelling mammals in
   gardens varied seasonally using acoustic, trapping, and spotlighting
   surveys undertaken in four consecutive seasons (2018/19) in 52 gardens
   in southwestern Australia. As animal behavior and resource availability
   varies seasonally, we predicted that garden features influencing the
   presence and abundance of mammals in gardens would also vary seasonally.
   For arboreal and ground-dwelling mammals, we found that some garden
   features (e.g., canopy cover and presence of dogs, respectively) were
   important in more than one season; however, none were important in all
   seasons with most only being influential in one. No garden features
   predicted the presence of flying mammals in more than one season. Our
   results suggest that sampling in a single or few seasons may fail to
   identify features influencing wildlife at times other than in the season
   of sampling, or alternatively, may overemphasize factors that do not
   operate across all seasons. Studies that consider the mechanisms on a
   seasonal basis will provide a more comprehensive list of features
   influencing the presence and abundance of animals in gardens. We suggest
   it is both those features that support wildlife in multiple or all
   seasons, and those that support critical life-history events in a single
   season that could contribute to conservation if manipulated by residents
   appropriately.},

Abstract = {Australia's urban landscapes offer opportunities to marry socio-economic
   and biodiversity conservation objectives. Yet, information is needed on
   what urban landscape and habitat features are important for wildlife. In
   this article, we draw together our research from southeastern Australia
   to describe key lessons for biodiversity-sensitive cities and towns.
   Lesson 1: The effects of urbanization on wildlife extend into adjacent
   habitats. We recommend retaining large, undisturbed areas of habitat
   away from development, avoiding intensive development adjacent to
   important conservation areas, prioritizing areas of ecological and
   social significance, screening light and noise pollution at the urban
   fringe and around large nature reserves, and planting appropriately
   provenanced locally native species for public streetscapes, parks and
   gardens. Lesson 2: Strategic enhancement of urban greenspace offers
   biodiversity gains. We recommend increasing the total amount of
   greenspace cover, maintaining ecological structures as habitat islands,
   using landscaping techniques to minimize risks to human safety, and
   gardening with low-flowering native shrubs. Lesson 3: Large old trees
   need to be managed for long-term sustainability. We recommend retaining
   large old trees in new developments, increasing the maximum standing
   life of urban trees, protecting regenerating areas and planting more
   seedlings, supplementing habitat features associated with large trees,
   and ensuring that young trees have space to grow through time. Lesson 4:
   Education and engagement connects residents with nature and raises
   awareness. We recommend education programs to enhance opportunities for
   residents to experience and learn about biodiversity, engaging residents
   in the establishment and maintenance of wildlife habitat, providing
   `cues to care', facilitating access to garden plants that benefit
   wildlife, and encouraging cat containment. These lessons provide an
   evidence-base for implementing conservation and management actions to
   improve the capacity of our cities and towns to support a diverse and
   abundant biota.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is recognized as one of the greatest threats to
   biodiversity throughout the world. However, the vegetation within an
   urbanized landscape is diverse and includes a variety of native and
   exotic plant species. This variation allows for testing whether certain
   landscape designs outperform others in the support of native
   biodiversity. Residential yards represent a large component of an urban
   landscape and, if managed collectively for birds and other wildlife,
   could offset some of the negative effects of urbanization. In addition,
   many urbanites have their primary interaction with the natural world in
   their front and back yards. Therefore, ensuring positive wildlife
   experiences for them is essential in promoting urban biodiversity. At
   the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research site we tested
   the efficacy of native landscaping in residential yards in attracting
   native birds. We also explored the links between socioeconomic factors,
   landscape designs, and urban gradient measurements with the urban bird
   communities. A redundancy analysis suggested that native desert bird
   species increased in abundance in neighborhoods with desert landscaping
   designs, neighborhoods closer to large desert tracts, and higher-income
   neighborhoods. Variance partitioning showed that collectively these
   three sets of environmental variables explained almost 50\% of the
   variation in the urban bird community. Results suggested racial and
   economic inequities in access to biodiversity, whereby predominantly
   Hispanic and lower-income neighborhoods had fewer native birds. We also
   found that residents' satisfaction with bird diversity was positively
   correlated with actual bird diversity. Our study provides new insights
   into the relative importance of socioeconomic variables and common urban
   ecological measurements in explaining urban bird communities. Urban
   planners can use this information to develop residential landscapes that
   support the well-being of both birds and people.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {908},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Gardens are often depicted as green sanctuaries, providing refuges for
   wildlife displaced from the countryside due to intensive farming. While
   gardens have been recognized for their positive impact on biodiversity
   conservation, few studies have investigated the impact of pesticide
   usage in domestic gardens. In this study, we explored how butterfly and
   bumblebee populations in gardens across the UK are influenced by habitat
   quality, urbanisation level and pesticide use. To achieve this, we
   engaged with participants in Garden BirdWatch, a weekly garden wildlife
   recording scheme operated by the British Trust for Ornithology.
   Participants in the study provided data on the attributes of their
   garden and surrounding area and were asked to complete a questionnaire
   about their pesticide practices. Of the 417 gardens from which we
   obtained useful data, we found that 32.6 \% had pesticides applied to.
   Urbanisation and garden quality were the main factors influencing insect
   populations. Butterfly richness was lower in suburban and urban gardens
   and butterfly abundance lower only in suburban gardens when compared to
   rural gardens, but this relationship did not hold for bumblebees.
   Abundance of butterflies and bumblebees, but not their species richness,
   increased with the habitat quality of gardens. Butterflies were lower in
   abundance and richness in more northerly gardens, which was not the case
   for bumblebees. Effects of pesticides were relatively weak, but
   butterfly richness was 7 \% lower in gardens applying any pesticide.
   Overall, our study shows that garden butterfly and bumblebee abundance
   and richness are strongly influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic
   factors, and that garden management can have an important positive
   effect on insect population.},

Abstract = {Urbanisation threatens biodiversity globally, yet some animal
   populations persist within urban landscapes. Conservation of urban
   wildlife has prioritised parks and remnant bushland as critical habitat
   and neglected the role that residential gardens offer for conservation.
   We explored the potential for residential gardens to assist the
   conservation of mammals using an online questionnaire administered to
   residents of two case study cities in Australia to identify how
   widespread mammals in cities can be, which garden features promote
   mammal presence, and if the features varied among species with different
   habitat requirements. From 649 responses we found that three mammal
   species with different habitat requirements occurred in residential
   gardens throughout the city landscape. Garden features promoting mammal
   presence were consistent with broad ecological and habitat requirements
   of each species, but differed among both species and regions. Our study
   demonstrates that residential gardens offer a valuable habitat for
   mammals, and that garden features could be manipulated to promote use of
   gardens by these species. By considering gardens in urban planning and
   management actions aimed at conserving urban wildlife, residential
   gardens offer additional habitat to parks, roadside vegetation and urban
   bushland, and can play a significant role in biodiversity conservation.},

Title = {Exploring the motivations for garden bird feeding in south-east England},

Abstract = {The feeding of wild birds in domestic gardens is one of the most
   widespread and popular forms of human-wildlife interaction throughout
   the Western World. The increasing recognition of the benefits to human
   health and well-being of contact with nature, especially in an
   increasingly urbanized world, reveals the need for a greater
   understanding of why we engage in bird feeding. This will undoubtedly
   result in enhanced benefits of feeding to both people and to the
   biodiversity it supports. Our study aimed to explore the motivations
   behind wild bird feeding in south-east England through both qualitative
   and quantitative approaches. This involved a two-phase process: first,
   the dimensions of involvement were ascertained through semistructured
   interviews with 30 people engaged in feeding. Interrogation of their
   responses was used to construct an online questionnaire. A total of 563
   respondents completed this survey. Analysis of their responses discerned
   a series of themes with the most salient being based on or directed
   toward: pleasure, bird survival, nurture, education of children, and
   connection with nature. These findings reveal that bird feeding is
   underpinned by a complex array of motivations and influences involving
   both personal and environmental benefits.},

Pages = {1-13},

Abstract = {Sugar-water bird feeding in residential backyards is increasingly
   popular, but its effects on wildlife are poorly understood. One concern
   is whether it results in maladaptive behaviour, such as reliance on
   artificial food or increased aggression due to increased density of
   visiting individuals. We studied sugar-water feeder-associated bird
   behaviour in two cities with different climates. We investigate whether
   season, city, or sugar concentration influenced bird foraging activity
   and aggressiveness. We then test whether feeder presence affected
   backyard bird composition. Birds were most aggressive and used
   sugar-water feeders most actively in winter, especially the omnivorous
   native tauhou (Zosterops lateralis). We also found city and seasonal
   differences in sugar-water feeder usage and aggression. Further, in
   Auckland, the city with the warmer climate, New Zealand's largest
   nectarivorous species, tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae), was more
   likely to be aggressive at feeders with higher sugar concentrations but
   foraged longer at feeders with lower sugar concentrations. Neither
   feeder presence nor sugar concentration influenced garden bird species
   richness or abundance. We discuss the effects of sugar-water feeding on
   bird behaviour at the global and local scale and suggest future study
   directions.},

Abstract = {Urban areas are an important and growing land use class. Nearly 5 \% of
   the world is covered with urban development and residential yards make
   up a large proportion of that area. Yards have unique but homogenous
   biological characteristics and are known to be rich with bird fauna, but
   little is known about backyard mammals. We used camera traps to sample
   mammal communities in backyards and urban woodlots in Raleigh-Durham,
   North Carolina, USA and related species activity to yard characteristics
   and levels of neighborhood development. We found a vibrant community of
   smaller herbivores and carnivores using residential yards in urban
   areas, but larger ungulates and carnivores were only detected on the
   urban fringe, or in woodlots. Backyard chicken coops were positively
   correlated with raccoon activity but were not positively correlated with
   other predators, suggesting that chicken coops are attracting raccoons,
   but not other predators, to yards. Fenced-in dogs were negatively
   correlated with most mammals suggesting that confined dogs keep mammals
   out of yards. Unfenced dogs and fences without dogs, showed a more
   varied relationship with mammal activity. These results show an
   encouraging sign of how humans can coexist with wildlife, even in urban
   areas, and suggest some strategies to minimize conflict regarding
   backyard chicken coops and dogs.},

Abstract = {The high valuation of urban green spaces is obvious, given the lost
   economic opportunities their preservation requires. With more and more
   of the world's human population moving to urban areas, experiences with
   urban wildlife are becoming increasingly important for maintenance of
   people's connection to and concern for the natural world. Turtle
   watching provides an opportunity to connect urban residents with
   charismatic species that engender positive aesthetic responses from the
   public. In Erie, Pennsylvania, the Presque Isle Partnership is a
   nonprofit organization dedicated to enhancing visitor experiences at
   Presque Isle State Park. The park is a sandspit peninsula on Lake Erie
   that has abundant turtle populations in its sheltered bays and interior
   wetlands, particularly its populations of the common map turtle,
   Graptemys geographica. The common map turtles of Graveyard Pond have
   long been one of the park's signature wildlife spectacles. A basking
   aggregation that can exceed 100 turtles in late spring and early fall is
   enjoyed by visitors to a shoreline picnic area, canoeists, kayakers, and
   guests on the park's pontoon boat tours. In 2012, the Partnership funded
   construction of a handicapped-accessible turtle observation deck with
   fixed binocular viewfinders and informative signage. Total material cost
   for the project was \$20,466 (similar to\$22,922 in 2020 US dollars);
   labor for construction was donated by local industry. Since its
   construction, the observation deck has become a popular stop for park
   visitors. Similar projects would be suitable for many urban areas in the
   United States and many other countries with watchable turtle populations
   and would enhance urban residents' encounters with urban turtle
   populations.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The majority of the world's population now lives in cities, where
   reduced levels of native biodiversity, coupled with fewer opportunities
   for people to experience nature, are expected to result in an urban
   public increasingly disconnected from the natural environment.
   Residential gardens have great potential to both support native species
   and allow people daily contact with nature. Embracing the
   epistemological assumption that urban residents' interactions with
   nature in their gardens and parks may be complex, unpredictable,
   contradictory, and context-dependent, we used an interpretative
   phenomenological analysis approach to explore the human relationship
   with urban nature in a New Zealand city. We conducted 21 semi-structured
   ``go-along{''} interviews to facilitate a deeper understanding of
   participants' personal experiences of nature in parks and gardens.
   Interviews revealed a tension between stated values and concrete actions
   affecting urban biodiversity in private gardens. This value-action gap
   stemmed from the multiple purposes and values that people hold for their
   gardens, which do not necessarily align with conservation of native
   nature. By recognizing that urban residents hold multiple values and
   want their gardens to fulfill multiple purposes, local authorities
   aiming to promote nature conservation in cities can design wildlife
   gardening programs that meet these multiple needs and reconcile
   conflicting priorities.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Many stressors plague bee populations including habitat fragmentation
   and degradation, as well as pathogens and pesticide exposure. With bee
   communities at risk, conservation efforts are imperative. Although
   recent research has examined bee communities across cities, few studies
   have analyzed variation in human attitudes toward and perceptions of
   bees, or how these perspectives might influence bee conservation. We
   therefore analyzed residents' attitudes toward and perceptions of bees,
   specifically in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. Primarily drawing upon
   2017 survey data (n = 496, 39\% response rate), we posed the following
   questions: 1) What cognitive, environmental, and social factors explain
   whether people like or dislike bees? and 2) How do attitudes and
   perceptions about bees relate to land management practices, specifically
   landscaping choices, herbicide and pesticide use, and desert plantings?
   Overall, attitudes toward bees were mostly neutral with a slight trend
   toward dislike but most residents did not believe bees were problematic
   at their homes. Additional findings reveal that risk perceptions,
   ecological worldviews, and pet ownership significantly explained
   attitudes toward bees. Moreover, people who live closer to desert parks
   had relatively positive attitudes toward bees. Regarding yard management
   practices, both attitudes toward and perceptions of bees were positively
   correlated with adding desert plants to residential yards. Moreover,
   people who use pesticides had more negative attitudes toward bees. Our
   results indicate conservation potential for urban bee populations, for
   example, by planting native vegetation in residential areas near desert
   preserves. We hope this study will result in more attitudinal research
   on bee species and other understudied urban wildlife.},

   Feeding Behavior of Moor Macaques (Macaca maura)},

Volume = {38},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Investigating crop feeding patterns by primates is an increasingly
   important objective for primatologists and conservation practitioners
   alike. Although camera trap technology is used to study primates and
   other wildlife in numerous ways, i.e., activity patterns, social
   structure, species richness, abundance, density, diet, and demography,
   it is comparatively underused in the study of human-primate
   interactions. We compare photographic (N = 210) and video (N = 141) data
   of crop feeding moor macaques (Macaca maura) from remote sensor cameras,
   functioning for 231 trap days, with ethnographic data generated from
   semistructured interviews with local farmers. Our results indicate that
   camera traps can provide data on the following aspects of crop feeding
   behavior: species, crop type and phase targeted, harvesting technique
   used, and daily and seasonal patterns of crop feeding activity. We found
   camera traps less useful, however, in providing information on the
   individual identification and age/sex class of crop feeders, exact group
   size, and amount of crops consumed by the moor macaques. While farmer
   reports match camera trap data regarding crop feeding species and how
   wildlife access the gardens, they differ when addressing crop feeding
   event frequency and timing. Understanding the mismatches between camera
   trap data and farmer reports is valuable to conservation efforts that
   aim to mitigate the conflict between crop feeding wildlife and human
   livelihoods. For example, such information can influence changes in the
   way certain methods are used to deter crop feeding animals from damaging
   crops. Ultimately, we recommend using remote-sensing camera technology
   in conjunction with other methods to study crop feeding behavior.},

Abstract = {1Urban areas are predicted to grow significantly in the foreseeable
   future because of increasing human population growth. Predicting the
   impact of urban development and expansion on mammal populations is of
   considerable interest due to possible effects on biodiversity and
   human-wildlife conflict.
   2The British government has recently announced a substantial housing
   programme to meet the demands of its growing population and changing
   socio-economic profile. This is likely to result in the construction of
   high-density, low-cost housing with small residential gardens. To assess
   the potential effects of this programme, we analysed the factors
   affecting the current pattern of use of residential gardens by a range
   of mammal species using a questionnaire distributed in wildlife and
   gardening magazines and via The Mammal Society.
   3Twenty-two species/species groups were recorded. However, the pattern
   of garden use by individual species was limited, with only six
   species/species groups (bats, red fox Vulpes vulpes, grey squirrel
   Sciurus carolinensis, hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus, mice, voles)
   recorded as frequent visitors to > 20\% of gardens in the survey.
   4There was a high degree of association between the variables recorded
   in the study, such that it was difficult to quantify the effects of
   individual variables. However, all species/species groups appeared to be
   negatively affected by the increased fragmentation and reduced proximity
   of natural and semi-natural habitats, decreasing garden size and garden
   structure, but to differing degrees. Patterns of garden use were most
   clearly affected by house location (city, town, village, rural), with
   garden use declining with increasing urbanization for the majority of
   species/species groups, except red foxes and grey squirrels. Increasing
   urbanization is likely to be related to a wide range of interrelated
   factors, any or all of which may affect a range of mammal species.
   5Overall, the probable effects of the planned housing development
   programme in Britain are not likely to be beneficial to mammal
   populations, although the pattern of use examined in this study may
   represent patterns of habitat selection by species rather than
   differences in distribution or abundance. Consequently, additional data
   are required on the factors affecting the density of species within
   urban environments.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In urban and suburban areas, wildlife and people are often in close
   quarters, leading to human-wildlife interactions (HWI). Understanding
   how wildlife interacts with humans and the built environment is critical
   as urbanization contributes to habitat change and fragmentation
   globally. The environmental drivers that influence HWIs are largely
   unknown in some systems, however, especially across multiple spatial
   scales. Using location and species data from a business that relocates
   snakes across the Phoenix metropolitan area (Arizona, USA), we found the
   most frequently removed were venomous (family Viperidae, e.g.,
   rattlesnakes). Nonvenomous snakes were also removed (family Colubridae,
   e.g., gophersnakes). Using these records, we investigated taxa-specific
   habitat relationships at two spatial scales. The neighborhood scale
   focused on front yard measures of cover and vegetation classes, and the
   landscape scale focused on remote-sensed variables related to vegetation
   indices and degree of urbanization. Both analyses compared areas where
   snakes were removed to random locations in the city to evaluate used and
   available locations of snakes. At the neighborhood scale, snake removals
   (n = 59) occurred in yards with abundant vegetation and debris cover
   opportunities compared to random locations. At the landscape scale,
   snake removal locations (n = 764) had taxa-specific differences, with
   nonvenomous snakes removed from areas of higher urbanization than
   venomous snakes, a pattern was likely related to differences in life
   history and behavior. Environmental variables associated with HWI can
   vary across different spatial scales. Understanding these environmental
   characteristics associated with snake removals from residential can
   focus management activities to reduce potential human-snake conflict.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Gardens provide spaces for connectedness to nature, which contributes to
   human well-being and promotes pro-environmental behavior. However, the
   provision of ecosystem services (ES) in gardens of sub-Saharan Africa is
   challenged by a lack of knowledge, resulting in inefficient gardening
   practices. Stakeholders also influence the manifestation of ES
   provisioning through their perceptions, learning, and decisions. Health
   clinic gardens may be able to address some of these challenges where
   other types of gardens fail because of a lack of awareness of other
   garden benefits and a lack of gardening skills and knowledge, among
   other factors. Thus, this study aimed to assess stakeholder perceptions
   of ES provided by health clinic gardens in the North-West province,
   South Africa. Survey questionnaires were administered to 218
   stakeholders across 105 health clinic gardens to ascertain their
   involvement and prioritization of the ES provided by the gardens and
   their perspectives on gardens in general. The diversity and abundance of
   stakeholders per clinic garden were enumerated based on the respondents'
   reports. Stakeholder prioritization of ES was scored out of 5, where 1
   is the least prioritization. Health clinic gardens have a diversity of
   one to five types of stakeholders per garden, and more than 80\% of the
   gardens were reported to have a groundsman. Stakeholders spent 1.5 +/-
   0.5 to 4.7 +/- 0.12 days/week engaged in garden activities. Groundsmen
   spent the most time (4.7 +/- 0.12 days/week) in the gardens, while
   facility managers spent the least (0.90 +/- 0.12). Regulating and
   cultural ES, each scoring an average of 3.7 out of 5, were perceived as
   the most valuable ES of health clinic gardens. A ``garden{''} was mainly
   associated with vegetable cultivation and rarely linked with recreation
   or aesthetical appreciation. A case for establishing these gardens
   across the country and other developing countries of the Global South
   can be made through the assessment of their potential ES from the
   perspectives of stakeholders. This study addresses this topic and
   contributes to an understanding of the importance of a variety of
   stakeholders for maintaining functional health clinic gardens.},

Abstract = {Bird feeding on residential property is a popular activity throughout
   Western countries. Advocates insist the practice is beneficial, while
   opponents maintain that it can result in a wide range of negative
   outcomes including malnutrition. The biological effects of `backyard
   feeding' were studied in Australian magpies Gymnorhina tibicen during
   the non-breeding season in 1999 in the Greater Brisbane and the Lockyer
   Valley regions, south-east Queensland, Australia. Six magpie populations
   were selected and 70 birds were individually tagged for identification.
   The birds were provided with processed foods, 20-40 g per bird daily. To
   monitor the effects of the food, blood chemistry and body mass (BM) were
   used as indices. Significant effects were observed in BM and plasma
   cholesterol (PC), showing strong sensitivity to food provisioning.
   Significant effects on PC and uric acid were found only when birds were
   fed dog sausage. Results suggest that blood PC levels in magpies are
   readily influenced by, probably, the lipids present in food, and that
   the type of food can affect blood PC levels. These effects may occur
   widely among fed magpies if the influence that we demonstrated at plasma
   level can be generalized. Following the free-ranging study, six magpies
   were captured and subjected to a 6-day captive experiment to determine
   whether the selected foods had the potential to alter the birds' blood
   chemistry. It was found that all of the foods, when provided ad libitum,
   influence at least two of the three blood parameters (PC and
   non-esterified fatty acids). Due to its popularity, wildlife feeding
   will continue. To make wildlife-feeding activities truly sustainable,
   there is a need for further studies. This study clearly demonstrated
   that the physiology of wild magpies can be affected by `backyard
   feeding'.},

Abstract = {Increased urbanization drives habitat loss, yet residential land-use
   represents significant habitat potential for mammals and could provide
   connectivity between patches of green spaces. Diverse mammal communities
   exist across urban gradients, but it is unclear how mammal community
   composition varies within residential lands. We conducted a camera
   trapping study in 36 residential yards across an urban gradient to
   assess the relative contributions of the degree of urbanization in the
   land-use context versus parcel habitat features, such as vegetation
   structure, on mammal community diversity and composition. We
   hypothesized that land-use context would more strongly influence mammal
   community metrics than parcel features, and that there would be
   species-specific differences in response. We detected 14
   non-domesticated mammal species and found that species richness peaked
   in the suburbs and tapered off at the rural and urban ends of the
   gradient in accordance with patterns seen in other taxonomic groups, yet
   rarely quantified in mammals. Large-bodied interior forest species were
   associated with rural sites, urban-dwelling species were associated with
   urban sites, and suburban sites had an overlap of species types.
   Although composition of mammal species in residential yards appears to
   be strongly related to land-use context, which is often outside of
   residents' control, management of parcel habitat features such as
   retention of large mature trees may facilitate connectivity between
   patches of habitat across urbanizing landscapes. Informed residential
   yard management remains an important tool for urban wildlife management
   in an era of global change.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Pest management professionals use anticoagulant rodenticides,
   usually placed in tamper-resistant bait stations, to control commensal
   rodents, but significant concerns remain about exposure of nontarget
   species, especially at the urban-wildland interface. We deployed digital
   cameras to monitor use of bait stations placed in 90 residential yards
   across Orange County, California, USA. Two bait stations, supplied with
   nontoxic bait, were monitored in each yard for approximately 30
   consecutive days during two camera-trapping sessions between December
   2017 and March 2019. One station was placed on the ground, while the
   other was elevated 1-1.5 m to determine if elevating stations could
   reduce nontarget exposure.
   RESULTS Black rats (Rattus rattus L.) were present at 80\% of sites,
   with mean activity ranging from 0 to 9.6 h each night. There were no
   significant differences between elevated and ground stations in the time
   to discovery, time to bait station entry, or nightly activity of rats.
   Rats discovered bait stations more quickly, and mean nightly activity
   was greater, in yards where rats were detected more frequently. Although
   native rodents visited and entered bait stations occasionally, they were
   relatively rare among our sites (13.3\%), and were detected five times
   less often at elevated stations compared to those on the ground. Yards
   visited by these rodents were significantly nearer to areas of green
   open space and natural vegetation, and tended to have no significant
   barriers to entry, e.g. solid fences or walls.
   CONCLUSIONS By elevating bait stations and avoiding placing rodenticides
   in yards that are likely to be visited by wildlife, pest management
   professionals may be able to reduce the risk of nontarget exposure,
   including secondary poisoning of predators and scavengers, while still
   providing effective control of commensal pests.},

Abstract = {As technology mediates more of human experience, effective conservation
   will increasingly rely on understanding how wildlife inhabits the real

   populations and human social and cultural activities. Searches for the
   common names of 68 resident bird species were positively associated with
   estimates of bird population densities across the United States.
   Additional social and cultural predictors that we expected to influence
   state-level interest in local bird species explained little geographic
   variation in search activity. Results were congruent across analyses
   that focused on different bird groups and geographic regions within the
   United States. Our findings suggest that Americans are attuned to the
   avifauna that reside in their state and search for information about
   local species on the Internet. To the extent that searches reflect

   be used to increase the relevance of conservation messaging and the

Abstract = {In many places in the Western Ghats hill ranges of southern India,
   rainforest has been clear-felled in order to grow tea plantations. Such
   plantations now exist as islands of agriculture surrounded by forest
   tracts, most of which are protected as wildlife sanctuaries. We report a
   case study from one such tea garden. We observed a diversity of wild
   mammals, both herbivores and carnivores, using open grass patches,
   swamps and vegetation along streams in the tea garden. Large mammals
   were observed to forage in such areas and return to the adjoining
   forests. Small mammals were either resident or used stream vegetation as
   a corridor to move from one side of the forest to the opposite side.
   Dhole (Cuon alpinus) often preyed on sambar (Cervus unicolor) and even
   denned twice in the estate. We also observed a minimal human-animal
   conflict in the area. Problems such as stealing of meat from sambar
   kills made by dhole, could be overcome by awareness. We propose that
   such areas can be effectively managed such that it could facilitate
   movement of wild mammals with least damage to the commercial activity
   related to tea. Such a wildlife management strategy can become a model
   that could be followed in tea-growing areas throughout the Western

Abstract = {One approach for measuring the potential biodiversity in new urban
   construction projects is through ecological models that predict how
   wildlife will respond. For the United Kingdom, such models have only
   been developed for birds, but to maximise the extent to which models
   represent overall biodiversity, species from different indicator groups
   must be considered.Here, we assess this possibility for butterflies by
   combining citizen science survey data with high-resolution digital maps.
   We derive detailed characteristics of urban landscapes around survey
   sites using previously established methods and quantify their
   relationship to counts of adults of 18 butterfly species in urban and
   peri-urban settings.Higher butterfly counts were found when traversing
   urban sites with larger areas of semi-natural grassland, other managed
   greenspaces and adjacent arable land. Most of the butterfly community
   were found to have negative relationships with highly built-up or
   fragmented landscapes.We found high species-specificity for different
   details of urban form, particularly in habitat elements such as gardens,
   vegetation around railways and grass verges.Policy implications.
   Improving biodiversity is now part of legislation governing new
   construction projects from England and Wales. However, predicting
   quantitative changes from hypothetical land-use modifications remains
   challenging. Our models provide the foundation through which butterfly
   abundance could be integrated into an urban biodiversity assessment
   tool, providing species- and community-level statistics to
   non-specialists from the urban planning and design sector. This would

Abstract = {Context Tree canopy connectivity is important for supporting
   biodiversity. In urban landscapes, empirical examinations of habitat
   connectivity often overlook residential land, though yards and gardens
   often comprise a large portion of urban forests. Objectives We quantify
   structural composition (patches and paths), connectivity and
   fragmentation of an entire tree canopy network spanning 1220 Boston's
   neighborhoods to assess the configuration of the urban forest
   potentially affecting tree-dependent wildlife species, such as some
   birds and arboreal mammals. Methods The urban landscape was classified
   by land use, and residential yards were further subdivided into front
   yards, backyards, and corner yards. Structural composition, connectivity
   and fragmentation of the tree canopy was assessed using morphological
   spatial pattern and network analysis. Canopy metrics were then related
   to the land use of 349,305 property parcels. Results Back yard tree
   canopy cover was 65.23\%. The majority of canopy links were on
   residential land (60.95\% total), and particularly in backyards. Back
   yards contained the highest number of canopy fragments (48.65\% total).
   Fragmentation of the canopy network peaked at similar to 23\% of total
   canopy cover. Canopy fragmentation, distance among patches and their
   shape complexity were lower in neighborhoods with more tree canopy.
   Conclusions The important role that yards have in sustaining canopy
   connectivity across urban landscapes poses challenges and opportunities.
   Urban land management and planning need to protect connectivity links
   within urban forests when located on private residential realm. A
   prioritization strategy aimed at expanding urban tree cover could focus
   on yards to ensure that urban landscape connectivity is maintained and

Abstract = {Raised personal health awareness and social environmental responsibility
   put pressure on the agri-food industry to adopt more sustainable ways of
   production, including the use of more natural ingredients, reducing
   waste, conservation and the regeneration of resources and energy.
   Plant-based colorants are ecologically friendly alternatives to
   artificial food dyes, especially with regards to the current reports on
   the adverse effects of some of the latter on human health. Various
   plants are traditionally used by many cultures to obtain vivid food
   coloration; however, the knowledge and means to produce them becomes
   less and less accessible to urbanized societies, and affordable organic
   alternatives are not always available on the market. An online
   questionnaire was performed to explore the awareness on plant-based dyes
   and pro-environmental attitudes of Bulgarian customers through the lens
   of Orthodox Easter eggs dyeing and the obtaining of plant dyes. From a
   total of 294 adult participants, only 5\% reported a strict preference
   for natural dyes, while more than half of them (54\%) were found to use
   natural and artificial ones concomitantly or switching between both. Of
   45 plant taxa used for egg coloration, 12 were most frequently cited
   with many new additions of imported plants. Most of the used plant-based
   dyes were common fruits, spices, herbal infusions and even food waste
   like onion peels and avocado pits that were readily available from home
   gardens, markets and food shops. Additionally, we made a review of the
   scientific literature regarding their antioxidant and antimicrobial
   activity against food spoilage bacteria and foodborne pathogens isolated
   from eggs. All frequently used taxa were reported to exhibit
   antibacterial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative
   bacteria and possess antioxidant activity due to the presence of various
   polyphenols, essential oils and other compounds. Grape and red wine,
   roselle and stinging nettle are the species with the most diverse
   antibacterial activity, effective against 15 out of the 16 bacterial
   species of spoilage and foodbourn microorganisms included in our focus.
   The antimicrobial activities, however, were found mostly tested against
   bacterial strains in vitro, and further studies are needed to confirm
   their potential antibacterial activity when applied to Easter/boiled
   eggs or other food products. Our findings suggest that traditional
   cultural practices, as a multifaceted and engaging phenomenon, have the
   potential to promote environmental responsibility and a healthy
   lifestyle using both contemporary and traditional knowledge.},

Abstract = {Residential garden ponds contribute significantly to the available

   novel biotic and abiotic characteristics, they are used by a variety of
   wildlife. However, whether they support healthy animals, reproduction
   and recruitment, critical for longer-term sustainability, is largely
   unknown. We addressed this knowledge gap using frogs as a case study
   taxon by investigating species assemblage, size (snout-vent length,
   SVL), body condition (scaled mass index, SMI), reproduction and
   recruitment in urban gardens with ponds relative to natural wetlands in
   southwestern Australia. Based on monthly sampling of 21 urban gardens
   and 6 wetlands between September 2023 and March 2024, we found that
   gardens supported a less diverse species assemblage than wetlands.
   Garden frogs were up to 39.5\% longer in SVL but did not differ in SMI
   to those in wetlands. Of species occurring in both habitats, 75\% (3)
   called earlier and/or for longer in gardens compared to wetlands. Over
   40\% of garden ponds supported reproduction of motorbike frogs (Litoria
   moorei) and of these 45\% supported recently metamorphosed juveniles.
   Reproduction of the other species in gardens was minimal. This study is
   one of few to investigate the ability of urban habitats to support
   critical aspects of life history and demonstrates that residential

Title = {Mesocarnivores in residential yards: influence of yard features on the
   occupancy, relative abundance, and overlap of coyotes, grey fox, and red
   fox},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {51},
Number = {10},
Abstract = {Context. As conversion of natural areas to human development continues,
   there is a lack of information about how developed areas can sustainably
   support wildlife. While large predators are often extirpated from areas
   of human development, some medium-bodied mammalian predators (hereafter,
   mesocarnivores) have adapted to co-exist in human-dominated areas. Aims.
   How human-dominated areas such as residential yards are used by
   mesocarnivores is not well understood. Our study aimed to identify yard
   and landscape features that influence occupancy, relative abundance and
   spatial-temporal overlap of three widespread mesocarnivores, namely,
   coyote (Canis latrans), grey fox (Urocyon cineroargenteus) and red fox
   (Vulpes vulpes). Methods Over the summers of 2021 and 2022, we deployed
   camera-traps in 46 and 96 residential yards, spanning from low-density
   rural areas (<1 home per km2) to more urban areas (589 homes per km2) in
   north-western Arkansas, USA. Key results. We found that mesocarnivore
   occupancy was marginally influenced by yard-level features as opposed to
   landscape composition. Fences reduced the occupancy probability of
   coyotes, although they were positively associated with the total area of
   potential shelter sites in a yard. We found that relative abundance of
   grey fox was highest in yards with poultry, highlighting a likely source
   of conflict with homeowners. We found that all three species were
   primarily nocturnal and activity overlap between the species pairs was
   high. Conclusions Thus, these species may be using spatio-temporal
   partitioning to avoid antagonistic encounters and our data supported
   this, with few examples of species occurring in the same yards during
   the same 24-h period. Implications. As the number of residential yards
   continues to grow, our results suggested that there are ways in which
   our yards can provide resources to mesocarnivores and that homeowners
   also have agency to mitigate overlap with mesocarnivores through
   management of their yard features.},

Abstract = {Although urban domestic gardens hold great significance for biodiversity
   support in cities, these habitats have been relatively insufficiently
   studied, especially in developing country contexts. This paper assesses
   the composition, diversity, density and distribution of plant vegetation
   in urban domestic gardens in the rapidly expanding south Indian city of
   Bangalore. Overall species diversity is high, with 1,668 trees from 91
   species, as well as 192 species of herbs and shrubs encountered from a
   total sample of 328 urban single domestic gardens and shared apartment
   gardens distributed across the city. The majority of species were
   uncommon, found in less than 5 \% of all sampled locations. A high
   proportion of about 30 \% of all species had uses as food or as spices,
   medicinal properties, and/or religious significance. In general, large
   shared apartment gardens and single domestic gardens had a greater
   number of trees with larger size, and greater tree and herb/shrub
   diversity compared to small shared apartment gardens and small to
   moderate sized single domestic gardens. Shared apartment gardens tended
   to harbor relatively distinct sets of species, especially trees, palms
   and plants with largely ornamental significance, while single domestic
   gardens contained a greater proportion of flowering and medicinal plants
   used in daily worship, as well as fruit bearing and spice bearing plants
   and trees. Residents observed a wide range of other animal and insect
   species in their gardens, but also indicated a decrease in wildlife
   biodiversity over time. The majority of residents observed some cultural
   practices associated with feeding of urban wildlife and insects
   including the provision of rice and water for birds, and of sugar for
   ants. The results of this research provide a comprehensive description
   of plant diversity and distribution in single domestic gardens and
   shared apartment gardens of different sizes, which can be very important
   for citizen groups, planners and administrators working towards urban
   planting and greening in the south Indian city of Bangalore. They also
   supplement the extremely limited information currently available on
   urban domestic gardens outside of cities in the west.},

Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {11},
Pages = {927-938},
Abstract = {Context. Small mammals may traverse the urban fringe and use both
   natural and anthropogenic resources. In Australia, human commensal black
   rats (Rattus rattus) and native long-nosed bandicoots (Perameles nasuta)
   are important tick hosts, which can be found persisting at the urban
   fringe, leading to human-wildlife conflict. Aims. We aimed to (1)
   determine the relative activity of small mammals in yards and
   associations with yard attributes, (2) compare activity of black rats
   and long-nosed bandicoots in bushland with activity in yards and (3)
   determine the proportion of black rats and long-nosed bandicoots that
   crossed the urban fringe. We predicted that native bandicoots would be
   more active in bushland habitats and that black rats would be more
   active in yards. Methods. We used camera trapping in 56 residential
   yards, 18 of which were paired with adjacent bushland to measure small
   mammal activity in the two habitats. We recorded yard attributes and
   examined these associations using generalised linear models. We used
   isodar analysis to investigate black rat preferences of bushland habitat
   compared with yards, and we used Rhodamine B baiting to investigate
   movement at the urban fringe. Key results. We found that black rats were
   the most active small mammal in residential yards and were detected in
   more yards than other small mammals, followed by bandicoots. Black rat
   activity was greater in yards adjacent to bushland, but no other yard
   attributes were associated with black rat and bandicoot activity.
   Overall, activity tended to be higher in bushland than in yards at
   paired locations. Conclusions. Our findings suggest residential yards
   likely provide high-quality resources for long-nosed bandicoots. Low
   rates of movement at the urban fringe (6\%), and a preference for
   bushland at low densities suggests that black rats may be synanthropic
   rather than commensal, occupying an urban niche but not depending on
   anthropogenic resources as expected. Implications. Residential
   properties located adjacent to bushland may be exposed to increased
   black rat activity in yards. Future work should consider how introduced
   rats may be controlled in bushland to assist urban rat control efforts
   and avoid non-target impacts. Residential yards are likely to be
   important habitat for the persistence of long-nosed bandicoots in urban

Title = {Susceptibility of Spring-Flowering Garden Plants to Herbivory by Mule
   Deer},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Many people look forward to spring flowers, only to discover that mule
   deer (Odocoileus hemionus) have eaten the sprouting plants and flower
   buds. One potential method to prevent this problem is to grow
   unpalatable flowering plants in gardens where deer herbivory is
   expected, but this requires knowledge about the relative palatability of
   plant species. We examined spring-flowering plants in gardens located in
   Cache County, Utah, USA (2010 through 2017), and recorded the proportion
   of leaves and flower buds browsed by mule deer. Mule deer browsing was
   greatest on tulips (Tulipa spp.), grape hyacinths (Muscari spp.), and
   crocuses (Crocus spp.) and lowest on iris (Iris spp.) and daffodils
   (Narcissus spp.) We hypothesized that the first plants to sprout in the
   spring experienced greater levels of deer herbivory because of the lack
   of alternate plants that deer can browse during that time of year. To
   test this hypothesis, we started plants in greenhouses so that they
   sprouted at the same time. We then placed these plants in locations
   throughout Cache Valley where there were deer trails and deer feces.
   Among these plants, tulip, liatris (Liatris spp.), and grape hyacinth
   were browsed heavily, suggesting that deer found these plants palatable.
   In contrast, crocus were rarely eaten, suggesting that deer damage on
   this plant results more from its early sprouting rather than its
   palatability. Planting unpalatable plants may be a viable approach to
   reducing homeowners' angst from finding that their spring-flowering
   plants have been browsed. Wildlife biologists and Cooperative Extension
   agents should find our results useful when guiding homeowners in
   selecting which spring-flowering plants to grow in areas where deer
   herbivory can be expected. (C) 2018 The Wildlife Society.},

Title = {Taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional composition and homogenization
   of residential yard vegetation with contrasting management},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {202},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urban biotic homogenization is expected to be especially important in
   residential yards, where similar human preferences and management
   practices across environmentally heterogeneous regions might lead to the
   selection of similar plant species, closely related species, and/or
   species with similar sets of traits. We investigated how different yard
   management practices determine yard plant diversity and species
   composition in six cities of the U.S., and tested the extent to which
   yard management results in more homogeneous taxonomical, phylogenetic,
   and functional plant communities than the natural areas they replace or
   than relatively unmanaged areas at the residential-wildland interface
   ({''}interstitial{''} areas). We categorized yards based on fertilizer
   input frequency and landscaping style: high-input lawns, low-input
   lawns, and wildlife-certified yards. We defined homogenization as
   decreased average beta-diversity and decreased variance in
   alpha-diversity in yards when compared to natural and interstitial
   areas. We found that all residential yard types regardless of their
   management were functionally more homogeneous for both alpha- and
   beta-diversity than the natural and interstitial areas. Nevertheless,
   wildlife-certified yards were functionally more similar to natural areas
   than lawn-dominated yard types. All yard types were also more
   homogeneous in phylogenetic alpha-diversity compared to natural and
   interstitial areas, but more heterogenous in taxonomic alpha-diversity.
   Within yards, taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity were
   weakly correlated, highlighting the importance of examining multiple
   dimensions of biodiversity beyond taxonomic metrics. Our findings
   underscore the ecological importance of gardening practices that both
   support biodiversity and create residential plant communities that are
   functionally heterogeneous.},

Title = {The ecological role of native-plant landscaping in residential yards to
   birds during the nonbreeding period},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Residential yards are a form of urban land use that cover a considerable
   amount of area in cities worldwide and provide important habitat for
   wildlife, especially when landscaped with native plants. Nevertheless,
   most native-plant landscaping and wildlife research in the northern
   temperate regions of the world has been conducted during the spring and
   summer breeding period, leaving a gap in our understanding of the
   importance of residential yards and native plants as habitats for
   animals during the nonbreeding period. To fill this gap, we quantified
   the ecological role of native-landscaped yards to avifauna throughout
   Greater Los Angeles (LA), California, during the winter nonbreeding
   period, which is a time of year when the region hosts a high abundance
   and diversity of migratory and resident birds. We surveyed birds and
   habitat features from October to March of 2020 and 2021 at 22 pairs of
   native- and non-native-landscaped yards plus 10 additional
   native-landscaped yards. We had three objectives for our study. First,
   we compared avifaunal communities, including feeding and nonfeeding
   behaviors, and habitat features between native and non-native-landscaped
   yards. Second, we quantified relationships between habitat features and
   bird richness, abundance, and feeding and nonfeeding behaviors-focusing
   on species affiliated with urban or natural terrestrial ecosystems of
   the region. Third, we documented feeding and nonfeeding behaviors by
   birds with native and non-native plants. Native-landscaped yards had a
   greater cover of native trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, and a
   higher cover of natural habitat elements, including leaf litter and
   bare-ground cover. Bird richness and abundance-especially bird species
   affiliated with tree- and shrub-dominated cosystems-were greater in
   native than non-native-landscaped yards. Further, yards with a higher
   cover of native plants supported greater numbers of feeding birds, with
   individuals focusing their foraging behaviors on distinct native trees
   and shrubs, including Quercus spp. (oak), Heteromeles spp. (toyon),
   Arctostaphylos spp. (manzanita), and Salvia spp. (sage). Our results
   suggest that residential yards landscaped with native plants provide
   important habitat for birds during the nonbreeding period and are a
   viable approach for residents and cities if improving conditions for
   birds throughout the annual cycle is a goal.},

Title = {A local ecological knowledge-based assessment of anthropodependence for
   large mammals in anthropogenic landscapes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {290},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Humans have shaped the environment through landscape transformation,
   disturbance, and resource exploitation, leading to major habitat
   modification and fragmentation. Mammal species are massively threatened
   by these changes and their diversity implies various responses to human
   disturbance. It is essential to understand the conditions for their
   persistence in human-dominated landscapes, and the drivers of
   humans-mammals' coexis- tence to apply relevant conservation measures.
   The Garden Route Biosphere Reserve, in South Africa, a mosaic landscapes
   where human activities and wildlife meet, is an ideal site to examine
   how anthropogenic attributes influence wildlife occurrence. To maximise
   our area coverage through a replicable, low-cost protocol, we designed
   an online survey aimed at residents to investigate the effect of
   landscape metrics and property attributes - the availability and type of
   anthropogenic resources, the integrity and type of natural habitats,
   structural disturbances and interferences - on the persistence of
   mammals in such environments. We collected data from 247 respondents and
   modelled the drivers of occurrence for 14 mammal species (>500 g). We
   found speciesspecific responses to synthetic variables describing
   anthropogenic features in the studied landscape and used the
   anthropodependence framework to categorise species profiles. We showed
   that human disturbance combined with the availability of anthropogenic
   resources and natural habitats defined various categories of species
   profiles, which should require differential conservation actions. Local
   ecological knowledge proved promising to understand conditions for
   mammal persistence in human-dominated landscapes. This method also
   allowed researchers to engage with a wide variety of stakeholders, thus
   creating a hub for knowledge exchange.},

Abstract = {Building and preserving a network of greenways can be an intricate
   activity requiring interdisciplinary collaboration. Greenway segments
   often require local input and participation. In addition, greenways are
   not necessarily generic open spaces, but can be managed structurally to
   fulfill specific spatial and temporal requirements. This paper describes
   local activities in the Fargo (North Dakota)-Moorhead (Minnesota)
   metropolitan area related to preserving and embellishing the greenway
   focused around the Red River Valley of the North. This greenway is part
   of a larger Western Hemisphere greenway, composed of riparian corridors
   operating as wildlife habitat migration flyways and as resident wildlife
   habitat. Local activities include demonstration gardens, comprehensive
   corridor planning, habitat analysis, and revegetation studies. From 1985
   to 1990, four spatial treatment investigations were completed, one
   spatial planning study was prepared, and five demonstration gardens were
   built. The spatial treatment investigations revealed that the wildlife
   occupying the greenway could be divided into four habitat-use
   dimensions, suggesting four important habitat associations for the
   greenway. The study also revealed three distinct vegetation zones for
   re-establishing herbaceous vegetation in non-wooded planting conditions.
   In addition, one experiment indicated that replanting the disturbed
   woodland corridor was not influenced by seedling size and that Fraxinus
   pennsylvanica seedlings were highly successful at surviving in a gap
   opening within the forest corridor, In the last experiment, a seeding
   application rate study indicated that seeding rates three times higher
   than recommended rates resulted in improved vegetation cover of
   non-wooded herbaceous vegetation planting sites. The spatial planning
   study illustrated landscape patterns for the greenway composed of a
   continuous tree canopy corridor, augmented by herbaceous vegetation
   patches, food plots, and snags. To build and manage the greenway, this
   investigation reaffirms the importance of multi-disciplinary
   collaboration, local participation, and the potential individualistic
   structure of a greenway. The study suggests that both broad landscape
   planning visions and detailed site endeavors are necessary to understand
   and manage the greenway successfully.},

Abstract = {Smooth-coated otters (Lutrogale perspicillata) were transient in
   Singapore before one resident family group was observed in 1998,
   presumably having recolonized from Peninsular Malaysia. A population
   survey in 2017 revealed a minimum of 11 groups and 79 individuals. Since
   then, movements of otter groups within urban areas have led to
   increasing numbers of human-otter encounters, including conflicts. We
   determined the current abundance, population structure, and distribution
   of smooth-coated otters in Singapore. We assessed seven sampling zones
   nationwide through verified sighting records and social media. Mortality
   records from 2019 to 2021 were sourced from the Otter Working Group and
   Wildlife Reserves Singapore. In early 2021, there were a minimum of 17
   groups and 170 individuals. Groups ranged from 2 to 24 individuals.
   Smooth-coated otters occupy coastal areas, waterways, reservoirs, and
   sites within the city center in urban gardens and ponds. Following
   territorial conflicts at waterways, smooth-coated otter groups moved
   into the urban matrix. Vehicle collisions are the main cause of
   mortality and are frequent at dams separating freshwater and coastal
   habitats. While there is a clear increase in smooth-coated otter numbers
   since 2017, there remain multiple natural and human-caused threats to
   otter persistence.},

Number = {A},
Pages = {42-50},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Understanding how introduced plants reduce food web complexity is
   critical to effective conservation management within human-dominated
   systems. In urban breeding birds, the paucity of dietary specialists
   suggests that a lack of food resources, such as arthropod prey essential
   for reproduction and survival, may contribute to bird declines. Local
   plant species composition and abundance is influenced by the landscaping
   decisions of private homeowners and may be contributing to differences
   in insect prey availability. In this study, we examined whether
   non-native plants are a limiting factor to a resident breeding
   insectivore, the Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). We used
   caterpillar counts, chickadee foraging observations and
   detection-corrected hierarchical models, to determine the influence of
   local landscaping features on insect food availability, chickadee tree
   preference, site occupancy, site abundance and breeding territory
   selection. Native plants were more likely to host a higher biomass of
   caterpillars compared to non-native plants, and chickadees strongly
   preferred to forage in native plants that supported the most
   caterpillars. In addition, chickadees were less likely to breed in yards
   as the dominance of non-native plants increased. Chickadee occupancy
   increased with tree basal area and chickadee abundance declined as
   impermeable surface area increased and basal area decreased. Our results
   demonstrate that non-native plants reduce habitat suitability for
   chickadees by reducing insect food available for breeding. Improving
   human-dominated landscapes as wildlife habitat should include increasing
   native, and arthropod-producing, plant species to effectively support
   the life history needs of insectivorous birds.},

Abstract = {The adaptation of birds to urban environments has created direct hazards
   to air transportation with the potential for catastrophic incidents.
   Bird-aircraft collisions involving Canada geese (Branta canadensis;
   goose) pose greater risks to aircraft than many bird species due to
   their size and flocking behavior. However, information on factors
   driving movements of geese near airports and within aircraft
   arrival/departure areas for application to management are limited. To
   address this need, we deployed 31 neck collar-mounted global positioning
   system transmitters on Canada geese near Midway International Airport in
   Chicago, Illinois, USA during November 2015 to February 2016. We used
   the movement data obtained to model environmental and behavioral factors
   influencing the intersection of goose movements (i.e., transition from 1
   location to another) with air operations areas (i.e., aircraft flight
   paths). Of 3,008 goose movements recorded, 821 intersected a 3-km buffer
   around the airport representing U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
   recommended distances from wildlife attractants, and 399 intersected
   flight paths for approaching and landing aircraft. The effects of
   weather (i.e., snow cover, temperature, wind speed) on the probability
   of geese flying varied with different air operation areas while certain
   habitat resources greatly increased the probability of intersection. For
   example, the juxtaposition of foraging (railyards with spilled grain)
   and loafing areas (rooftops) near the airport led to a higher
   probability of movements intersecting important air operations areas.
   The average altitude of flying geese was 29.8 m above the ground,
   resulting in the greatest risk of collision being within 0.5 km of the
   end of runways. We suggest airport goose collision mitigation management
   actions, such as reducing habitat resources near the airport and using
   focused nonlethal harassment or physical modifications, when guided by
   animal movement data, may further mitigate bird-strike risks.},

Abstract = {Urban agriculture is a unique form of agriculture that can provide
   fresh, local produce for urban residents, and may benefit biodiversity
   by decreasing the need to expand agriculture into natural areas as well
   as enhancing biodiversity in urban areas. However, although urban
   agriculture is also often cited as promoting biodiversity in urban
   areas, the extent of empirical evidence for such claims has not been
   studied. Here we systematically review the relationship between urban
   agriculture and biodiversity in the scientific literature. We strictly
   define urban agriculture as areas in cities that grow produce
   specifically for human consumption. We examined 148 papers from 2000 to
   2017, of which only 24 studies fit our definition of urban agriculture,
   and of those, only 18 both involved urban agriculture and measured
   biodiversity. Of the studies that did measure biodiversity, some showed
   increases in diversity compared to urban vacant lots, but other showed
   no difference. Moreover, these studies were mostly focused on plants and
   invertebrates and were conducted almost exclusively in North America. In
   order to use the generalization that urban agriculture will have a
   positive influence on urban biodiversity, more studies will need to be
   conducted across a wider geographic range worldwide (particularly in
   developing countries in the tropics) and on a greater diversity of
   species and taxa (e.g., herpetiles, birds and small mammals). Such
   studies will likely increase in conservation importance as urban
   expansion and agricultural demands increase globally.},

Abstract = {Urban green spaces provide many benefits, including to human wellbeing,
   ecosystem services, and urban wildlife. Thus, there are many reasons to
   green up urban spaces, especially by using native species. Furthermore,
   urban green spaces are suited to enhancing biodiversity without
   negatively impacting food or fiber production. Municipalities and
   private landowners invest substantially in landscaping and its
   maintenance. However, much of that outlay supports non-native plants
   that may be less adapted to local conditions such as rainfall patterns
   and temperature ranges, thus having greater resource requirements, as
   well as being less supportive of native wildlife and possessing a
   greater potential of becoming invasive. Here, we explore ways to
   increase the use of native plant species in urban settings to reduce the
   need for watering or chemical application, enhance the support of native
   species, and reduce the risk of invasion to urban and ex-urban habitats.
   We identify three main impediments: the perception of native species as
   less aesthetically pleasing, the availability of native plants in the
   nursery industry, and the willingness of policymakers to take supportive
   measures. We propose methods to address all three, providing successful
   examples from a number of US localities and a case study that
   demonstrates what drivers might exist and what actions remain to be

Abstract = {Invertebrates are generally regarded with apathy, distaste, and fear in

   a 48-item, paper questionnaire. The results indicated that adolescents
   were only somewhat knowledgeable about bee biology and services, and
   they confused bees with other flying insects, especially those with
   black-and-yellow coloration. Adolescents regarded bees with a generally
   neutral attitude; their knowledge and attitudes were correlated in a
   positive manner. Various bee-related experiences were linked to
   adolescents' knowledge and attitudes and may have influenced bee-related
   behavior. In particular, students who engaged in gardening and lawn-care
   activities demonstrated higher levels of knowledge and more positive
   attitudes. This study provides insight into the relationships between
   experiences and knowledge of, and attitudes toward, invertebrates and
   suggests that engaging in certain outdoor activities may promote
   positive attitudes toward bees among adolescents.},

Title = {Squirrel glider home ranges near urban edges in eastern Australia},

Volume = {285},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Conservation biology and landscape ecology are increasingly concerned
   with the effects of urbanization on wildlife, including the influences
   of habitat edges. This is particularly important in landscapes where a
   restriction on species home-range movements may reduce an animal's
   ability to access habitat resources, which ultimately reduces population
   viability. Despite this, there is limited information available on the
   movement behavior of wildlife at forest edges adjoining urban areas. We
   addressed this by radiotracking 30 squirrel gliders Petaurus
   norfolcensis in forest interiors and near road and residential edges in
   the fragmented urban landscape of south-east Queensland, Australia. An
   assessment of fixed-kernel (FK100\% and FK50\%) and minimum convex
   polygon (MCP100\%) methods revealed that FK provided the most reliable
   home-range estimates. We applied a general linear model to test the
   influence of season, age and sex relative to habitat type (forest
   interiors, road edge, residential edge) on squirrel glider home-range
   size (FK95\% \& FK50\%). We found that squirrel gliders living in
   interior habitats had significantly larger home ranges (7.07 ha +/-
   0.43) than individuals living near roads (3.79 ha +/- 0.22) and
   residential areas (3.40 ha +/- 0.26). Similarly, home-range core areas
   (FK50\%) were significantly larger in forest interiors (1.49 +/- 0.13
   ha) than near road (0.78 +/- 0.07 ha) and residential edges (0.70 +/-
   0.08 ha). We also found that squirrel gliders regularly cross narrow
   roads up to 20m wide and with a tree gap up to 15m to access adjacent
   vegetation, and are willing to utilize foraging resources in residential
   backyards. Changes in squirrel glider home ranges near edges identified
   in this study have implications for understanding how this species
   responds to urban edges, and we highlight important areas for future
   edge-related studies to correctly inform conservation and management.},

Title = {Species traits explain public perceptions of human-bird interactions},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The impacts of urbanization on bird biodiversity depend on
   human-environment interactions that drive land management. Although a
   commonly studied group, less attention has been given to public
   perceptions of birds close to home, which can capture people's direct,
   everyday experiences with urban biodiversity. Here, we used ecological
   and social survey data collected in the metropolitan region of Phoenix,
   Arizona, USA, to determine how species traits are related to people's
   perceptions of local bird communities. We used a trait-based approach to
   classify birds by attributes that may influence human-bird interactions,
   including color, size, foraging strata, diet, song, and cultural niche
   space based on popularity and geographic specificity. Our classification
   scheme using hierarchical clustering identified four trait categories,
   labeled as Metropolitan (gray, loud, seedeaters foraging low to ground),
   Familiar (yellow/brown generalist species commonly present in suburban
   areas), Distinctive (species with distinguishing appearance and song),
   and Hummingbird (hummingbird species, small and colorful). Strongly held
   beliefs about positive or negative traits were also more consistent than
   ambivalent ones. The belief that birds were colorful and unique to the
   regional desert environment was particularly important in fortifying
   perceptions. People largely perceived hummingbird species and birds with
   distinctive traits positively. Similarly, urban-dwelling birds from the
   metropolitan trait group were related to negative perceptions, probably
   due to human-wildlife conflict. Differences arose across
   sociodemographics (including income, age, education, and Hispanic/Latinx
   identity), but explained a relatively low amount of variation in
   perceptions compared with the bird traits present in the neighborhood.
   Our results highlight how distinctive aesthetics, especially color and
   song, as well as traits related to foraging and diet drive perceptions.
   Increasing people's direct experiences with iconic species tied to the
   region and species with distinguishing attributes has the potential to
   improve public perceptions and strengthen support for broader
   conservation initiatives in and beyond urban ecosystems.},

   monitoring},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {196},

Abstract = {As urbanization accelerates worldwide, municipalities are attempting to
   construct new green spaces within their borders. The perceived
   ecological value of these places is frequently tied to their ability to
   attract urban wildlife, such as birds, which can easily be observed and
   enjoyed. As one strategy, stormwater is now frequently managed with
   green infrastructure: planted areas that retain and treat stormwater
   rather than merely directing it to surface waters. While these practices
   have the potential to provide habitat for urban wildlife, the ecological
   effects of these systems are largely unknown. To assess whether one
   green infrastructure project increases habitat value, we used passive
   acoustic monitoring to survey urban bird communities in and near a large
   green infrastructure project in Columbus, Ohio (USA). Bird communities
   near bioretention cells (rain gardens) were compared to those at nearby
   lawns and remnant or restored natural areas. We found that recently
   installed bioretention cells tended to support more omnivores,
   lower-canopy foraging species, and species from a higher diversity of
   feeding guilds than did nearby lawn control sites. We were unable to
   detect effects of nearby bioretention installations on bird species
   richness at other sites. The observed differences in species richness
   were fairly small, and we urge caution when anticipating the habitat
   value of bioretention cells, at least for bird species. However, the
   results that we observed suggest that bioretention cells could have a
   more positive impact on bird communities in different contexts or using
   different design strategies. The bioretention cells surveyed in this
   study were small and only planted in grasses and forbs, potentially
   limiting their ability to offer complex habitat. They were also
   relatively young, and future work is needed to determine their long-term
   effect on avian communities and biodiversity of other taxa.},

Abstract = {Human-dominated landscapes represent one of the most rapidly expanding
   and least-understood ecosystems on earth. Yet, we know little about
   which features in these landscapes promote sustainable wildlife
   populations. Historically, in urban areas, landowners have converted
   native plant communities into habitats dominated by nonnative species
   that are not susceptible to pest damage and require little maintenance.
   However, nonnative plants are also poor at supporting insects that are
   critical food resources for higher order consumers. Despite the logical
   connection, no study has examined the impact of nonnative plants on
   subsequent population responses of vertebrate consumers. Here, we
   demonstrate that residential yards dominated by nonnative plants have
   lower arthropod abundance, forcing resident Carolina chickadees (Poecile
   carolinensis) to switch diets to less preferred prey and produce fewer
   young, or forgo reproduction in nonnative sites altogether. This leads
   to lower reproductive success and unsustainable population growth in
   these yards compared with those with >70\% native plant biomass. Our
   results reveal that properties landscaped with nonnative plants function
   as population sinks for insectivorous birds. To promote sustainable food
   webs, urban planners and private landowners should prioritize native
   plant species.},

Abstract = {Understanding patterns of habitat selection and factors affecting space
   use is fundamental in animal conservation. In urban landscapes, such
   knowledge can be used to advise householders on how best to manage their
   gardens for wildlife. In this study, we tracked 28 West European
   hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), a species of conservation concern in
   the UK, in an area of high-density housing using radio and GPS tags to
   quantify patterns of habitat use and identify factors associated with
   the proportion of time spent in individual gardens. Both males and
   females exhibited a preference for residential gardens, but there were
   subtle differences between the sexes in relation to house type and front
   versus back gardens. Hedgehogs spent significantly more time in gardens
   where artificial food was provided, where a compost heap was present, if
   foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were infrequent visitors, if it rained overnight
   and as daylength increased (i.e., shorter nights); garden use was not
   significantly associated with variables potentially likely to reflect
   invertebrate prey abundance. These data suggest that the primary
   positive action that householders can undertake for urban hedgehogs is
   providing supplementary food. However, householders often feed hedgehogs
   after they know they are already visiting their garden. Consequently,
   the presence of artificial food may make it difficult to identify other
   important influences affecting garden use. Finally, we report that a GPS
   fix acquisition rate < 60\% likely had no major effect on the results of
   our analyses, but should be a consideration in future studies using this
   technique on this species and in this habitat.},

Title = {Raptors, racing pigeons and perceptions of attacks},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Raptors are often the cause of human-wildlife conflict because they may
   predate economically valuable species, and it is the perceived extent of
   predation that may augment conflict between raptors and people who keep
   and race pigeons. This study uses data obtained through questionnaires
   and an online raptor-attack reporting feature to investigate the
   frequency of racing pigeon losses and the perceptions of pigeon
   fanciers. Responses suggest that those who kept more pigeons and entered
   more races lost a higher proportion of pigeons. Losses were also
   influenced by the predatory species: sparrowhawks (Accipter nisus) were
   more likely to attack pigeons at lofts, whilst peregrines (Falco
   peregrinus) were more likely to attack pigeons during training, with
   patterns linked to the raptors' breeding seasons. Pigeon fanciers were
   almost unanimous in their perception that raptors threaten the future of
   the hobby. Previous studies show that only a small proportion of racing
   pigeons are likely to be lost to raptors, yet pigeon fanciers believe
   that raptors are the main cause of losses, highlighting a possible
   mismatch between the perceived and actual causes of loss. This
   misconception may be a main source of this human-raptor conflict, so
   educating pigeon fanciers about the true impact of raptors could help to
   alleviate the issue. A shift in the beginning of the pigeon racing
   season by one month, and careful sighting of pigeon lofts in gardens,
   are also recommended in order to reduce raptor attacks.},

   Distribution, diffusion, and mitigation},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The conflict between humans and wild animals is a special type of
   phenomena between human development and wild animal conservation, not
   only leading to massive economic loss to local residents, but also
   imposing severe impacts upon the production and living activities and
   even personal safety of the residents. Human-elephant conflict has
   existed as a phenomenon of human settlement development for more than 20
   years in Xishuangbanna, China. There are periodic incidents of wild
   elephants hurting/killing people as well as feeding on and destroying
   subsistence and cash crops. It is an increasingly urgent and important
   issue for China to resolve while protecting and managing Asian
   elephants. Our study employed an Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis model
   to perform a risk assessment of areas where the Asian elephant currently
   is distributed and to predict future risks. It employed a Circuit Theory
   model based on random walk theory to predict multiple potential movement
   or migration pathways of Asian elephants within Xishuangbanna. The
   results indicated that: (1) the regions with human-elephant conflict
   risk in Xishuangbanna Prefecture had an area of about 4349.08 km(2),
   accounting for 22.77\% of the total prefecture area, with the risk
   regions primarily present in the middle and north parts of Menghai
   County and Jinghong City and in Mengla County in which there was a wide
   geographical distribution covering from the south to the north; (2) The
   regions of agriculture and garden that were close to Asian elephant
   distribution and roads were likely occurring risk; (3) There were more
   potential movement paths of elephants within Mengyang and Menghai
   distribution regions, which indicated that the connection of these areas
   was better. While the potential movement paths of elephants within
   Mengla and Shangyong were little; (4) There were some potential movement
   paths between different distribution areas of Asian elephant, but the
   migration possibility of elephants in different distribution areas was
   decreasing due to natural barriers (Mengyang-Menghai has Lancang river)
   and discontinuous potential paths between Mengla and Shangyong.
   Additionally, we discussed that created ecological corridors between
   different natural reserves to allow more dispersal and gene flow of
   elephants and diminish conflict between human and elephant. We also put
   forward compensation suggestions in different risk area. We hope our
   analytical methods can be applied, improved and expanded to other areas
   with similar wildlife damage. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by

   (Halcyon sancta), and a shining cuckoo (Chrysococcyx lucidus). Only nine
   skinks (Cyclodina aenea) and one frog (Litoria raniformis) were brought
   in. The abundance of birds and reptiles in the garden showed no apparent
   change over the 17 years compared with the previous 15-year-period

Abstract = {Wildlife living in the suburbs faces the challenge of dealing with human
   presence and yard management (including the occurrence of pets) which
   vary at the scale of the house block. This study examined the influence
   of ecological factors (e.g. extent of grass and food availability) and
   anthropogenic factors (e.g. human activity and garden usage) on breeding
   site choice and reproductive success of the ground-nesting masked
   lapwing Vanellus miles on Phillip Island, Australia. Lapwings nested
   less frequently in residential properties (high levels of human usage)
   compared with vacant blocks and holiday houses. They were also more
   likely to breed on properties with high food availability and larger
   areas of grass. None of these variables influenced clutch size or the
   probability of eggs hatching, although larger clutches and higher
   hatching rates tended to be associated with more food. This study shows
   that, for an urban exploiting species, habitat quality is not homogenous
   at the scale of the house block, and that human activity is avoided by a

Title = {Barriers and enablers for private residential urban food gardening: The
   case of the City of Hobart, Australia},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {126},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Home food gardening is an important component of urban agriculture and
   sustainable food systems. However, globally there has been limited
   research into the barriers and enablers to home food gardening in
   cities. This study used an exploratory approach, utilising a
   questionnaire survey of households, and in-depth interviews with
   gardening experts, to assess barriers and enablers to home food
   gardening in the City of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. Overall, nine
   themes were identified that were common across both survey and interview
   data. These were time, cost, space, knowledge, ownership, soil, wildlife
   and pests, mobility, support and access, and community. Barriers vary
   depending on individual circumstances and are often compounding. Our
   results indicate that while many households are now growing food, or are
   interested in growing food, there are limitations on the percentage of
   food intake that households can grow at home. Key factors to growing
   more food include control over property, available land, and gardening
   experience and know-how. Our findings highlight the need for policy,
   programs, and resources, especially at the level of local governments,
   that can contribute to an increase in the amount of local, home grown
   food in cities.},

   to adapt and succeed in urban areas. This research assess proximity and
   relationships between Wied's marmoset Callithrix kuhlii, domestic
   animals and residents of Ilheus, Bahia, Brazil. We collected data on the
   species' urban ecology and biology, since it has been little studied so
   far. Tools for data gathering included semi-structured interviews,
   direct observations and GPS-mapping. There were sightings within the
   three major districts of Ilheus, with 37\% of positive questionnaires (n
   = 359) for marmoset sighting at least weekly. Therefore, marmosets were
   considered common in this city. Most records and frequent sightings were
   associated with secondary forest fragments, backyards with fruit trees
   and mangroves. Marmosets travel among urban fragments using electrical
   and phone wires and crossing roads. There is a relatively small number
   of accidents when compared to the number of sightings, with
   electrocution as the most common. Visitation of marmosets to households,
   attracted by food provisioning, was considered frequent. People feel
   pity for the marmosets and lure them to their houses through food, but
   offered items are not always suitable. Marmoset exploration of uncommon
   habitats, such as mangroves, might be driven by a lack of larger forest
   fragments within the city.},

Abstract = {Predicted rapid increases in urbanization in the face of accelerating
   biodiversity loss underscores the need for urban development that
   promotes, rather than displaces, native plants and animals. One approach
   for increasing urban biodiversity is through the development of ``green
   infrastructure{''}. Although research has explored urban-rural gradients
   and the overall value of urban green infrastructure, few studies have
   investigated the habitat value for wildlife of different types of urban
   greenspace. Here, we use a well-established metric in ecology, giving
   up-densities (GUDs), to compare foraging costs for a common urban
   wildlife species, the eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis),
   among three green infrastructure categories: municipal parks, college
   campuses, and residential yards. We found that GUDs for gray squirrels
   did not differ significantly among location categories after controlling
   for proximity to roads, but proximity to roads was associated with
   significantly higher GUDs in all locations. In an explicit test, we also
   found that both proximity to roads and traffic volume were associated
   with higher GUDs. We also found that maximum distance from roads was
   significantly higher for campuses and parks than for residential yards,
   indicating a greater proportion of the area of campuses and parks is
   ``away from roads{''} compared to residential yards. Our results
   indicate that vehicle traffic may contribute significantly to an ``urban
   landscape of fear{''} for gray squirrels and suggest that campus and
   park configurations that reduce road effects could improve habitat
   quality for squirrels and possibly other animals.},

Abstract = {Cemeteries are globally culturally protected greenspaces in cities that
   meet different societal needs and often harbor high biodiversity. To
   harness the potential of cemeteries as urban green infrastructure,
   stakeholders need to understand why people visit cemeteries and their
   preferences. We conducted an online survey in Berlin, Germany (n = 627)
   to understand (i) the reasons for cemetery visits; (ii) preferences for
   cemetery features; (iii) the effect of a dead tree as a wilderness
   component on preferences for differently managed green areas (wild,
   meadows, lawns); (iv) preferences of nature elements as comforting
   experiences; and (v) how reasons for the visit and sociodemographic
   variables relate to respondents' preferences. The major reasons to visit
   cemeteries were `enjoying nature', `mourning', and `historical interest'
   and most preferred cemetery features were `wildlife', `solitude', and
   `vegetation'. Presenting a dead tree did not modulate preference ratings
   for green areas that were depicted on photographs. Comforting
   experiences with nature elements were high overall. The reasons to visit
   had besides socio-demographic variables predictive potential on
   pronounced preferences. The results underscore the importance of
   cemeteries as multidimensional places and indicate tolerance for the
   inclusion of dead trees as important wildlife habitat. Strategies to
   develop cemeteries as shared habitats for people and nature should also
   consider, besides socio-demographic background, the reasons for cemetery
   visits.},

Title = {Ultrasonic deterrents reduce nuisance cat (Felis catus) activity
   on suburban properties},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Urban environments are increasingly important for biodiversity
   conservation, but pet cats threaten wildlife therein, displaying
   nuisance behaviour such as hunting, fighting, fouling and urine
   spraying. In an attempt to empower landholders wishing to reduce cat
   incursions humanely, we tested the effectiveness of two ultrasonic cat
   deterrents (CatStop (c) and On-Guard Mega-Sonic Cat Repeller (c)).
   After confirming in arena trials that cats detect and respond negatively
   to an ultrasonic device, we tested both deterrents in 18 suburban
   gardens in Perth, Western Australia. Camera monitoring at foci of cat
   activity (e.g. fish ponds, property entry/exit points) occurred for two
   weeks before (Period 1: device off), during (Period 2: device on) and
   after (Period 3: device off) the activation of deterrents. Data included
   individual cat demographics and behaviours, number of cat detections per
   site per day per sampling period, the duration of cat activity, and
   detection of non-target species.
   Seventy-eight unique cats were detected at 17 of 18 garden sites (2-9
   cats/garden). Over half the cats could be sexed (56.4\%, with 65.1\%
   males). Nearly 53.0\% of cats were confirmed to be pets living nearby.
   Cats that were most active in period 1 (>= 100 s total activity
   duration) were classified as `residents'; all others were `peripherals'.
   Overall, the ultrasonic deterrents reduced the frequency of incursions
   into gardens by resident cats by 46\%, while the duration of incursions
   was reduced by 78\%. Cat activity declined significantly from period 1
   (baseline) to period 2 for resident cats but not peripheral cats (50\%
   reduction; p = 0.001), and remained depressed in period 3 for resident
   cats but not peripheral cats (p < 0.001). Peripheral cat activity
   remained at an unchanging low level across all three periods. Males were
   slightly more active than females over the experiment (p = 0.04), but
   sexes did not vary in response to deterrents (p > 0.05). Cats confirmed
   as owned (53\% of cats) generated more activity than cats of unknown
   ownership status (p = 0.03), probably reflecting proximity of their
   residences to trial gardens. Both deterrent models had similar effects
   (p = 0.89).
   By allowing pets to roam, cat owners are complicit in cat nuisance. This
   requires public education. Ultrasonic deterrents offer a cost-effective,
   humane option to reduce incursions by unwanted cats. Ultrasonic
   deterrents will not prevent all incursions, but they reduce their
   frequency and duration. Reduced cat activity has flow-on benefits to
   wildlife across a variety of urban-suburban settings, including gardens
   and parks. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   placed in separate categories distinguished by green space context
   (parks vs gardens), while very simple and very complex landscapes were
   placed in different categories irrespective of green space context.
   Surprisingly, dense vegetation was highly preferred by respondents. As
   areas of dense vegetation also provide complex habitats for wildlife,

Abstract = {Food availability is a primary driver of avian population regulation.
   However, few studies have considered the effects of what is essentially
   a massive supplementary feeding experiment: the practice of wild bird
   feeding. Bird feeding has been posited as an important factor
   influencing the structure of bird communities, especially in urban
   areas, although experimental evidence to support this is almost entirely
   lacking. We carried out an 18-mo experimental feeding study at 23
   residential properties to investigate the effects of bird feeding on
   local urban avian assemblages. Our feeding regime was based on
   predominant urban feeding practices in our region. We used monthly bird
   surveys to compare avian community composition, species richness, and
   the densities of local species at feeding and nonfeeding properties.
   Avian community structure diverged at feeding properties and five of the
   commonest garden bird species were affected by the experimental feeding
   regime. Introduced birds particularly benefitted, with dramatic
   increases observed in the abundances of house sparrow (Passer
   domesticus) and spotted dove (Streptopelia chinensis) in particular. We
   also found evidence of a negative effect on the abundance of a native
   insectivore, the grey warbler (Gerygone igata). Almost all of the
   observed changes did not persist once feeding had ceased. Our study
   directly demonstrates that the human pastime of bird feeding
   substantially contributes to the structure of avian community in urban
   areas, potentially altering the balance between native and introduced
   species.},

   occupancy in an American midwestern city},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {229},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With future human population growth concentrating in urban areas, cities
   are working to counterbalance ecological disturbances resulting from
   development by incorporating green space that supports greater
   biodiversity. An initial line of inquiry into designing
   wildlife-inclusive green space involves evaluating landscapes that are
   associated with the habitat use of urban species. In this study, we
   utilized occupancy modeling to estimate select terrestrial mammal
   presence in a fast-growing mid-sized midwestern city to determine
   possible taxa-specific associations with multiple land use and cover
   variables, specifically those associated with higher degrees of human
   activity. Using motion-triggered infrared trail cameras over eight
   seasons from winter 2017 to fall 2018, we applied a single-species,
   single -season stacked design to estimate occupancy for eight urban
   dwelling mammals. Taxa-specific models contained one of three possible
   detection variables (null, percent green space, or percent impervious
   surface) and combinations of three species-specific variables, natural
   and anthropogenic. We hypothesized that large species, coyote (Canis
   latrans) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), would exhibit
   the most positive association to natural land cover and the most
   negative association to anthropogenic land cover. We also hypothesized
   that small and medium sized species, eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus
   floridanus), gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), opossum (Didelphis
   virginiana), raccoon (Procyon lotor), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and
   striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), would demonstrate a neutral
   association to land cover type, anthropogenic or natural. Our results
   indicated that the presence of anthropogenic features rather than any
   particular natural land cover may be driving wildlife distribution in
   our study area, as none of our species demonstrated a positive
   association to natural land cover (percent recreation, residential
   yards, vacant land, or woodland). Species with a wide range of body
   sizes, showed a negative association with residential yards, indicating
   that this type of green space may be an unnecessary or unsuitable
   subsidizing resource in our study area. With our results in mind, we
   recommend increasing the amount of natural or less manicured green space
   to offset the intensity of impervious surface as well as encouraging the
   establishment of native vegetation in existing and newly con-structed
   residential development to better connect urban green space and
   residential yards to larger adjoining tracts of natural landscapes. For
   our study area and other cities in similar phases of development, these
   suggestions may be essential first steps to reduce biodiversity loss and
   strengthen community ecology as urban areas continue to grow.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is one of the biggest global threats to biodiversity.
   However, urban areas can offer opportunities for biodiversity
   conservation because of the assortment of resources and numerous taxa
   that occur in these habitats. While the use of gardens by animals is
   well documented, the ability of native fauna to exclusively use (i.e.
   reside in) them is largely uninvestigated and therefore constrains our
   current understanding of their conservation `value'. We aimed to
   determine whether individuals of a threatened species can exclusively
   reside in gardens for several months of their life, and the frequency
   that novel resources (i.e. non-natural) are used compared to natural
   ones. We predicted that individuals captured in gardens would use both
   bushland and residential habitat, and use natural resources more
   frequently than novel resources because of the assumption that remnant
   habitat is more suitable than modified gardens. Using the Critically
   Endangered western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis) as a
   case study, we captured 20 individuals in gardens and radio-tracked them
   for a period of 95 +/- 3.3 days to determine their habitat use. Contrary
   to our predictions, for the duration of our study individuals
   exclusively resided within gardens, irrespective of proximity to
   bushland, and used novel resources more frequently than natural
   resources for all behaviours. We also found that over half (53\%) of all
   the captured female possums had pouch young, and at the conclusion of
   the study, male possums were on average 43 g heavier. Our results
   exemplify that gardens can be of sufficient quality to support
   individuals, and that these modified habitats should be incorporated
   into conservation policy in urban landscapes. Given the extensive number
   of threatened species located within cities globally, our finding that a
   threatened species can reside exclusively within gardens further
   highlights the conservation opportunity that residential landscapes and
   cities offer wildlife.},

   the largest zoo in the country; a total of 421 questionnaires were
   obtained at the zoo over a long weekend. A set of distinct visitor
   motives, visitor experience management factors and interpretation needs
   for the zoo were identified. The research indicates that visitors have
   clear expectations regarding the interpretation offerings at the zoo,
   but that more needs to be done to exceed these expectations. Four
   interpretation factors were the dependent variable in the research and
   the linear regression analyses results revealed which combination of the
   visitor experience factors had the most significant influence on
   enhancing these critical factors. The contributing factors vary,
   depending on the type of interpretation. The challenge for the zoo and
   other captive wildlife establishments is to find a balance between
   attracting visitors (increased visitor satisfaction) while
   simultaneously enhancing edu-cation and conservation management through
   prioritizing interpretation. Management implications: The research
   indicates that visitors have clear expectations regarding the
   interpretation offerings at the zoo, but that more needs to be done to
   exceed these expectations. It appears that visitors to these
   establishments seek a relaxing and fun excursion while expecting their
   interaction to involve getting as close as possible to the wildlife. In
   the process, the critical function of the zoo in terms of education and
   conservation are less prioritized than ?entertaining? visitors. The
   findings of this research is the first step in addressing this pertinent
   issue. This research can help to change the negative perceptions
   surrounding the management of zoos and can provide guidelines on how to
   manage the visitor experience sustainably by emphasizing conservation
   management and education through interpretation.},

Title = {A survey of American residential garden conservation programs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Residential gardens constitute a large percentage of the greenspace in
   urbanized areas. In aggregate, these gardens can provide a significant
   amount of habitat if they are managed with the aim of supporting
   wildlife. Recognizing this, there has been an increase in the number of
   programs that seek to guide homeowners to reform their landscaping
   practices to create habitat within their yard. These programs offer
   certification to participants once they have implemented the suggested
   criteria, which usually consist of installing native plants, providing
   habitat elements, and eliminating practices that degrade habitat. We
   used systematic Google searches to identify 115 such residential garden
   conservation programs in the United States, with the intention of
   determining how they differ or are the same across their aims,
   affiliations, certification criteria, and rigor. Results indicate that
   programs vary greatly across these measures, making collective
   evaluation of programs to advance the field of residential conservation
   difficult. Further, the programs vary in how they connect to enrollees
   and the community through their social media usage, language on yards
   signs that are awarded with certification, and support they provide
   through the certification process. These programs may have the potential
   to engage a substantial number of homeowners and increase urban habitat
   in the process, but at this juncture more investigations into their
   conservation outcomes and their interactions with potential and current
   enrollees are warranted. We follow our analysis with a self-assessment
   for managers to consider as they design and improve their program's
   conservation potential and outreach.},

   identified through the Pediatric Oncology Group and the Children's
   Cancer Group. One age-matched control was identified for each case by
   random digit dialing. Telephone interviews with each parent collected
   information on residential exposure to pesticides, Pesticide use in both
   the home and garden were modestly associated with neuroblastoma {[}odds

   pesticides in children diagnosed after 1 year of age {[}OR = 2.2 (95\%

   mechanism more common for neuroblastomas in older children. There was no
   evidence of differential pesticide effects in subgroups of neuroblastoma
   defined by MYCN oncogene amplification or tumor stage.},

Title = {A national scale inventory of resource provision for biodiversity within

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {142},
Number = {4},
Pages = {761-771},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The human population is increasingly disconnected from nature due to
   urbanisation. To counteract this phenomenon, the UK government has been
   actively promoting wildlife gardening. However, the extent to which such
   activities are conducted and the level of resource provision for
   biodiversity (e.g., food and nesting sites) within domestic gardens
   remains poorly documented. Here we generate estimates for a selection of
   key resources provided within gardens at a national scale, using 12
   survey datasets gathered across the UK. We estimate that 22.7 million
   households (87\% of homes) have access to a garden. Average garden SiZe
   is 190 m(2), extrapolating to a total area of 432,924 ha. Although
   substantial, this coverage is still an order of magnitude less than that
   of statutory protected areas. Approximately 12.6 million (48\%)
   households provide supplementary food for birds, 7.4 million of which
   specifically use bird feeders. Similarly, there are a minimum of 4.7
   million nest boxes within gardens. These figures equate to one bird
   feeder for every nine potentially feeder-using birds in the UK, and at
   least one nest box for every six breeding pairs of cavity nesting birds.
   Gardens also contain 2.5-3.5 million ponds and 28.7 million trees, which
   is just under a quarter of all trees occurring outside woodlands.
   Ongoing urbanisation, characterised by increased housing densities, is
   inevitable throughout the UK and elsewhere. The important contribution
   domestic gardens make to the green space infrastructure in residential
   areas must be acknowledged, as their reduction will impact biodiversity
   conservation, ecosystem services, and the well-being of the human
   population. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the wildlife refuge Pantanos de Villa, habitat preferences of

   of 211 species of birds, of which 97 were residents, 82 migratories and
   32 occasional visitors. According to use of habitats: 80.1\% of species
   live on any of these wetlands, 40.8\% in the marine coast, 37.9\% in

   intensity of the species richness varied according to their occupance
   habitats, with the highest value observed between March and May in the

   the low similarity degree would show species exclusivity of each of

Abstract = {Following the call from the United Nations Convention on Biological

   preserve urban biodiversity, this paper presents stakeholder-specific
   statements for bird conservation in city environments. Based upon the
   current urban bird literature we focus upon habitat fragmentation,
   limited habitat availability, lack of the native vegetation and
   vegetation structure as the most important challenges facing bird
   conservation in cities. We follow with an overview of the stakeholders
   in cities, and identify six main groups having the greatest potential to
   improve bird survival in cities: i) urban planners, urban designers and
   (landscape) architects, ii) urban developers and engineers, iii)
   homeowners and tenants, iv) companies and industries, v) landscaping and
   gardening firms, vi) education professionals. Given that motivation to
   act positively for urban birds is linked to stakeholder-specific advice,
   we present ten statements for bird-friendly cities that are guided by an
   action perspective and argument for each stakeholder group. We conclude
   with a discussion on how the use of stakeholder-specific arguments can
   enhance and rapidly advance urban bird conservation action.},

Abstract = {Across Europe, hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) appear to be in decline
   in both urban and rural landscapes. Current methods used to monitor
   urban populations are, however, associated with several potential
   limitations. In this study, we conducted hedgehog footprint-tunnel
   surveys in 219 residential gardens across Reading, UK between
   May-September in 2013 and/or 2014; gardens were surveyed for five
   continuous days. Single-species occupancy models were used to
   investigate factors influencing hedgehog occupancy and two-species
   occupancy models were used to estimate a species interaction factor
   (SIF) between hedgehogs and (a) badgers (Meles meles), (b) foxes (Vulpes
   vulpes) and (c) dogs (Canis familiaris). The five-day survey protocol
   was associated with a false-absence error rate of 0.1-0.4\%, indicating
   that it was a reliable method for determining hedgehog presence;
   conversely, 34.7\% of householders were not able to correctly predict
   hedgehog presence or absence. Hedgehogs were widely distributed across
   Reading, but detected in only 32-40\% of gardens. None of the
   within-garden or outside-garden factors investigated significantly
   affected hedgehog occupancy in the single-species models, but the
   two-species models indicated that badgers (SIF=0.471 +/- 0.188), but not
   foxes (SIF=0.954 +/- 0.048) or dogs (SIF=0.780 +/- 0.228), negatively
   affected the presence of hedgehogs in gardens, although not
   significantly. Overall, footprint-tunnels represent a viable field
   method for monitoring urban hedgehog populations, however, other
   approaches are required to identify factors that make gardens hedgehog
   friendly.},

Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {151-165},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Human-wildlife interactions are believed to be increasing worldwide, and
   a number of studies have analyzed the risks posed by larger carnivores.
   However, people can also perceive smaller species of carnivores as
   threatening, particularly in urban areas. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes)
   started to colonize British cities in the 1930s, and there is growing
   public concern about foxes biting people, particularly babies. These
   events are generally described in the press as attacks and generate
   intense media coverage and speculation that foxes view human infants as
   potential prey. Because foxes rely primarily on auditory cues for
   hunting, we conducted acoustic playback experiments in the gardens of 15
   residential houses in northwest Bristol, United Kingdom, in December
   2015 and 11 gardens from May to June 2016 to determine whether urban
   foxes were attracted to infant distress calls (cries). Foxes were not
   more likely to be attracted to infant cries or laughs than silence,
   although a minority of foxes cautiously approached and contacted the
   source of both types of infant vocalization. Their behavior appeared to
   be investigative rather than aggressive or predatory. Our review of the
   incidents reported in the British media showed that most people were
   bitten or scratched while sleeping, and adults were more likely to be
   bitten than children. The nature of the interactions and the wounds
   inflicted suggest that the foxes were using their mouth or forefeet to
   investigate an unusual object. Most incidents occurred inside people's
   homes, even though it is unusual for foxes to enter houses. The data
   suggested that incidents where people were bitten were chance events,
   possibly involving a particularly bold fox. To minimize the risk to the
   public, more quantitative data are required on the age, social status,
   and health of the foxes that enter houses and those that bite people.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},
Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {Humans' and elephants' conflict is considered a common phenomenon in
   Bangladesh due to extreme anthropogenic interferences on elephant
   habitats. Concurrently, the landless people were encouraged to encroach
   on forest land due to their financial hardship and poor and weak forest
   management systems. We conducted our research work through frequent
   field visits, site-oriented positioned research correspondents, and an
   adopted semistructured questionnaire. We recorded a total of 903
   conflict-related cases between humans and elephants, including crop
   raids (N = 337), house raids (N = 200), homestead garden raids (N =
   263), and accidental attacks (N = 103), across sites, during August 2018
   to July 2019, in Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary (TWS). Elephant attack rates
   varied significantly between traditional forest dwellers (N = 179),
   illegal settlers (N = 370), villagers nearest forest (N = 212), Rohingya
   refugees (N = 53), and traditional forest different tribes (N = 89). It
   also varied along a space gradient, including inside forests (N = 423),
   buffer zones (N = 297), and outside forest villages (N = 183). The
   number of conflicts possessed by elephants varied discriminately and was
   unparalleled among different professions such as cattle ranchers (N =
   104), gardeners (N = 112), paddy cultivators (N = 236), vegetable
   growers (N = 158), betel-leaf growers (N = 163), and forest resources
   collectors (N = 130). Most conflicts between humans and elephants
   occurred significantly during the night (N = 592), many during the
   morning (N = 154), evening (N = 138), and much less during midday (N =
   19). The conflict intensity was also higher on the east coast (N = 552)
   than on the west coast (N = 351). The seasonal variation, including
   summer (N = 367), monsoon (N = 274), and winter (N = 262), was also
   significant. The elephant herd size was also an important factor
   triggering the conflict in TWS. We conclude that conflict intensity
   between humans and elephants is driven by settlers' location, forest
   gradient, the profession of forest-dependent people, their household
   size and income level, attack time, and season.},

Abstract = {As suburban landscapes expand, it is critical to understand their
   capacity to support wildlife. Pollinators, specifically bees
   (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila), are to some degree compatible with
   urbanization and may be able to exist in suburbs in diverse assemblages.
   We surveyed 21 residential gardens for bees in Westchester County, a
   suburban area immediately north of New York City. From a sample of 1,675
   individuals, we documented 110 species, of which 95\% were native, 50\%
   were solitary, and 93\% were polylectic. In terms of abundance of
   specimens, eusocial (50\% of specimens), native (97\%), and polylectic
   (98\%) bees were dominant. Contrary to our expectation, based on
   previous bee surveys in urban landscapes, the bee community documented
   was not depauperate in either soil-nesting or parasitic species (65 and

   (6\% of species). Instead, the assemblage resembled the richer bee fauna
   documented at a 1,520-ha research preserve (forest) located in the same
   region, although certain specialist (oligolectic) and/or
   forest-associated species were absent. These results suggest that
   suburban landscapes in eastern North America have the potential to host
   relatively diverse and intact bee communities.},

Title = {CLIMAVORE: Divesting from Fish Farms Towards the Tidal Commons},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL \& ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {37},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In Scotland, residents have fought open-net salmon farms and their toll
   on human and nonhuman bodies for decades. This paper recollects seven
   years of work in Skye and Raasay, two islands off the northwest coast of
   the country, developing strategies to divest away from salmon
   aquaculture. Addressing the contemporary wave of underwater clearances
   created by UK's top food export industry, it unpacks the implementation
   of a transition into alternative horizons by embracing the legacies of
   toxicity inherited from salmon extractivist industries. CLIMAVORE, a
   framework developed as a research-led artistic practice by the authors,
   investigates how to eat in the new seasons of the climate crisis. In a
   season of marine dead zones, it facilitates new approaches to
   aquaecology and coastal care that cultivate coastal livelihoods.
   CLIMAVORE began with a new public forum, shaped as a multispecies
   intertidal table, established in Skye in 2017 to envision
   environmentally regenerative and socially reparative forms of food
   production based on metabolic interactions between humans and depleted
   landscapes that benefit a plethora of species. CLIMAVORE's site
   responsive methodology relies on a socially-engaged art practice,
   consisting of fieldwork, interviews, working groups, oral histories,
   performative meals, cooking and building apprenticeships, tidal
   gardening, material testing and public art installations. Ongoing
   collaboration with residents, scientists, and policymakers critically
   explores ways of living not only on but with the coast. This new
   holistic approach to coastal nourishment provides methodologies for
   ecological praxis as well as a platform for researchers and the general
   public to imagine an alternative ecological future: the tidal commons.},

Abstract = {Sustainable landscaping programs are voluntary initiatives that
   recommend a set of practices to improve the environmental quality of
   urban ecosystems by providing landscaping materials, guidelines, and
   educational resources. Our goal was to examine the recommendations and
   outcomes of these programs in the United States and their value for
   encouraging conservation practices in residential ecosystems. We
   conducted a comprehensive web search and identified 193 sustainable
   landscaping programs in the United States. Programs aim to increase
   native species richness, affordably manage stormwater runoff, and offer
   residents meaningful experiences with nature. Sustainable landscaping
   programs present many opportunities to engage people with local
   ecological knowledge and conservation practices, provide accessible
   spaces for environmental education, cultivate interdisciplinary research
   collaborations, and advance inclusion in conservation. However,
   assessments of their ecological value are rare, leaving many questions
   surrounding the benefits to biodiversity and water quality afforded by
   participation. Many programs also require investments in landscaping
   materials and certification fees that might limit participation by some
   households. Future work should examine how recommended practices
   influence urban biodiversity, identify and address barriers to
   participation, and generate social-ecological knowledge that can inform
   future programs.},

Title = {Citizen science reveals widespread supplementary feeding of African
   woolly-necked storks in suburban areas of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {African woolly-necked storks (Ciconia microscelis) depend on wetland
   habitats for foraging and nesting in natural environments. Recently,
   they have started colonising urban environments in KwaZulu-Natal, South
   Africa, and are now a common sight in suburban areas in particular.
   There have been some anecdotal reports on supplementary feeding of this
   species by households in some urban areas where they are common.
   However, these reports have never been confirmed and therefore the
   extent of feeding and lack thereof is unknown. Using a questionnaire
   survey, we therefore investigated the extent (if any) to which
   householders in urban and suburban areas of KwaZulu-Natal provide
   supplementary food to African woolly-necked storks. We also determined
   the feeders' provisioning habits, and identified the motivation behind
   and attitudes toward feeding. We found that a significant number of
   householders fed African woolly-necked storks on a daily basis
   throughout the year. The majority of respondents provided meat while
   others provided inappropriate food such as bread. Respondents were most
   often motivated to feed for personal pleasure. Our results showed that
   this species is successfully utilising and exploiting anthropogenic food
   - a novel behaviour. The observations and narratives from respondents
   strongly suggest that the African woolly-necked stork is present
   throughout the year, contrary to the perception that this species is
   migratory during winter. Based on the results obtained in this study,
   supplementary feeding of African woolly-necked stork by householders is
   relatively common, widespread and established in suburban areas of
   KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. However, reported inappropriate feeding may
   create concerns regarding the health status of African woolly-necked
   storks in urban population. Therefore, to prevent further detrimental
   effects and potential human-wildlife conflicts we recommend that
   suitable feeding guidelines be formulated.},

Abstract = {Early detection of the introduction of alien species is essential for
   effective management and to avoid potential detrimental effects. The
   ocellated skink, Chalcides ocellatus (Forssk??l, 1775), is a known
   invasive species. In April 2017, an introduced free-ranging population
   was found for the first time on the Iberian Peninsula, in Serra del
   Molar (Alicante). In the last two years, new records have appeared in
   areas distinct from the first locality. To assess the actual extent of
   this species??? range, we conducted transects on foot in natural areas
   and held interviews with country house and plant nursery owners in the
   spring and summer of 2020. None of the transects in the natural areas
   found any C. ocellatus, but five confirmed and two probable records were
   obtained during interviews. These new localities were found between 6.3
   and 12.5 km away from the initial locality. At the most distant
   locality, four country houses were surveyed and very high densities of
   C. ocellatus (25 skinks in a backyard of 0.2 ha) were found. The
   respondents agreed that the species started to be sighted around 2017
   and 2018 and it is becoming more frequent with every passing year.
   Although we cannot rule out alternative scenarios, our data about the
   wide extension of the species and the high densities reached suggest a
   phase of rapid population expansion. According to guidelines of the
   allochthonous herpetofauna management in Spain, eradication and active
   management are strongly recommended before detrimental interactions with
   native wildlife, such as the endangered Bedriaga???s skink C. bedriagai
   (Bosc??, 1880) being detected. However, the fossorial behaviour of C.
   ocellatus, and it extending to private areas can make any management
   efforts extremely difficult. Altogether, this case illustrates the key
   role of regulating the horticultural trade to avoid biological
   introductions.},

Abstract = {Urban landscapes present substantial opportunities for biodiversity
   conservation with residential gardens offering some of the greatest
   potential conservation gains given that they represent a significant
   proportion of the total greenspace in urbanised landscapes. However,
   knowledge of wildlife ecology within gardens remains scarce, likely due
   to the difficulties associated with field ecologists accessing privately
   owned areas. Citizen-sourced data presents an alternative approach to
   typical field-based investigations and could be used to develop an
   extensive understanding of biodiversity within privately owned green
   spaces, providing concerns of data unreliability could be overcome. Here
   we i) examine the potential for urban householders to identify a
   threatened nocturnal mammal, in the presence of a similar non-threatened
   species, ii) examine which attributes can predict the level of accuracy
   in householders' species identifications and iii) investigate how their
   self-reported level of certainty affects identification reliability. We
   found up to 80\% agreement between householders and experienced
   ecologists when we assessed presence and absence of nocturnal mammals on
   urban properties. The amount of time a householder had lived at their
   residence was a significant predictor of accuracy for mammal species
   identification, suggesting that familiarity with a site enhances the
   accuracy of citizen science data. Those people with a high level of
   certainty in their ability to correctly identify nocturnal mammals were
   no more likely to show higher species identification accuracy than those
   with low certainty. In urban areas, where ecological surveys for
   nocturnal taxa are especially challenging, our results inspire optimism
   that householders can add to the body of knowledge about biodiversity
   persisting in these landscapes, especially on properties where they have
   resided for at least one year.},

Abstract = {Understanding the factors that influence biodiversity in urban areas is
   important for informing management efforts aimed at enhancing the
   ecosystem services in urban settings and curbing the spread of invasive
   introduced species. We determined the ecological and socioeconomic
   factors that influence patterns of plant richness, phylogenetic
   diversity, and composition in 133 private household yards in the
   Minneapolis-Saint Paul Metropolitan area, Minnesota, USA. We compared
   the composition of spontaneously occurring plant species and those
   planted by homeowners with composition in natural areas (at the Cedar
   Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve) and in the horticulture pool of species
   available from commercial growers. Yard area and fertilizer frequency
   influenced species richness of the spontaneous species but expressed
   homeowner values did not. In contrast, the criteria that homeowners
   articulated as important in their management decisions, including
   aesthetics, wildlife, neatness and food provision, significantly
   predicted cultivated species richness. Strikingly, the composition of
   plant species that people cultivated in their yards resembled the
   taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of species available
   commercially. In contrast, the taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of
   spontaneous species showed high similarity to natural areas. The large
   fraction of introduced species that homeowners planted was a likely
   consequence of what was available for them to purchase. The study links
   the composition and diversity of yard flora to their natural and
   anthropogenic sources and sheds light on the human factors and values
   that influence the plant diversity in residential areas of a major urban
   system. Enhanced understanding of the influences of the sources of
   plants, both native and introduced, that enter urban systems and the
   human factors and values that influence their diversity is critical to
   identifying the levers to manage urban biodiversity and ecosystem

   one-third of the total people of the area consider elephants as enemies,
   and do not vouch for their conservation. An immediate conservation
   initiative is suggested to conserve Asiatic elephants of this region.},

Abstract = {As global populations grow, cities are stretching their urban boundaries

   community attitudes towards planned management interventions in a new
   conservation strategy designed to protect endangered Southern Brown
   Bandicoots in new residential estates around Cranbourne, Australia. A
   survey (n=318, response rate 15.2 per cent) investigated current
   resident attitudes towards bandicoot conservation, cat ownership and
   effectiveness of current planning controls. Results indicate community
   support for a range of bandicoot conservation actions including
   confinement of domestic cats and non-lethal cat controls and for new
   developments being cat-free with bandicoot habitat corridors. Awareness
   of bandicoots correlated with higher support for conservation actions
   while cat owners were less supportive overall, particularly to
   limitations on cat ownership. Potential barriers to management
   interventions include inadequate knowledge, perceived associated risks
   and housing turnover. This information is valuable for conservation

   (Erinaceus europaeus) is influenced by nest box placement,
   resource provisioning and site-based factors},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Artificial refuges provided by householders and/or conservation
   practitioners potentially represent one mechanism for mitigating
   declines in the availability of natural nest sites used for resting,
   breeding and hibernating in urban areas. The effectiveness of such
   refuges for different species is, however, not always known. In this
   study, we conducted a questionnaire survey of UK householders to
   identify factors associated with the use of ground-level nest boxes for
   West European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), a species of conservation
   concern. Overall, the percentage of boxes used at least once varied with
   season and type of use: summer day nesting (35.5-81.3\%), breeding (7.2-
   28.2\%), winter day nesting (20.1-66.5\%) and hibernation (21.7-58.6\%).
   The length of time the box had been deployed, the availability of
   artificial food and front garden to back garden access significantly
   increased the likelihood that a nest box had been used for all four
   nesting types, whereas other factors related to placement within the
   garden (e.g., in a sheltered location, on hardstanding such as paving,
   distance from the house) and resource provisioning (bedding) affected
   only some nesting behaviours. The factors most strongly associated with
   nest box use were the provisioning of food and bedding. These data
   suggest, therefore, that householders can adopt simple practices to
   increase the likelihood of their nest box being used. However, one
   significant limitation evident within these data is that, for welfare
   reasons, householders do not routinely monitor whether their box has
   been used. Consequently, future studies need to adopt strategies which
   enable householders to monitor their boxes continuously. Ultimately,
   such studies should compare the survival rates and reproductive success
   of hedgehogs within artificial refuges versus more natural nest sites,
   and whether these are affected by, for example, the impact of nest box
   design and placement on predation risk and internal microclimate.},

Title = {Growing Biodiverse Urban Futures: Renaturalization and Rewilding as
   Strategies to Strengthen Urban Resilience},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {How are our cities using nature-based solutions to confront the
   challenges posed by a warming climate, the loss of biodiversity and
   major resource depletion? This article discusses the opportunities and
   benefits of applying the concepts of regreening and rewilding of cities.
   The article engages with key sources and summarizes the background and
   development of regreening and nature-based solutions and important
   policies, concerns and perspectives of international and national
   organizations. It introduces the integration of nature-based solutions
   (NBS) as a strategy in urban planning with the aim to strengthen urban
   resilience and to slow down the biodiversity decline. Rewilding areas in
   cities has become a powerful strategy to bring back butterflies,
   insects, birds, and wildlife. In contrast to highly managed parks and
   gardens, these rewilding initiatives are leaving allotted spaces mostly
   uncultivated and self-regulated. Contact to nature is essential for
   human existence, urban wellbeing, and good quality of life. Green spaces
   in cities-big or small-all contribute to the health and wellbeing of
   residents. However, many cities do not offer residents easy access to
   green space within the city. Improving the better distribution of and
   access to green spaces and extending gardens and parks is likely to
   deliver a large number of benefits, such as: ecosystem services, better
   water management for enhanced urban flood control, slowing down the
   biodiversity loss, contributing to food security, and restoring damaged
   ecosystems. Furthermore, additional green space and NBS help to keep
   cities cool during heatwaves and improve the urban microclimate.
   Rewilding has emerged as an important part of new public parks and
   gardens. The next step is to up-scale citywide climate intervention
   strategies deployed to keep cities cool. However, as the discussion of
   this article shows, it is essential that the design of these NBS
   strategies is fully integrated with other complementary planning
   interventions and seeks synergies across all sectors.},

Title = {Wild bird feeding in an urban area: intensity, economics and numbers of

Journal = {ACTA ORNITHOLOGICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-58},

Abstract = {Feeding wild bird is popular in domestic gardens across the world, with
   around half of households in the UK, North America and Australia doing
   so. Nevertheless, there is surprisingly little empirical information on
   many aspects of the activity. We sought to characterise garden bird
   feeding in a large UK urban area in two ways. First, we conducted
   face-to-face questionnaires with a representative cross-section of
   residents. Just over half fed birds, the majority doing so year-round
   and at least weekly. Second, a 2-year, longitudinal study recorded all
   foodstuffs put out by households on every provisioning occasion. In this
   way, we obtained the first year-round quantitative records of the
   amounts and types of wild bird food provided in individual gardens. A
   median of 127 g, equivalent to 628 kcal, was given daily per household
   (typically consisting of several food types). We estimated the daily
   cost of this provisioning level to be UK 0.35 pound per household based
   on the relative proportions of each food type. Provisioning level was
   not significantly influenced by weather or season. Comparisons between
   the data sets revealed significantly less frequent feeding amongst the
   feeders in the longitudinal study (assumed to be `keen' feeders owing to
   their participation in this long-term study and numbers of food types
   provided) than the face-to-face questionnaire respondents, suggesting
   that questionnaires relying upon participants' estimates rather than
   records of provisioning may overestimate actual provisioning frequency.
   Assuming 100\% uptake, the median provisioning level equates to
   sufficient supplementary resources across the UK to fully support 196
   million individuals of a hypothetical average garden-feeding bird
   species (based on 10 common UK garden-feeding birds' energy
   requirements). This compares with an estimated total of 71 million
   breeding individuals of these 10 species in the UK (non-breeding numbers
   unknown). Taking the lowest provisioning level recorded (101 kcal/day)
   as a conservative measure, 31 million of these average individuals could
   theoretically be supported.},

   Policy Setting for Urban Greening in Perth, Western Australia},
Journal = {URBAN SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are regarded as
   the key policy agenda for national, regional, and local government to
   combat climate change impacts and promote sustainable development. For
   example, in Perth and Peel metropolitan area, the capital city of
   Western Australia, there has been a shift of policy setting from that of
   a sprawling city to a denser city, while maintaining and promoting its
   ecosystem services and achieving sustainable city goals. Residential
   verge gardens have been widely adopted in recent years by communities
   and local governments in the Perth metropolitan area. This study reviews
   the motivations and drivers for the uptake of verge gardens in
   metropolitan suburbs and identifies potential policy responses. The City
   of Bayswater local government area was surveyed for this research. The
   study considers a mixed-methods approach, including site auditing and a
   questionnaire survey for local residents who have transformed their
   verges. A total of 534 verge gardens were audited on residential lots,
   and 166 valid questionnaire responses were received from residents. The
   site-audit of the verge gardens in Bayswater found that native
   vegetation is the dominant verge garden of choice, followed by the
   ornamental garden, with food production (plants/vegetables) seeming to
   be the least popular option. Regarding the motivations and drivers, the
   study has found that social (e.g., aesthetics, flowers, social
   interactions, and social mimicry), environmental (e.g., attracting
   wildlife and birds and environmental practice waterwise garden), and
   personal (easy maintenance) drivers are the primary motivators for
   residents to adopt verge gardens. Whilst the on-ground surveys were
   prior to COVID-19, the article includes how this topic could relate to
   pandemic-resilient urban spaces. As local governments look towards
   supporting the sustainable outcome goals, the observations of this study
   will be helpful for developing local government policy and community
   programs in the promotion and uptake of verge gardens in Australian
   cities.},

Abstract = {I walk fantastically with the cows along the stock route of the former

   as a closed story of the past `as it was', which projects a set of
   sanitised meanings that allow for neither subtext nor counter readings.
   I problematise the concrete machine of heritage protection utilising
   Deleuze and Guattari's ideas of faciality, where reassuring mosaic faces
   of cows going to the saleyards belong, but anguished faces of cows at
   the slaughterhouse do not. I call upon the cow's face as potential probe
   head to forge connections between past-present-future in hot heritage
   practices which challenge people to question their values and actions.
   Rediscovery of the cow beneath the face at Newmarket saleyards and
   abattoirs could intervene in people's habitual patterns of thinking and
   acting, triggering renegotiation of cultural meanings of ethics,
   welfare, and rights, regarding not only nonhuman animals, but also
   Othered humans, such as those penned in detention centres. Through

Abstract = {The combination of increasing numbers of people in cities, coupled with
   decreasing levels of biodiversity, is hypothesised to result in the
   extinction of experience, or the continued disintegration of the human
   relationship with the natural world. We use the concepts of sense of
   place and dwelling to investigate the human relationship with nature in
   cities by considering the emotional connections between people and
   places. We conducted `goalong' interviews with 21 residents of Hamilton,
   New Zealand, to explore the significance of neighbourhood parks and home
   gardens in the lives of urban residents. Our study highlights the
   importance of greenspaces in cities to the physical, mental and social
   health of local residents. Bush parks provided the best opportunities
   for respondents to observe nature and thereby escape the stress of city
   life. Participants wanted a variety of parks which would meet the range
   of their community's needs and provide habitat for wildlife. Proximity
   and frequent use of parks resulted in a sense of ownership and
   responsibility which led to concrete action, such as participation in
   ecological restoration of valued greenspaces. Providing high quality
   natural greenspaces within walking distance of residents' homes disrupts
   the extinction of experience by fostering positive personal experiences

Abstract = {Objectives. We examined associations between specific public open space
   (POS) attributes and recreational walking to local POS.
   Methods. Between October 2004 and December 2006, 1465 adults of the
   RESIDential Environments Project, conducted in Perth, Australia,
   reported whether they walk to a POS for recreation. For each
   participant, we identified all open spaces larger than 0.8 hectares
   within 1.6 kilometers from home. On the basis of field audit data, we
   created 3 scores (presence, count, size-weighted presence) for 19
   specific open space attributes.
   Results. With logistic regression analyses, we found that walking to a
   POS was associated with the presence of gardens, grassed areas, walking
   paths, water features, wildlife, amenities, dog-related facilities, and
   off-leash areas for dogs. It was also associated with the highest number
   of these attributes in a single open space, but not with the total
   number of attributes in all POSs within 1.6 kilometers of home.
   Conclusions. Building 1 high-quality local park may be more effective in
   promoting recreational walking than is providing many average-quality
   parks.},

Abstract = {Wild carnivores are becoming increasing common in urban areas. In

   planning. From GPS tracking data, the nine dingoes, predominately
   juvenile and female, we tracked lived within 700 m of residential homes
   at all times and frequently crossed roads, visited backyards and
   traversed built-up areas. Home range sizes ranged between 0.37 km(2) and
   100.32 km(2). Dingoes were mostly nocturnal, averaging 591 m/h between
   dusk and dawn. Juvenile and adult dingoes spent up to 19\% and 72\% of
   their time in urban habitats. Fresh scats from most areas surveyed
   tested positive to a variety of common zoonoses. These data suggest
   dingoes are capable of exploiting pen-urban areas and might contribute

   sites have independently converged on a common adaptive mechanism,
   despite variation in contaminant profiles among sites. These populations
   are united by a similarly profound desensitization of aryl-hydrocarbon
   receptor-mediated transcriptional activation, which is associated with
   extreme tolerance to the lethal effects of toxic dioxin-like pollutants.
   The rapid, repeated, heritable and convergent nature of evolved

Title = {Impact of COVID-19 in the forestry sector: A case of lowland region of
   Nepal},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {120},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {All walks of life have been affected by COVID-19 but smallholders from
   developing countries have been impacted more than others as they are
   heavily reliant on forest and agriculture for their livelihoods and have
   limited capacity to deal with COVID-19. Scholars are heavily engaged in
   assessing the impacts of COVID-19 on health and wellbeing, gender, food
   production and supply, stock market and the overall economy but not on
   the forestry sector. Using questionnaire surveys and key informant
   interviews-informed by grey literature and published articles-
   representing Division Forest Offices, Provincial Forest Directorates,
   and the Ministry of Forests and Environment in Nepal, this study
   assessed the impact of COVID-19 on the forestry sector of Nepal. Our
   analysis suggests that: (1) nature-based tourism is more severely
   affected than other sectors; (2) private, religious and leasehold
   forests faced minimal impacts of COVID-19 than that of community and
   government-managed forests; (3) wild boar (Sus scrofa), different
   species of deer, and birds have been more impacted than other wild
   animals; (4) the price of the timber has increased significantly whereas
   the price of non-timber forests products (NTFPs) has decreased; and (5)
   illegal logging and poaching have increased but the incidence of forest
   encroachment has been reduced. Our study further reveals that
   agroforestry practices in home gardens, borrowing money from
   neighbors/banks/landlords and liquidating livestock remained key
   alternatives for smallholders during COVID19. Many studies reported that
   reverse migration could create chaos in Nepal, but our study suggests
   that it may enhance rural innovation and productivity, as returnees may
   use their acquired knowledge and skills to develop new opportunities. As
   COVID-19 has created a war-like situation worldwide, Nepal should come
   up with a forward-looking fiscal response with alternative income
   generation packages to local living to counter the impacts of COVID-19
   on the forestry sector. One of the options could be implementing similar
   programs to that of India's US\$ 800 Compensatory Afforestation Program
   and Pakistan's 10 Billion Tree Tsunami Program, which will create a
   win-win situation, i.e., generate employment for reverse migrants and
   promotes forest restoration.},

Title = {Fascination and Joy: Emotions Predict Urban Gardeners' Pro-Pollinator
   Behaviour},
Journal = {INSECTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Simple Summary The protection of pollinating insects depends on public
   support. Citizen science (CS) is frequently discussed as a way to
   promote interest and conservation action for pollinators. In cities, the
   drivers behind pollinator-friendly behaviour are largely unclear. We
   surveyed 111 community gardeners in Berlin and Munich, Germany, some of
   which were participating in a citizen science project. We created four
   different sets of generalized linear models to analyse how the
   gardeners' pro-pollinator behaviour intentions and behaviour were
   explained by the gardener's identity, emotions towards pollinators,
   attitudes towards pollinators and nature-relatedness. Respondents who
   were fascinated by pollinators, held positive attitudes, and felt joy
   about seeing pollinators reported intentions to protect or support
   pollinators. Similarly, joy about seeing pollinators was a predictor of
   participation in the CS project. We believe that CS may represent a
   pathway through which urban residents may become key actors in
   conservation projects within their nearby greenspaces. The conservation
   of pollinators requires social understanding to catalyse restoration
   action. Citizen science (CS) is discussed as a way to promote interest
   and action for pollinating insects. Yet, the drivers behind
   pro-pollinator behaviour are largely unclear, especially in urban areas.
   To better understand public engagement in pollinator conservation, we
   studied urban community gardeners' identity, nature-relatedness,
   emotions, and attitudes toward pollinators and their intentions to get
   involved in pro-pollinator behaviour in their gardening practice. We
   surveyed community gardeners in Berlin and Munich, Germany, some of
   which were participating in a citizen science project. In this
   scientific study, we created four different sets of generalized linear
   models to analyse how the gardeners' pro-pollinator behaviour intentions
   and behaviour were explained by socio-psychological factors. The
   responses of 111 gardeners revealed that gardeners that were fascinated
   by pollinators, held positive attitudes and felt joy about seeing
   pollinators reported intentions to protect or support pollinators,
   suggesting that fascination and joy can be harnessed for research and
   conservation on pollinators. Similarly, joy about seeing pollinators
   predicted participation in the CS project. We believe that CS may
   represent a pathway through which urban residents may become key actors
   in conservation projects within their nearby greenspaces.},

Title = {Moles and Mole Control on British Farms, Amenities and Gardens after
   Strychnine Withdrawal},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary: Moles are burrowing mammals that are regarded as pests
   in Britain, and until 2006 they could legally be killed using strychnine
   poison. When strychnine was withdrawn there were fears that mole
   populations would increase. We surveyed farmers, amenity managers and
   householders about moles and mole control on their land in 2007, post
   strychnine withdrawal. Kill-trapping was by far the preferred control
   method used and control may be used more than can be justified by damage
   levels or the effect of control on damage. Mole traps are unregulated,
   unlike most other spring traps, and some might not meet current welfare
   standards. We found no evidence that mole activity had increased since a
   1992 survey of farms.
   Abstract: Moles are considered pests in Britain, but this issue has been
   little studied. Lower welfare standards have been tolerated for moles
   than for most other managed wild mammal species, as use of both the
   controversial poison, strychnine, and unregulated traps have been
   permitted. Strychnine was withdrawn in 2006 and there were fears that
   mole populations would increase as a result. In 2007, we conducted a
   comprehensive, nationwide survey of land manager perceptions, opinions
   and behaviour regarding moles and mole control on farms, amenities and
   domestic gardens in Britain. We surveyed 2150 land managers (achieving a
   59\% response rate) and ground-truthed 29 responses. Moles were reported
   to be present on most farms and amenities, and 13\% of gardens, and were
   more common in lighter soils. Where present, moles were usually
   considered pests, this being more likely in Wales, Scotland and northern
   England, on livestock and mixed farms, and on large, high-value
   amenities, e.g., racecourses and golf courses. Mole control followed
   similar patterns to mole presence. More control may occur than is
   economically, and therefore potentially ethically, justified. Control
   should be more carefully considered and, where necessary, more
   effectively targeted. Kill-trapping was the favoured recent and future
   method on farms and amenities, even if strychnine was to be
   reintroduced; however, because mole traps are currently unregulated,
   some might not meet current welfare standards if tested. We found no
   evidence for an increase in moles since a farm questionnaire survey
   conducted in 1992; this could have wider implications for future
   wildlife management policy changes.},

Abstract = {The contribution to urban green space by private or domestic gardens in
   residential zones was investigated in the city of Sheffield, UK, as part
   of a wider study of the garden resource and its associated biodiversity.
   The attributes of 61 gardens, including patterns of landcover and
   vegetation cover, were explored in relation to housing characteristics
   and the nature of the surrounding landscape. The number of surrounding
   houses, and the areas of buildings and of roads were negatively
   correlated with garden area. The proportion of a housing parcel
   comprising garden increased with parcel size, although the proportion
   that was rear garden remained relatively constant. Garden size played an
   overwhelming role in determining garden composition: larger gardens
   supported more landcovers, contained greater extents of three-quarters
   of the recorded landcovers, and were more likely to contain trees taller
   than 2 m, vegetable patches, and composting sites. Unvegetated
   landcovers made greater proportional contributions as garden size
   declined. All categories of vegetation canopy increased with garden
   size, and large gardens supported disproportionately greater cover above
   3 m. House age was a less significant factor determining garden
   landcover. Gardens of newer houses were more likely to occur towards the
   edge of the urban area, and older properties, that contained fewer
   hedges, possessed less canopy between 2-3 m. The extent and occurrence
   of different landcovers in gardens, and their consequences for wildlife,
   are considered for residential patches in urban areas. The implications
   for urban planners are discussed.},

Title = {Citizen Science Helps Uncover the Secrets to a Bat-Friendly Swimming
   Pool in an Urban Environment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {For urban environments to support bat communities, resources need to be
   readily available. For example, bats typically use urban water sources
   such as drainage ditches and ponds; however, these sources can be
   ephemeral. During these periods, bats have utilized residential swimming
   pools, although they only appear to drink at pools when access to more
   natural equivalents are limited. This posed the question ``can we make
   residential swimming pools friendlier for a diversity of bat
   species?{''} Using citizen science to determine which pool
   characteristics influenced bat activity, we distributed a questionnaire
   to residents in a suburban neighborhood in Fort Worth, TX, United
   States. It focused on observations of bat activity and the features of
   the pools and immediate surroundings. We distributed the questionnaire
   through social media, local presentations, and by mail throughout 2019
   and 2020. We then used classification trees to determine which
   characteristics in combination influenced bat activity at the pools. We
   generated three different trees for bats observed (1) flying around the
   property and backyard, (2) above the swimming pool, and (3) drinking at
   the pool. We found that more bats were observed at unlit pools without
   bush or shrub borders. Furthermore, among pools with borders, activity
   was lowest at pools with textured interiors and >= 6 trees visible. The
   presence of features, such as fountains, then contributed to a reduction
   in bat observations in backyards and the presence of pets appeared to
   further reduce activity specifically over the pools. Where bats were
   observed drinking, this activity was reported the least at pools with
   bush or shrub borders, textured interiors, and trees 10 m from the edge
   of the pools. Our study revealed that certain characteristics of
   residential swimming pools encouraged bat activity, while others
   discouraged them. Thus, it may be possible to make swimming pools more
   bat-friendly. For example, turning lights off in the evening when
   backyards are not in use and reducing clutter around pools could have an
   immediate positive impact on local bat populations. The implementation
   of such recommendations could improve urban habitats for bats overall
   and alleviate some of the negative implications of continued
   urbanization.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The burgeoning application of fertilizers and pesticides to residential
   lawns, which has begun to offset the gains made in reducing the use of
   chemicals in agriculture, represents a serious environmental hazard in
   the United States and elsewhere. Increased use and purchase occur
   specifically among a sector of consumers who explicitly and
   disproportionately acknowledge the risks associated with chemical
   deposition, moreover, and who express concern about the quality of water
   and human health. What drives the production of monocultural lawns in a
   period when environmental consciousness has encouraged ``green{''}
   household action (e.g., recycling)? And why does the production of
   chemical externalities occur among individuals who claim to be concerned
   about community, family, and environment? In this article, we explore
   the interactions that condition and characterize the growth of intensive
   residential yard management in the United States. We argue that the
   peculiar growth and expansion of the moral economy of the lawn is the
   product of a threefold process in which (1) the lawn-chemical industry
   has implemented new and innovative styles of marketing that (2) help to
   produce an association of community, family, and environmental health
   with intensive turf-grass aesthetics and (3) reflect an increasing local
   demand by consumers for authentic experiences of community, family, and
   connection to the nonhuman biological world through meaningful work.},

Title = {Factors affecting hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) attraction to
   rural villages in arable landscapes},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {63},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although residential areas are often unfavourable for wildlife, some
   species can take advantage of the available shelter and anthropogenic
   sources of food such as supplementary feeding. The European hedgehog
   (Erinaceus europaeus) is increasingly associated with gardens and
   villages and less so with arable farmland. Suggested drivers for this
   include the following: hedgehogs' attraction to higher food densities,
   including natural prey and anthropogenic sources, a greater range of day
   nest sites and warmer microclimates in rural villages, coupled with
   decreased risk of predation by badgers (Meles meles). We investigated
   the contribution of these drivers by radio-tracking hedgehogs on four
   arable sites, two with badgers present. Seventy-eight hedgehogs were
   tracked, 32 yielding enough data to calculate home range sizes. At the
   home range and landscape scales, gardens and buildings were the highest
   ranked habitats compared with their availability. Woodland and arable
   land were the lowest ranked compared with their availability. Villages
   were the most selected habitat for nesting. When hedgehogs were found
   closer to buildings, their ranges were smaller and we speculate this is
   due to increased food availability in villages. Where badgers were
   present hedgehogs remained closer to cover and their home ranges were on
   average 12.2 ha smaller. On badger-occupied sites, 50\% fewer
   radio-tracking fixes were on arable land. We conclude that resource
   availability coupled with nest site selection and badger presence drives
   hedgehogs' selection of rural villages. We found no effect of ambient
   temperature on habitat use. We recommend focusing conservation efforts
   on maintaining hedgehog populations in rural villages.},

Abstract = {Indigenous belief systems and informal institutions that result in the

   conservation. The erosion of cultural beliefs and practices can have
   adverse, often severe, consequences for biodiversity. We explored the
   relationships among informal institutions, religion, and human attitudes
   toward sacred populations of a threatened, endemic species, Sclater's
   monkey (Cercopithecus sclateri), in two communities in southeastern
   Nigeria. Due to habitat loss and hunting pressure across the species'
   range, monkeys in these two sites live alongside people, raid farms and
   gardens, and are commonly viewed as pests. Using structured (n = 410)
   and semi-structured (n = 21) interviews, we examined factors influencing
   residents' views of the monkeys, mechanisms affecting adherence to
   social taboos against harming monkeys, and implications for
   conservation. Our analyses revealed that most residents, particularly
   those from one community, women, and farmers, held negative opinions of
   the monkeys. Crop and garden raiding by monkeys had the most adverse
   effect on people's attitudes. Although the adoption of Christianity
   weakened residents' views regarding the no-killing taboos, continued
   adherence to the taboos was particularly influenced by supernatural
   retribution in one site and community disapproval in the other. Only one
   community widely conferred symbolic importance on the monkeys. Such site
   differences illustrate the value of local cultural understanding in
   conservation. Pre-intervention studies of this nature allow for the
   development of locally and culturally sensitive conservation programs,
   as well as better-informed assessments of what interventions are most
   likely to be effective.},

Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {81},
Number = {2},
Pages = {361-365},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Supplementary feeding of wild birds during winter is one of the most
   popular wildlife management activities, and is likely to have profound
   influence on the behavioural ecology of a species. At garden bird
   feeders, birds are now often fed well into the breeding season.
   Providing food within an established songbird territory, however, is
   likely to influence the territorial behaviour of the resident male. We
   used song performance during the dawn chorus in early spring to study
   behavioural changes in food-supplemented great tits, Parus major. After
   2 weeks of continuous food supply within their territory, supplemented
   males started dawn singing later than control males, and thus postponed
   their regular dawn chorus before sunrise. This effect was maintained 2
   weeks after food supplementation had ended. However, we did not find an
   effect of long-term feeding on song output. Our results were largely
   unexpected because formal models and field studies on short-term food
   supplementation suggested an earlier start of dawn singing or a higher
   dawn song output. Because we did not observe great tits visiting the
   feeders before sunrise or food supplementation increasing the numbers of
   conspecific intruders, the reasons for the delay in the start of dawn
   singing remain unclear; possible explanations include the presence of
   predators at feeding stations and the quality of the supplementary food
   itself. Delaying dawn singing could potentially affect the reproductive
   success of supplemented males, for example if females base extrapair
   mating decisions on dawn song performance of their mates. (C) 2010 The

   interviews with the eight stakeholder managers involved to identify key
   factors impacting on the perceived feasibility of future urban meadow
   establishment in other areas. All managers identified three dominant
   factors (aesthetics and public reaction, locational context, and human
   resources and economic sustainability). Additional factors (local
   politics, communication, biodiversity and existing habitat and physical
   factors) varied in importance according to personal values and
   managerial role. Support for future meadow introduction and a desire to
   overcome the economic challenge of the disposal of meadow arisings were
   related to manager biocentricity. Managers were aware of changing public
   values leading to increasing acceptance of a messier urban aesthetic.
   They perceived perennial meadows as a realistic alternative to amenity

Abstract = {Very little little is known about how lizards respond to urbanization.
   Given their small space requirements, opportunist lizard species can
   potentially exist in small patches of suitable urban habitat. This study
   identified the relative importance of landscape and habitat-level
   factors that influenced the occurrence of an opportunist and generally
   abundant species, the common skink Oligosoma nigriplantare polychrome in
   suburban private gardens in New Zealand. Private gardens are potentially
   important in sustaining urban wildlife as they make up a significant
   proportion of the total area of many cities. Common skinks were largely
   absent from the central suburbs and distributed in less highly ordered
   gardens around the city edge. Skink occurrence was influenced mainly by
   landscape-level features that reflect opportunities for dispersal into
   gardens from source populations (distance to city edge; presence of an
   adjacent grassy paddock) and habitat quality (messiness). To a lesser
   extent skink occurrence was associated with lower cat densities, less
   native vegetation and south-facing sites. Within private gardens common
   skinks were associated with areas with a high proportion of basking
   surfaces, lower plant species diversity, shorter distances to potential
   cover, and vegetation that was low in height and made up mainly of long
   exotic grasses. Despite common skinks' ability to thrive in exotic
   vegetation and their small spatial requirements, it is unlikely that
   they will thrive in urban areas unless gardening practices change to
   increase resource availability and provide refuges from predators. (C)

Abstract = {As urbanization increases, the identification of nest predators becomes

   communities. We investigated bird nest predation using artificial nests
   in urban areas of the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province of South Africa. From
   June 2013 through February 2014 we installed seventy-five artificial
   nests in 25 suburban gardens in the Ethekwini and Msunduzi
   municipalities of KZN. Euplectes spp. nests were used and baited with
   two quail-sized, hand-made, silicon eggs. These were placed in
   residential gardens and monitored by camera traps for 2-weeks in winter,
   spring and summer respectively. Generally bird nesting occurs throughout
   the year in KZN's subtropical climate, with some avoidance during the
   autumn season. Therefore, experiments were not conducted during autumn,
   as fresh nests were not available for use. Overall the rate of predation
   on artificial nests was 25 \% (n = 19), with vervet monkeys Ceropithecus
   aethiops pygerythrus predating 20 \% (n = 17) of the nests while
   domestic cats Felis catus predated 3 \% (n = 2) of nests. Nest predation
   was significantly higher in the winter season, with 79 \% of
   depredations occurring in winter (n = 15), 16 \% in spring (n = 3) and 5
   \% in summer (n = 1), and in areas with less canopy cover. Our results

   ecosystem disservices (ED) and how such spaces deliver urban ecosystem
   services (UES). However, a gap exists in understanding how ES and ED
   manifest themselves in the more specific context of residential
   yardscapes. Specifically, do homeowners conceptualize ES and ED when
   talking about their yards without specific prompts to reflect services
   and disservices? The current work presents a case study of homeowners in
   the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota, United States.
   We used two associated surveys to elicit responses related to
   homeowners' yards. Without prompting, homeowner conceptualizations of
   their yardscapes reflected all ES categories with cultural (CES) (e.g.,
   family recreation) and provisioning (PES) (e.g., vegetable cultivation)
   services cited most often. Homeowners also mentioned ED associated with
   their own or a neighbor's yard (e.g., attraction of nuisance wildlife).
   Their plans for yardscapes indicated largely incremental changes (e.g.,
   putting in a new planting bed) vs. drastic shifts (e.g., complete
   replacement of turfgrass with alternative vegetation). This case study
   illustrates that the homeowners' conceptualizations of their yards do
   indeed reflect current ES \& ED frameworks without specific prompting.
   The ES framework, combined with the identified leverage points, can be a
   fruitful approach for enhancing UES and minimizing ED within residential
   yardscapes.},

Abstract = {Little is known of the motives of residents for planting and removing
   garden trees in Western cities and nothing is known of the motives
   related to planting and removing different types of trees. We test the
   hypotheses that attitudes towards trees are reflected in the planting
   and removal of trees in general and of different types of urban trees,
   and that attitude syndromes are related to socioeconomic, demographic
   and spatial characteristics. A questionnaire asked for information on
   motives for planting and removing trees in general, and on actual
   planting and removal of trees in the last five years. Responses to
   questions about motives, to other questions on the values and problems
   of trees, and to a photo-elicitation section were numerically classified
   to derive seven classes of residents: aesthetes; spiritual tree lovers;
   practical tree lovers; arboriphobes: native wildlife lovers; tree hazard
   minimisers; and indifferents. Membership of classes was influenced by
   income, tertiary education and gender, but not age, negative experiences
   of trees or ownership status, indicating that attitudes may be
   relatively durable and not easily amenable to change. Attitudes tended
   to be expressed in actions. Variation between attitude groups in the
   types of trees they prefer combined with turnover of property ownership
   may be responsible for a lack of old urban trees. Urban planners and
   land managers interested in influencing resident decisions about private
   trees need to address variation in attitudes between different segments
   of the population. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Willingness of rural and urban citizens to undertake pollinator
   conservation actions across three contrasting European countries},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},

Volume = {6},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Over the last two decades, ecological and conservation studies on
   pollinator insects have increased significantly. However, scientific
   evidence alone is not enough to translate knowledge into policy and into
   changes in behaviour. To reduce the gap between scientific knowledge on
   conservation actions and their actual uptake, one should understand the
   socio-psychological drivers of people's willingness to undertake these
   actions. Here, we investigated the socio-psychological factors
   influencing individual behaviour in favour of conservation interventions
   for pollinators in rural versus urban environments across three European
   countries: Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. We administered an online
   questionnaire to 4541 respondents stratified by nationality,
   environment, age and gender. Despite regional differences in
   socio-cultural and economic conditions, individuals from Germany, Italy
   and the Netherlands living in both rural or urban environments shared
   similar socio-psychological drivers to protect pollinators. People
   intended to take action to protect pollinators when they felt morally
   obliged to, when their social environment supported pollinator
   protection, when they believed their individual behaviour had an impact,
   and when they engaged frequently in outdoor activities. Interestingly,
   specific values held towards pollinators, such as their right to exist,
   seemed much more important predictors of activating norms that promote
   conservation actions compared to increasing general environmental
   concern. In all countries, among the conservation actions, the most
   likely to be implemented was planting flowers, while one of the most
   unlikely was participating in monitoring activities. Synthesis and
   applications. People from three contrasting European countries living in
   both rural and urban landscapes were mostly driven by the same
   socio-psychological factors to help pollinator insects. Therefore, our
   results offer several practical recommendations to promote pollinator
   conservation across Europe. First, conservation practitioners interested
   in pollinator conservation should pay greater attention to values
   specific to pollinators, as they seemed more important behaviour
   predictors than general care for the environment. Second, engaging
   people in conservation efforts can be accomplished by increasing
   awareness about the vital roles that pollinators play within ecosystems.
   Lastly, promoting simple nature-based activities such as wildlife
   observation, and gardening can help foster a sense of connection to and
   appreciation for pollinators and pollination.Read the free Plain

Title = {Effects of landscape cover and yard features on feral and free-roaming

   suburban area},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},

Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Feral and free-roaming domestic cats (Felis catus) are invasive
   predators throughout the world. In some areas, cats occur in higher
   densities than native mammalian predators and can have severe effects
   upon prey populations. We set 48 wildlife game cameras in residential
   yards in Arkansas, USA, to evaluate which landscape and yard features
   influenced cat abundance occurring in yards. In addition, we quantified
   the daily activity patterns of free-roaming cats and explored how
   habitat features or predator activity influenced the timing of cat
   activity. We found that cats were present in 70.8\% of yards with an
   average of three recognizable individuals per yard. Abundance of cats
   was higher than all native mesopredators except for raccoon (Procyon
   lotor) and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana). Cat abundance and
   minimum population decreased when forest cover was high within 400 m of
   the camera. Cats were active at all times of the day but tended to be
   more diurnal in areas closer to city centers or in agricultural
   settings. Conversely, cats were more nocturnal later in the summer and
   in areas that had high levels of predator activity. Our results indicate
   that cats are widespread in this region and their relative abundance is
   driven more by landscape features than by yard features, possibly due to
   their large home ranges. Cats may alter their activity to better coexist
   with predators. Alteration in yard features is unlikely to be an
   effective deterrent for cats and more direct control measures may be
   necessary.},

Title = {Domestic temporalities: Nature times in the house-as-home},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {40},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {1024-1032},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Studies of domestic temporalities have emphasised the timing of social
   activities and interactions in the home, including how family members
   negotiate their use of home spaces and technologies, the impact of
   flexible work practices on home, and the organisation of care and
   mothering activities. But home is also shaped by the rhythms and times
   of nonhumans that inhabit, travel through and are part of the
   house-as-home: it is further shaped by the environment outside home.
   Drawing inspiration from recent discussions of nature times the paper
   explores the more-than-human temporalities of domestic space. It charts
   the ageing and decay of house structures, the disruption caused by
   nocturnal animals, and the seasonal cycles of sunlight and plant growth
   that immediately surround the home, attending to the ways that these
   events shape everyday experiences of home and homemaking. These times
   and rhythms are examined through interviews undertaken with people
   living with uninvited brushtail possums in the ceilings of their homes,
   interviews and diaries completed by new dog owners, interviews with
   gardeners, and analysis of popular Australian homemaking magazines.
   These stories emphasise the dynamic and unfolding nature of the
   house-as-home as a hybrid timespace produced through an ongoing
   entwinement of human and nonhuman, living and non-living, culture and
   nature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   ecosystem services and human wellbeing: A case study from Lefke Region
   of North Cyprus},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {102},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Ornamental plants and relevant horticulture practices provide essential
   environmental, economic, social, and aesthetic benefits for human
   wellbeing. However, the contribution of ornamental plants-based
   ecosystem services (ESs) to human wellbeing (HWB) has not yet been
   explored in detail. This study was carried out with the aim of
   contributing to this knowledge gap. Accordingly, the purpose of this
   study is to evaluate the relationship between ornamental plants
   based-ESs and HWB in a home garden context in Lefke Region of North
   Cyprus. The objectives of the study were (i) to identify the ornamental
   plant species cultivated in the home gardens, (ii) to evaluate the major
   ornamental plants-based ESs, (iii) to assess the contributions of the
   relevant ESs to the HWB, and (iv) to examine the interrelationship
   between the different categories of ESs and HWB. The conceptual
   framework of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and a social preference
   valuation approach were adopted to assess the ornamental plants-based
   ESs, their contributions to the components of HWB, and interrelations
   amongst them. A number of qualitative (e.g. semi-structured interviews)
   and quantitative (e.g. a questionnaire) research tools were employed to
   collect the relevant data. The quantitative data obtained from 170
   residents were evaluated using a 0-5 Likert Scale. The field surveys
   revealed that the composition of ornamental plants in the home gardens
   consists of 233 plant species. Evaluation of the quantitative data
   showed that the average relative value of the ornamental plants-based
   ESs varies between the categories of habitat-based ESs (4,08 points) and
   regulating ESs (3,00 points). This finding indicates the significant
   role of ornamental plants for `habitat formation' and `wildlife
   attraction'. The most tagged components were `habitats for pets' and
   `aesthetic quality'. The ornamental plants-based ESs particularly
   contribute to the two components of HWB: `security' (4,51 points) and
   `contact with nature' (4,37 points). The relationship between the ESs
   and HWB was quantified on a 1-5 Likert scale. A high degree of
   correlation was found between the categories of `provisioning services'
   and `basic material for a good life' and also between the categories of
   `cultural services' and `development of good social relations' with a
   4,96 points. The lowest degree of correlation was estimated to be
   between the categories of `regulating services' and `development good
   social relations' with a 1,01 points. The results of this study may
   contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between
   the ornamental plants-based ESs and HWB in Lefke Region and elsewhere.},

   agroforestry (HAF). Tools of participatory rural appraisal namely
   semi-structured household interviews, group discussion and personal
   observation were used to collect data. In both types of agroforestry
   practices villagers planted commercially important local fruit species
   of which durian was the most common and more profitable. Locally
   available planting materials, use of household labour, market demand of
   agroforestry products, and usage of mulching and litter to maintain soil
   fertility were the principal attributes of sustainable agroforestry. A
   majority of the respondents reported that agroforestry was their
   principal source of income, selfemployment, and safe and healthy food.
   Income from per unit area of HAF was significantly higher (21 \%) than
   that of FAF. Land tenure and wildlife disturbances were two major
   constraints among others. Recommendations were made to resolve land
   tenure issue in light of government policy for agroforestry promotion.},

Title = {Habitat quality, urbanisation \& pesticides influence bird abundance and

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {870},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Gardens are regularly portrayed as green oases, refuges for wildlife
   that has been displaced from the countryside by intensive farming
   practices which have reduced habitat availability. Pesticides are also
   commonly used in urban areas, but few studies have investigated their
   impacts. In this study, we explored how bird richness and abundance in
   gardens across the UK are influenced by habitat quality, urbanisation
   level and pesticide practices. To achieve this, we collaborated with the
   British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) which runs Garden Birdwatch, a
   citizen-science-based garden bird recording scheme. Participants in the
   study were asked to complete a questionnaire about their pes-ticide
   practice. From the 615 gardens that provided useful data, we found that
   32.2 \% applied pesticides in their gar-dens and that glyphosate
   comprised 53.3 \% of these applications. We found that bird abundance
   and species richness was lower in suburban compared to rural gardens but
   positively influenced by measures of garden quality and by sur-rounding
   habitat quality. We show that there was an interaction between the
   habitat quality of the surrounding area and pesticide use: negative
   effects of pesticides on species richness were more pronounced in
   gardens in areas of high habitat quality compared to those surrounded by
   poor habitat. We found that pesticide use, and particularly glyphosate
   and metaldehyde, negatively predicted the abundance of house sparrows, a
   fast-declining bird species. The average house sparrow abundance was
   12.1 \% lower in gardens applying any pesticide, 24.9 \% lower with
   glyphosate, and 38.6 \% lower with metaldehyde. Overall, our study shows
   that garden bird abundance and richness is strongly influ-enced by both
   extrinsic and intrinsic factors, and suggests that garden management,
   particularly regarding pesticide use, has a significant effect on bird
   life.},

Abstract = {Introduction. Protected areas represent a huge reservoir of biological
   resources which local residents are highly dependent on. The
   non-inclusion of local knowledge is often an obstacle to conservation
   policy and sustainable use of biodiversity in these areas. The Reserve
   of Pama, located in the South-sudanian zone of Burkina Faso, is a good
   example of the discrepancy between the subsistence needs of local
   populations and the need to conserve biodiversity. Assessing the
   socio-economic importance of this reserve for local residents could lead
   to adapting a better strategy of natural resource management. Materials
   and methods. Ethnobotanical surveys were conducted based on interviews.
   The information obtained from the interrogation of 30 resource people
   identified the different uses made of the reserve by local people and
   the impact of these uses on the flora, and assessed the perception of
   villagers on the way of managing their forest resources. Results. A
   total of 58 plant species in the reserve, over 15\% of the local flora,
   provide various resources to local populations, including construction
   equipment (90\% response), medicinal plants (73.33\%), food plants
   (73.33\%), etc. The plant species most in demand were found to be, among
   others, Vitellaria paradoxa (80\%). Parkia biglobosa (66.67\%),
   Diospyros mespiliformis (33.33\%), Gardenia erubescens (33.33\%), Lannea
   microcarpa (33.33\%). Tamarindus indica (33.33\%), Anchypogon gayanus
   (26.67\%) and A. cbinensis (26.67\%). Some of these species have proved
   increasingly rare due to the deterioration of climatic conditions, abuse
   of green wood and soil depletion. Conclusion. The study we conducted on
   the reserve of Pama leads us to advocate stronger measures to protect
   the environment through the involvement of local residents. Moreover,
   the field planting of useful species in the process of depletion would
   be able to limit the operating pressure on the reserve.},

Title = {Connecting people with place-specific nature in cities reduces
   unintentional harm},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH: ECOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {There is an increasing disconnect between people and nature as we become
   more urbanised. Intensification in cities often results in a reduction
   of natural areas, more homogenised and manicured green spaces, and loss
   of biota. Compared to people in rural areas, urban dwellers are less
   likely visit natural areas and recognise and value biota. Reconnecting
   people with nature in the city not only benefits human mental and
   physical wellbeing but can also have positive effects on how people
   value biodiversity and act on conservation issues. However, in some
   contexts, the push to reconnect people with nature may have unintended
   negative outcomes on biodiversity, particularly if place-specific nature
   is not used in urban greening. In the current biodiversity crisis, using
   vegetation and green space design that is not reflective of the
   environmental context of a city can further disconnect residents,
   particularly Indigenous people, from their local environment and
   species, and further entrench extinction of experience and loss of
   environmental values. This disconnect can result in residents applying
   wildlife gardening practices, such as bird feeding, that are not
   specific to place, and benefit introduced species over indigenous
   species. Furthermore, cities are gateways for invasive species, and
   using species in greening projects that are not locally sourced has
   already left cities and their surrounding regions with a large weed
   legacy. Using place-specific nature and green space in cities can be
   less resource intensive, highly beneficial for biodiversity and give
   residents a unique sense of place. Rather than simply adding `more
   nature' in cities, the messaging should be more complex, emphasising the
   need for urban greening to be context specific to avoid negative impacts
   on biodiversity and ecological and cultural services.},

Abstract = {In 2005-2008, we radio-tracked 17 foxes in rural areas of Southern
   Germany. The mean home range size was 76.6 ha (95\% MCP) or 138.9 ha
   (95\% fixed kernel), and the built-up area formed an integral part of
   the home range. Home ranges of juvenile foxes were significantly smaller
   than home ranges of adult foxes. Gender-specific differences among adult
   foxes were not established. A minimum population density of 2.7 foxes
   per km(2) and summer densities of up to 13.4 foxes per km(2) were
   calculated. Therefore, the fox density was three to eight times higher
   than that of strictly rural foxes. Daytime resting sites of foxes were
   mostly found in forests (62.2\%) and reedbed areas (20.6\%). Of the
   resting sites, 14.8\% were situated inside settlements, in fallow
   gardens or gardens of residents. During the day, foxes exhibited habitat
   preferences for forests and reedbed areas. A habitat structure that
   offers plenty of cover or dense vegetation is essential for its
   selection as a safe resting site. If this basic requirement is
   fulfilled, foxes also choose resting sites within settlements, and are
   not disturbed by human presence.},

Abstract = {Total grazing pressure (TGP) is a key driver of productivity in
   livestock systems in the south-eastern rangelands of Australia.
   Sustainable grazing in these environments requires the management of
   grazing pressure from kangaroos, unmanaged goats and feral pigs, as well
   as livestock. Any practices used to control these species must be
   socially acceptable. Twenty-four semi-structured interviews with
   individuals drawn from key stakeholder groups were conducted to assess
   the acceptability of control practices for each of these species.
   Commercial shooting was the most acceptable control practice for
   kangaroos with a much lower acceptance of non-commercial shooting. A
   trap yard (at a water point) was the most acceptable practice for
   control of unmanaged goats with shooting least acceptable. Ground
   shooting, trapping and 1080 baiting were the most acceptable practices
   for control of feral pigs with dogging least acceptable. The two key
   criteria for social acceptance of control practices by stakeholder group
   interviewees were humaneness and effectiveness. Acceptance was also
   influenced by interviewees' attitudes towards particular species.
   Interviewees typically distinguished between control of native wildlife
   and `feral' animals, and between `resource' animals and `pest' animals.
   Importantly, support for control programs to manage TGP must be
   justifiable and employ practices that are socially acceptable.},

Abstract = {The conservation of biological diversity in landscapes dominated by
   human use is emerging as an increasingly significant challenge, given
   the rate at which the Earth's remaining vegetation resources are being
   lost. Whilst traditional approaches to conservation have relied upon the
   ability of species to persist within the scattered fragments to which
   they have been confined, recent scientific evidence suggests that the
   long-term viability of fragmented populations may only be secured
   through the establishment of ecological connectivity between existing
   fragments.
   In the absence of a suitable methodology within which to design
   connective habitat configurations, a conceptual approach to landscape
   design was devised for a highly urbanised environment within the
   Shellharbour Local Government Area (LGA), New South Wales (NSW). This
   approach utilises beneficial landscape attributes advocated in the
   literature, and tailors existing rapid assessment methodologies
   traditionally used to provide simple measures of ecosystem health. Using
   this methodology, conservationally significant stepping-stone sites were
   identified between selected terminal habitat patches. The determination
   of an optimal corridor configuration linking these patches was found to
   heavily utilise riparian habitat and adjacent residential yard space.
   Planting endemic species in these areas will support ecological flow by
   increasing the area of core habitat relative to edge habitat. (c) 2008

Abstract = {The extent and continued expansion of urbanisation has focused attention
   on the significance for native biodiversity of those green spaces
   remaining within such areas and the most appropriate methods of managing
   them. In the UK, a high proportion of urban space is comprised of the
   private or domestic gardens associated with residential dwellings, and
   many recommendations have been made for simple changes to improve their
   value for biodiversity ('wildlife gardening'). Here, we report the
   results of replicated experimental tests of five such common
   recommendations, involving the introduction to gardens of (i) artificial
   nest sites for solitary bees and wasps; (ii) artificial nest sites for
   bumblebees; (iii) small ponds; (iv) dead wood for fungi and other
   saproxylic organisms; and ( v) patches of nettles Urtica dioica L. for
   butterfly larvae. The broad conclusion is that whilst some methods for
   increasing the biodiversity of garden environments may be very
   effective, others have a low probability of success on the timescales
   and spatial scales likely to be acceptable to many garden owners. If one
   of the functions of small scale biodiversity enhancement is to develop
   and encourage awareness of biodiversity and its conservation, then
   encouragement to conduct particular activities must be balanced with a
   realistic appraisal of their likely success.},

Abstract = {Collection-based institutions-zoos, aquariums, museums, and botanical
   gardens-exhibit wildlife and thus have a special connection with nature.
   Many of these institutions emphasize a mission of conservation, and,
   undeniably, they do contribute directly to conservation education and
   conservation science. They present an exceptional opportunity for many
   urban residents to see the wonders of life, and they can contribute to
   education and habitat preservation. Because many collection-based
   institutions now hold a stated mission of conservation, we suggest eight
   potential questions to evaluate actions toward that mission: (1) Does
   conservation thought define policy decisions? (2) Is there sufficient
   organizational funding for conservation activities? (3) Is there a
   functional conservation department? (4) Does the institution advocate
   for conservation? (5) Do conservation education programs effectively
   target children and adults? (6) Does the institution contribute directly
   to habitat protection locally and internationally? (7) Do exhibits
   explain and promote conservation efforts? and (8) Do internal policies
   and activities protect the environment? These questions are offered as a
   place to begin discussion. We hope they will help employees and
   administrators of a collection-based institution (and citizens of the
   surrounding community) think about and support their institution's
   conservation activities. Public support and praise for institutions that
   are striving toward solutions for conservation problems and pressure on
   organizations that are moving more slowly toward a conservation
   orientation can help shift more resources toward saving nature.},

Volume = {122},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Although urban areas are often considered to have uniformly negative
   effects on biodiversity, cities are most accurately characterized as
   heterogeneous mosaics of buildings, streets, parks, and gardens that
   include both good' and bad' areas for wildlife. However, to date, few
   studies have evaluated how human impacts vary in direction and magnitude
   across a heterogeneous urban landscape. In this study, we assessed the
   distribution of floral resources and flower-visiting insects across a
   variety of land uses in New York City. We visited both green spaces
   (e.g. parks, cemeteries) and heavily developed neighborhood blocks (e.g.
   with high or low density residential zoning) and used structural
   equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of
   median income, vegetation, and development intensity on floral resources
   and insects in both settings. Abundance and taxonomic richness of
   flower-visiting insects was significantly greater in green spaces than
   neighborhood blocks. The SEM results indicated that heavily-developed
   neighborhoods generally had fewer flower-visiting insects consistent
   with reductions in floral resources. However, some low-density
   residential neighborhoods maintained high levels of floral resources and
   flower-visiting insects. We found that the effects of surrounding
   vegetation on floral resources, and thus indirect effects on insects,
   varied considerably between green spaces and neighborhood blocks. Along
   neighborhood blocks, vegetation consisted of a mosaic of open gardens
   and sparsely distributed trees and had a positive indirect effect on
   flower-visiting insects. In contrast, vegetation in urban green spaces
   was associated with increased canopy cover and thus had a negative
   indirect effect on flower-visiting insects through reductions in floral
   resources. In both neighborhood blocks and green spaces, vegetation had
   a positive direct effect on flower-visiting insects independent of the
   influence of vegetation on floral resources. Our results demonstrate how
   inter-related components of an urban ecosystem can vary with respect to
   one another across a heterogeneous urban landscape, suggesting that it
   is inappropriate to generalize about urban systems as a whole without
   first addressing differences among component land use types.},

Note = {BOU Annual Meeting on Birds as Predators and as Prey, Univ Leicester,

Abstract = {Even though they are fed daily by their owners, free-ranging pet cats
   Felis catus may kill wild birds and, given their high densities
   (typically > 200 cats/km(2)), it has been postulated that cat predation
   could be a significant negative factor affecting the dynamics of urban
   bird populations. In this study, we: (1) used questionnaire surveys in
   10 sites within the city of Bristol, UK, to estimate cat density; (2)
   estimated the number of birds killed annually in five sites by asking
   cat owners to record prey animals returned home; and then (3) compared
   the number of birds killed with breeding density and productivity to
   estimate the potential impact of cat predation. In addition, we (4)
   compared the condition of those birds killed by cats versus those killed
   in collisions, e.g. window strikes. Mean (+/- sd) cat density was 348
   +/- 86 cats/km(2) (n = 10 sites); considering the eight species most
   commonly taken by cats, the mean ratios of adult birds/cats and juvenile
   birds/cats across the five sites were 1.17 +/- 0.23 and 3.07 +/- 0.74,
   respectively. Approximately 60\% of the cats studied for up to 1 year at
   each site never returned any prey home; despite this, the estimated
   number of birds killed was large relative to their breeding density and
   productivity in many sites. Across species, cat-killed birds were in
   significantly poorer condition than those killed following collisions;
   this is consistent with the notion that cat predation represents a
   compensatory rather than additive form of mortality. Interpretation of
   these results is, however, complicated by patterns of body mass
   regulation in passerines. The predation rates estimated in this study
   would suggest that cats were likely to have been a major cause of
   mortality for some species of birds. The effect of cat predation in
   urban landscapes therefore warrants further investigation. The potential
   limitations of the current study are discussed, along with suggestions
   for resolving them.},

Abstract = {Red foxes thrive in towns and cities, where much of their food is
   deliberately provided by humans. We studied fox foraging behavior using
   camera traps in residential gardens where householders regularly fed
   foxes. Predictable feeding patterns attracted foxes to gardens, females
   were more efficient foragers than males, and dominant foxes enjoyed
   priority access to food, so that subordinates had to adopt compensatory
   strategies. Understanding how foxes exploit resources may help address
   conflicts in urban areas. In patchy environments, foragers adopt
   different strategies to acquire resources depending on their internal
   state and external physical and social environment: this has important
   fitness consequences. Linking individual variation in patch use to
   tangible characteristics is key to understand many higher-level
   ecological processes. We studied patch use by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes)
   in the city of Bristol, UK. We placed camera traps in gardens where
   householders provisioned foxes (patches) to investigate whether 1) foxes
   discriminated between patches based on food availability, quantified as
   provisioning frequency (predictability) and the energy value of
   provisioned food; and 2) individual patch use varied with dominance,
   gender, and season. Increased frequency of provisioning encouraged more
   foxes to visit and to stay longer in patches. All foxes visited the most
   predictable patches first each day, but females were more selective and
   generally more efficient foragers than males. Females increased foraging
   effort during cub rearing, whereas males reduced patch use in the
   dispersal and mating season. Dominants and subordinates shared patches
   spatiotemporally, possibly facilitated by relatedness and familiarity
   between group members. However, dominants visited more food patches on
   their territory, spent more time in predictable patches and fed earlier
   than subordinates. Subordinates may compensate for competition by
   visiting patches of lower quality or outside their territory, which is
   inefficient and risky. Our results demonstrate gender differences in
   behavioral motivation, show how subordinates forego foraging efficiency
   to mitigate intra-group competition and reveal how human provisioning
   influences fox space use in urban areas.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly modified Earth's social-ecological
   systems in many ways; here we study its impacts on human-nature
   interactions. We conducted an online survey focused on peoples'
   relationships with the non-human world during the pandemic and received
   valid responses from 3,204 adult residents of the state of Vermont
   (U.S.A.). We analyzed reported changes in outdoor activities and the
   values associated with human-nature relationships across geographic
   areas and demographic characteristics. We find that participation
   increased on average for some activities (foraging, gardening, hiking,
   jogging, photography and other art, relaxing alone, walking, and
   watching wildlife), and decreased for others (camping, relaxing with
   others). The values respondents ranked as more important during the
   pandemic factored into two groups, which we label as ``Nurture and
   Recreation values{''} and ``Inspiration and Nourishment values.{''}
   Using multinomial logistic regression, we found that respondents'
   preferences for changes in activity engagement and value factors are
   statistically associated with some demographic characteristics,
   including geography, gender, income, and employment status during the
   pandemic. Our results suggest that nature may play an important role in
   coping during times of crisis, but that the specific interactions and
   associated values that people perceive as most important may vary
   between populations. Our findings emphasize for both emergency and
   natural resources planning the importance of understanding variation in
   how and why people interact with and benefit from nature during crises.},

Abstract = {Understanding how threatened species adapt their behavior to landscapes
   shaped by humans is increasingly important to ensuring they persist in a
   changing world. Matrix habitats can be shared spaces where human and
   nonhuman primates coexist. We set out to determine how an endemic,
   threatened forest specialist, the frugivorous, arboreal samango monkey
   (Cercopithecus albogularis labiatus), has responded to a matrix habitat
   made up of residential gardens and commercial plantations in Eastern
   Cape province, South Africa. We followed two groups from dawn to dusk
   for a mean of 3 days/mo for 12 mo (February 1, 2011 to January 31, 2012)
   using scan sampling to collect data on their diet, activity, and ranging
   patterns. We used resource abundance transects to describe the groups'
   home ranges and monitored tree phenology to calculate fruit and seed
   availability indices. Monkeys from both groups consumed large quantities
   of exotic plant species, accounting for > 50\% of their overall annual
   diet, with seeds of the invasive black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) the most
   commonly consumed exotic species followed by acorns of two oak species
   (Quercus robur and Q. palustris.). However, monkeys responded to the
   availability of indigenous rather than exotic fruits and seeds and
   increased their consumption of exotics when indigenous fruits were less
   available. Although monkeys spent less time moving when feeding on
   exotic species compared to indigenous species, eating exotics did not
   free up monkeys' time to rest or socialize, as additional time was
   required to process exotic foods. To offset the possible negative
   consequences of the monkeys' reliance on exotic seeds, including
   escalating conflict between monkeys and people in gardens, we suggest
   gradual removal of exotic plant species in the habitat and replacement
   with indigenous species as one mitigation strategy.},

Title = {Site selection by geese in a suburban landscape},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {Background. In European and North American cities geese are among the
   most common and most visible large herbivores. As such, their presence
   and behaviour often conflict with the desires of the human residents.
   Fouling, noise, aggression and health concerns are all cited as reasons
   that there are ``too many{''}. Lethal control is often used for
   population management; however, this raises questions about whether this
   is a sustainable strategy to resolve the conflict between humans and
   geese when, paradoxically, it is humans that are responsible for
   creating the habitat and often providing the food and protection of
   geese at other times. We hypothesise that the landscaping of suburban
   parks can be improved to decrease its attractiveness to geese and to
   reduce the opportunity for conflict between geese and humans.
   Methods. Using observations collected over five years from a botanic
   garden situated in suburban Belgium and data from the whole of Flanders
   in Belgium, we examined landscape features that attract geese. These
   included the presence of islands in lakes, the distance from water,
   barriers to level flight and the size of exploited areas. The birds
   studied were the tadornine goose Alopochen aegyptiaca (L. 1766)
   (Egyptian goose) and the anserine geese, Branta canadensis (L. 1758)
   (Canada goose), Anser anser (L. 1758) (greylag goose) and Branta
   leucopsis (Bechstein, 1803) (barnacle goose). Landscape modification is
   a known method for altering goose behaviour, but there is little
   information on the power of such methods with which to inform managers
   and planners.
   Results. Our results demonstrate that lakes with islands attract more
   than twice as many anserine geese than lakes without islands, but make
   little difference to Egyptian geese. Furthermore, flight barriers
   between grazing areas and lakes are an effective deterrent to geese
   using an area for feeding. Keeping grazing areas small and surrounded by
   trees reduces their attractiveness to geese.
   Conclusion. The results suggest that landscape design can be used
   successfully to reduce the number of geese and their conflict with
   humans. However, this approach has its limitations and would require
   humans to compromise on what they expect from their landscaped parks,
   such as open vistas, lakes, islands and closely cropped lawns.},

Title = {For the Love of Nature: Exploring the Importance of Species Diversity
   and Micro-Variables Associated with Favorite Outdoor Places},

Abstract = {Although the restorative benefits of nature are widely acknowledged,
   there is a limited understanding of the attributes of natural
   environments that are fundamental to restorative experiences. Faced with
   growing human populations and a greater awareness of the wellbeing
   benefits natural environments provide, park agencies and planners are
   increasingly challenged with balancing human and ecological outcomes in
   natural areas. This study examines the physical and experiential
   qualities of natural environments people referred to when describing
   their connection to their most valued natural environments in an online
   questionnaire. Recruited primarily via a public radio program,
   respondents were asked to identify their favorite places and explain
   what they loved about those places. Favorite places are considered
   exemplars of restorative environments and were classified based on an
   existing park typology. Reasons people liked particular sites were
   classified into three domains: setting, activity, or benefit. Content
   analysis was used to identify the attributes most commonly associated
   with favorite places. These attributes were then related to the four
   components of restorative environments according to Attention
   Restoration Theory. In contrast to previous research, we found that
   ``fascination{''} was the most important component of favorite places.
   Possible reasons for this contrast, namely, respondents' median age, and
   the likelihood of a high degree of ecological literacy amongst the study
   population are discussed. South Australians' favorite environments
   comprise primarily hilly, wooded nature parks, and botanical gardens, in
   stark contrast to the vast arid areas that dominate the state.
   Micro-variables such as birds, plants, wildlife, native species, and
   biodiversity appear particularly important elements used to explain
   people's love of these sites. We discuss the implications of these
   findings and their potential value as an anchor for marketing campaigns
   seeking to encourage contact with nature, as well as education programs
   designed to improve people's understanding of important but intangible
   concepts such as biodiversity. The findings have clear, practical
   implications for park managers given the modifiable nature of many of
   the attributes identified as being most important to our respondents,
   and we believe attention to such elements has the potential to
   simultaneously enhance people's nature experiences, optimize restorative
   outcomes, and improve environmental stewardship.},

Abstract = {The main attractions of national parks include their scenic beauty,
   security, wildlife and trees. For preserving and maintaining national
   parks, an appropriate pricing policy can be used. The current study
   focuses on using the travel cost method (TCM) and contingent valuation
   method (CVM) as a non-market valuation technique to value the National
   Botanical Garden in Bangladesh, a developing country where little or no
   previous works of this kind has been conducted before. The main
   objective of the paper was to suggest an appropriate entrance fee for
   the park by assessing the willingness to pay (WTP) from the TCM and CVM;
   by determining a revenue maximizing entrance fee from the CVM; and by
   considering socio-demographics, the characteristics of visits and the
   motivation of the visitors to preserve the National Botanical Garden.
   The study sampled 100 visitors. These visitors participated in a survey
   which consisted of closed questions followed by a semi structured
   in-depth interview. For data processing, SPSS and Microsoft Excel were
   used. Based on the travel cost demand function using the TCM, the study
   found that the amount respondents were willing to pay for entrance was
   0.955 US dollars and yearly consumer surplus was 593634.5 USD. From the
   CVM, it was estimated that the WTP was 0.225 USD for the entrance and
   revenue maximizing entrance fee was 0.376 USD. Finally, the entrance fee
   suggested for National Botanical Garden was around 0.225 USD.},

Abstract = {Sabah, on the northeastern corner of Borneo, is concurrently Malaysia's
   largest producer of oil palm (Elaeisguineensis)and home to the
   endangered Bornean elephants (Elephas maximus bomeensis; elephants).
   Concomitantly, Sabah has been experiencing increasing and unsustainable
   human-elephant conflicts (HECs), which have not been thoroughly
   investigated from a human dimensions standpoint. To address this void,
   in March 2019, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 37 villagers
   located in the Sabah districts of Lahad Datu, Tawau, and Telupid to
   investigate villager cognitions regarding elephants, behaviors toward
   elephants, the formal and informal village institutions employed to
   mediate HECs, and the future viability of human-elephant coexistence.
   Respondents highlighted emotions of fear, anger, and frustration over
   crop and property damage that villagers were unable to effectively
   mitigate employing traditional institutions and strategies. Although
   negative emotions were somewhat tempered by the cultural significance of
   elephants, respondents indicated that coexistence with elephants remains
   challenging and is likely only viable under certain conditions:
   domestication of elephants, if elephants no longer destroyed crops,
   and/or if elephants were provided separate forested habitat away from
   humans. Our results demonstrated that elephant conservation in Sabah is
   viewed as a ``not in my backyard{''} claim, which can hint at the
   presence of environmental injustice. We further examined Sabah HECs
   using an environmental justice framework and concluded that HEC as an
   environmental justice problem requires traditional fixes to be merged
   with more extensive, sustainable solutions that improve stakeholder
   agency.},

Abstract = {ContextGlobally, with the continuous increase in human populations,
   unprecedented changes in land use are taking place. Little is known
   about how African reptiles respond to this rapid land use
   change.ObjectivesWe used sightings to establish if Nile monitors
   (Varanus niloticus) are persisting in a mosaic of human population
   densities and land use types in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South
   Africa.MethodsWe collected sighting data throughout KwaZulu-Natal
   between April 2022 and July 2023, using three main methods, namely urban
   sightings obtained from reptile relocation groups and collaborations
   with reptile relocators; sightings obtained from personal encounters and
   citizen scientist observations using social media,s posters, newspaper
   articles and interviews; and sightings from iNaturalist
   observations.ResultsWe obtained and used 419 sightings and then
   identified two hotspot areas in the province on which we chose to focus.
   Site A was dominated by natural habitat, and anthropogenic land use
   types dominated site B. We found a significant relative selection
   strength for most tested land covers over anthropogenic cover in site A,
   whereas most were insignificant in site B. Our results suggest that the
   use of anthropogenic land use types by Nile monitors in KwaZulu-Natal
   may be driven by habitat transformation and loss. Nile monitors were
   found persisting in urban mosaic landscapes and, when compared with
   available cover, were found in increasingly wooded (natural and urban
   vegetation) areas with increased human populations. Furthermore, they
   used small anthropogenic water bodies (e.g., swimming pools and storm
   drains), making them less reliant on rivers in urban environments. Their
   population demographics were similar in low and high human population
   density, but there appeared to be a skew towards smaller and younger
   individuals in medium human population density areas. Reproduction was
   occurring successfully in urban environments, but the detection of
   larger monitors by potential wild and domestic predators and negative
   human interactions pose risks. Our study outlined the importance of
   natural and managed (e.g., gardens, parks, golf courses) green spaces in
   urban mosaic landscapes for wildlife persistence, specifically Nile
   monitors, and supporting human well-being as well as reptile
   conservation. There is an overall need for more research on this highly
   exploited yet understudied reptilian urban adapter.},

   2 yr of a long-term study of ground arthropods of Phoenix, AZ, focusing
   on the communities assembled in agricultural fields, commercial sites,
   mesic and xeric residential yards, desert remnants surrounded by the
   city, and peripheral natural desert. Agricultural fields and mesic
   residential yards generally supported the greatest number of individuals
   and taxa, showed the best separation from other types in ordination
   analyses, and bad the greatest number of significantly associated taxa
   in indicator species analysis. Thus, of the urban habitats, two heavily
   irrigated and highly productive land use types seem to stand apart from
   the others in most community measures. Outlying desert sites also
   supported significantly associated taxa, including those not found
   regularly in desert parks and members of higher trophic levels less
   common in the city. Despite this, outlying desert and desert parks
   supported similar taxon richness. Xeric residential yards and commercial
   sites did not support any taxa not found in other land use types. While
   our results may be dependent on the location of Phoenix in the
   water-limited Sonoran Desert, we urge broader consideration of highly
   modified urban landscapes as wildlife habitat.},

Abstract = {Domestic gardens represent a site for enacting embodied identity and
   social relationships in later life, and negotiating tensions between
   continuity and change. In the context of dementia, domestic gardens have
   significant implications for `living well' at home, and for wider
   discussions around embodiment, relational selfhood and agency. Yet
   previous studies exploring dementia and gardens have predominantly
   focused on care home or community contexts. In light of this, the paper
   explores the role of domestic gardens in the everyday lives of people
   living with dementia and their households, using qualitative, creative
   methods. This includes filmed walking interviews and garden tours,
   diaries and sketch methods, involving repeat visits with six households
   in England. Findings are organised thematically in relation to different
   `ways of being' in the garden: working in and doing the garden; being in
   and sensing; and playing, empowerment and agency. These different `ways
   of being' are situated within relationships with household members,
   neighbours and non-human actors, including pets, wildlife and the
   materiality of the garden. Garden practices illustrate continuity,
   situated within embodied biographies and habitus. However, identities,
   practices and gardens are also subject to ongoing readjustment and
   reconstruction. The conclusion discusses implications for extending
   literature on gardens and later life, describing how social and material
   relationships in domestic gardens are renegotiated in the context of
   dementia, while highlighting opportunities for `play', active sensing
   and agency. We also explore contributions to understandings of dementia,
   home and place, and implications for garden design and care practice.},

Abstract = {1,3-Diphenylguanidine (DPG), benzothiazole (BTH), benzotriazole (BTR),
   and their derivatives are high-production -volume chemicals widely used
   in tires, corrosion inhibitors and plastic products. Vehicular traffic
   is an important source of these chemicals in the environment. Despite
   this, little is known about the occurrence of these chemicals in
   roadside soils. In this study, we determined the concentrations,
   profiles, and distribution patterns of 3 DPGs, 5 BTHs, and 7 BTRs in 110
   soil samples collected from northeastern United States. We found
   widespread occurrence of 12 out of the 15 analytes measured in roadside
   soils, at detection frequencies >= 71 \% and median concentrations in
   the range of 0.38-380 ng/g (dry weight). DPGs were the predominant
   chemicals accounting for 63 \% of the sum concentrations of three
   chemical classes determined, followed by BTHs (28 \%) and BTRs (9 \%).
   The concentrations of all analytes (except for 1-, 4-, and 5-OH-BTRs)
   exhibited significant positive correlations (r: 0.1-0.9, p < 0.01),
   sug-gestive of their common sources and/or similar environmental fates.
   Higher concentrations of DPGs, BTHs and BTRs were found in soils from
   highways, rubberized playgrounds, and indoor parking lots than those
   from gardens, parks, and residential areas. Our findings suggest the
   release of DPGs, BTHs and BTRs from rubber products, especially
   auto-mobile tires. Further studies are needed to investigate the
   environmental fate and toxicities of these chemicals to humans and

Year = {1998},
Volume = {62},

Pages = {864-871},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Loss of nesting habitat due to urbanization and development has been
   identified as a primary threat to Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii),
   but this species can successfully nest in some urbanized areas. Hence,
   understanding the features of urban areas that promote occupancy by
   Cooper's hawks may become important in managing for the species. We
   measured nest tree, site, slid area features at 49 Cooper's hawk nests
   representing 33 breeding pairs in Tucson, Arizona between 1993 and 1996.
   Introduced eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.; 70.8\%), aleppo pine (Pinus
   halepensis; 25.0\%), and native cottonwood trees (Populus fremontii;
   4.2\%) were used as nest trees to a greater extent than expected based
   on their availability (P < 0.001). Urban nest trees were taller and of
   greater diameter than random trees. Nest sites (0.08 ha) were
   characterized by greater basal area, canopy cover, and number of trees
   >10 m tall when compared to random sites. Most nest trees were located
   in the yards of single-family residences (48.3\%) and in high-use
   recreational areas (28.3\%). Dominant land-use types in nest areas were
   high-density residential areas (65.9\%) and high-use recreational areas
   (22.7\%). Levels of human disturbance at nest sites did not appear to
   influence nest-site selection. Density of Cooper's hawks nests in Tucson
   was higher thrill in exurban areas and probably was associated with the
   large trees, water, and abundance of prey in the city. Maintaining nest
   sites for Cooper's hawks in Tucson will require maintaining groves of
   large trees.},

Title = {Does Historical Coexistence with Dingoes Explain Current Avoidance of
   Domestic Dogs? Island Bandicoots Are Naive to Dogs, unlike Their
   Mainland Counterparts},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {Introduced predators have a global reputation for causing declines and
   extinctions of native species. Native prey naivete towards novel
   predators is thought to be a key reason for predator impacts. However,
   naivete is not necessarily forever: where coexistence establishes, it is
   likely that naivete will be reduced through adaptation, and the once
   alien predator will eventually become recognised by prey. For example,
   native marsupial bandicoots in Sydney avoid backyards with domestic dogs
   (C. lupus familiaris), but not domestic cats (Felis catus), even though
   cats and dogs were both introduced about 200 years ago (Carthey and
   Banks 2012). The authors attributed bandicoots' recognition of dogs to
   long-term exposure to a close relative of dogs, dingoes that arrived in
   Australia 4000 years ago. Here, we test a prediction of this hypothesis
   by taking the study to Tasmania, where dingoes have never been present
   but where domestic dogs also arrived about 200 years ago. We use a
   similar survey design to that of Carthey and Banks (2012): asking Hobart
   residents to report on pet-ownership, bandicoot sightings and scats
   within their backyards, as well as an array of yard characteristic
   control variables. We predicted that if long term experience with
   dingoes enabled mainland bandicoots to recognise domestic dogs, then
   Tasmanian bandicoots, which are inexperienced with dingoes, would not
   recognise domestic dogs. Our results indicate that Tasmanian bandicoots
   are naive to both dogs and cats after only 200 years of coexistence,
   supporting our hypothesis and the notion that naivete in native prey
   towards alien predators (as observed on the mainland) may eventually be
   overcome.},

Abstract = {In situ propagation of butterflies was attempted through establishment
   of a butterfly garden in a 0.5 ha degraded moist deciduous forest patch
   at the Kerala Forest Research Institute campus at Peechi, Kerala, India.
   Creation of butterfly habitats through landscaping and introduction of
   suitable host plants to sustain different species of butterflies were
   the major activities undertaken. There was tremendous increase in the
   butterfly population with 4509 sightings of butterflies belonging to 43
   species after 15 months and 10,502 sightings of butterflies belonging to
   56 species after 30 months. These included eight species that are
   endemic to the Western Ghats and ten species having protected status
   under the Indian Wildlife Act. Investigations on the relationship
   between the occurrence of different butterflies and the weather
   conditions revealed that an average temperature ranging between 25 and
   26 degrees C was most favourable for many butterflies followed by 23 and
   25 degrees C as well as 27 and 29 degrees C. Similarly, atmospheric
   humidity ranging between 80 and 100\% was the most preferred range
   followed by 60 and 80\%. With regard to daily rainfall, 50 mm was the
   most favourable followed by 50-100 mm rainfall. Heavy rainfall was found
   to be unfavourable since few butterflies were observed above 100 mm of
   daily rainfall. By regulating humidity and temperature, it was possible
   to manipulate local populations of butterflies, particularly danaid
   butterflies. More or less continuous population was noticed for some
   Danaidae, Lycaenidae, Papilionidae and Pieridae, which also developed
   resident populations in the study area. Strategies were also
   standardized for setting up butterfly gardens.},

   attitudes, whereas livestock owners expressed negative to neutral
   attitudes and revealed a Not-In-My-Backyard sentiment. We found that
   positive attitudes were linked to a greater receptiveness to increased
   wolf numbers, particularly in areas of irregular wolf presence. Fear was
   a significant driver of public attitudes, while the presence of wolves
   influenced livestock owners'views. For both groups, attitudes were also
   influenced by perceived costs and benefits. Knowledge about wolves did
   not significantly influence attitudes, with scores being consistently
   low across groups, and the myth of reintroduction persisting. Thus,
   management actions should address the concerns and complaints of
   individuals directly affected by wolves, dispel common fears and myths,
   and emphasize the ecological and economic benefits of wolf presence in
   the territory. Media outlets can serve as strategic partners in engaging
   the neutral population through untargeted interventions. Prioritizing
   the input of all groups, including conservationists, is essential for
   establishing common ground and ensuring sustained coexistence.},

Title = {To kill or not to kill? Exploring normative beliefs and attitudes toward
   snakes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {290},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Whether or not people believe killing snakes is morally acceptable
   affects the likelihood of harming them. An alternative is translocation,
   wherein snakes are relocated to nearby habitat. In our study based in
   semi-arid Phoenix, Arizona (USA), we examine residents' normative
   beliefs about killing snakes across different situations. Analyzing data
   from two survey samples-one of clients who paid for translocation and
   another of residents broadly, we assess if clients exhibit greater
   opposition to killing snakes and more positive attitudes toward them
   compared to the sample of residents, potentially indicating that
   translocation decisions might be intended as acts of conservation.
   Lastly, we address: to what extent do varied attitudes toward snakes,
   experiences with snakes, and socio-demographics influence people's
   beliefs about killing snakes overall and across distinct contexts: on
   private property and in residential homes or yards, as well as anytime,
   in desert habitat, and if someone is bitten? Our analyses demonstrate
   that residents substantially oppose killing snakes, although normative
   beliefs vary by context. Additionally, the client sample was more
   opposed to killing snakes and expressed more positive attitudes than
   residents broadly. Although disgust and other attitudes explain norms
   generally, different attitudes and socio-demographics affect norms
   depending on the context. Finally, although more frequent experiences
   with snakes did not impact norms in our analyses, experiences with
   snakes did increase positive attitudes toward them. Based on our
   findings, we recommend experiential learning to enhance appreciation of
   snakes and call for more research on the outcomes of translocations to
   ensure these decisions aid snake conservation.},

Journal = {URSUS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is the largest carnivore in Turkey and has
   been legally protected since 2003. However, increasing levels of
   conflict between brown bears and humans have been reported for several
   regions, especially for Artvin in northeastern Turkey. We documented the
   conflict in an attempt to understand human attitudes and responses and
   evaluate existing and potential damage prevention techniques. The study
   was conducted within landscapes at different scales, ranging from a core
   area defined by a large valley system to the whole of the Artvin
   Province. Data on close encounters, injuries, and damage caused were
   collected through government records, published literature, and
   open-ended interviews with the local people. On more than two-thirds of
   close encounters recorded, no harm Occurred to bear or people. Bear
   attacks on humans were rare and only occasionally led to non-fatal
   injuries. Nevertheless, several bears were shot and killed in the study
   area during the Study (2002-2005). apparently as a consequence of damage
   experienced by farmers. Interviews indicated a widespread belief that
   bears have become more of a problem. Bear damage was reported mostly in
   late summer for field crops and orchards and in spring for beehives.
   Precautions taken by villagers relied mostly on locally available
   technologies and varied in effectiveness against bears. We propose that
   introduction and implementation of modern techniques of exclusion Such
   as portable electric fences around valuable resources (e.g. bee yards),
   improvements in bear awareness, and effective cooperation among various
   stakeholders Would reduce human-bear conflict to acceptable levels in
   the region.},

Title = {The domestic garden - Its contribution to urban green infrastructure},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {129-137},
Abstract = {Domestic gardens provide a significant component of urban green
   infrastructure but their relative contribution to eco-system service
   provision remains largely un-quantified. `Green infrastructure' itself
   is often ill-defined, posing problems for planners to ascertain what
   types of green infrastructure provide greatest benefit and under what
   circumstances. Within this context the relative merits of gardens are
   unclear; however, at a time of greater urbanization where private
   gardens are increasingly seen as a `luxury', it is important to define
   their role precisely. Hence, the nature of this review is to interpret
   existing information pertaining to gardens/gardening per se, identify
   where they may have a unique role to play and to highlight where further
   research is warranted. The review suggests that there are significant
   differences in both form and management of domestic gardens which
   radically influence the benefits. Nevertheless, gardens can play a
   strong role in improving the environmental impact of the domestic
   curtilage, e.g. by insulating houses against temperature extremes they
   can reduce domestic energy use. Gardens also improve localized air
   cooling, help mitigate flooding and provide a haven for wildlife. Less
   favourable aspects include contributions of gardens and gardening to
   greenhouse gas emissions, misuse of fertilizers and pesticides, and
   introduction of alien plant species. Due to the close proximity to the
   home and hence accessibility for many, possibly the greatest benefit of
   the domestic garden is on human health and well-being, but further work
   is required to define this clearly within the wider context of green
   infrastructure. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Lay Summary center dot Supplemental feeding of avian species has been
   linked to beneficial, negative and neutral outcomes. Understanding the
   drivers behind these differences are important for understanding human
   impacts on avian populations as well as developing future conservation
   management plans. center dot We tracked a population of Mountain
   Chickadees from two elevations in the Sierra Nevada, USA for nine years
   and compared the breeding performance of pairs that used versus those
   that did not use feeders available throughout the winter. center dot The
   provisioning we provided is likely similar to the passive backyard
   feeding observed by many across the world but was conducted in an
   isolated natural coniferous forest environment. center dot Despite the
   robust long-term dataset and intensive reproductive monitoring, we found
   no significant differences in the reproductive performance of chickadees
   that accessed feeders and those that did not. center dot Our results add
   to the evidence that the effects of passive or targeted supplemental
   feeding are context and species dependent.
   Supplemental feeding of wild animal populations is popular across many
   areas of the world and has long been considered beneficial, especially
   to avian taxa. Over 4 billion dollars are spent by hobby bird feeders in
   the United States each year alone. However, there is mixed evidence
   whether wildlife feeding is beneficial, including when it is implemented
   as a conservation management tool, a targeted experimental design, or an
   avocation. Much of the current evidence suggests that providing
   supplemental food is advantageous to the reproductive output and general
   survival of focal taxa. However, many of these studies are limited in
   scope and duration, leaving possible negative impacts unaddressed. This
   is particularly true regarding passive backyard feeding, which describes
   the majority of supplemental feeding, including the immense effort of
   millions of public enthusiasts. Here we show that winter supplemental
   feeding prior to reproduction had no significant impact on a range of
   reproductive parameters in a resident, montane passerine species, the
   Mountain Chickadee (Poecile gambeli). This population resides in an
   intact natural environment with no exposure to supplemental food beyond
   our experimental treatments, and individual birds were tracked across
   six years using radio frequency identification technology. Our results
   add to the growing evidence that supplemental feeding alone, isolated
   from the effects of urban environments, may have little to no impact on
   the population dynamics of some avian taxa.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article is to study the functioning of the Russian
   traditional agro-industrial structure in the landscape and climatic
   conditions of the Northern Trans-Urals during the period from 1700s to
   1830s. Following L.S. Berg, we understand the landscape as ``... regular
   groupings of objects and phenomena on the land surface, on the bottom
   and on the surface of the sea (and in general reservoirs), due to the
   regular repetition of the properties and features of soils and rocky
   soils, rock formations, aquatic environment, relief, vegetation,
   wildlife, human and his material and spiritual culture aspects{''}. The
   sources of the study include economic and geographical descriptions of
   the region left by contemporaries and the office records of local
   government agencies as well.
   Due to the landscape and climatic conditions of the Northern
   Trans-Urals, arable farming in the north of the region did not go beyond
   experiments and it was sporadic in the south. At least the Berezovitsy
   and Surgutyans had vegetable gardens since the second half of the 18th
   century. As time went on, the range of plants expanded, and the truck
   farming advanced to Obdorsk. The hunter was primarily interested in
   fur-bearing animals, whose reserves were largely depleted (especially in
   the cities), but still provided the hunter with acceptable prey sizes.
   Stocks of the other fur-bearing animals, birds, fish and wild plants
   remained at a very high level. Tools, methods and timing of fishing
   activities depended on time of the year, terrain features and behavioral
   attitudes of fur-bearing animals. The fishing activity was complicated
   by the fact that the lands, except for suburban ones, had to be rented
   from the aborigines. Cattle breeding was restrained by the lack of
   hayfields, their quality (hummocks, shrubs) and the relief of floodplain
   spaces - in case of high flood, bottomland meadows went under water for
   a long time. Keeping sheep, pigs, and poultry was complicated by a huge
   number of dogs. Dogs and deer were widely used for trips through the
   taiga and tundra. The structure of handicraft lessons had been
   organically integrated into the landscape. In the 1820s, the Berezov's
   residents engaged in the deer skins manufacturing. In summer river
   transport became the only type of transport in the region. Shipbuilding
   and ship repair work required specialists - carpenters and blacksmiths.},

Abstract = {Pollinator gardening has gained momentum with an increased consumer
   interest in selecting native rather than non-native plant species to
   reduce water dependence and maximize the biodiversity value in both
   public greenspaces and residential gardens. Native plant species can
   enhance biological control and benefit ecosystems and wildlife. Often,
   they are also better-adapted to local environmental conditions,
   including temperature and rainfall, thus increasing their survival and
   reducing associated maintenance costs, primarily by requiring less
   water. Commercially available pollinator-friendly plant mixes often
   include both native and non-native species. A 2-year study was conducted
   to determine the main effects of plant provenance (native or non-native)
   and irrigation (full or partial irrigation) on landscape performance and
   flowering of 20 plants, including 10 congeneric pairs of native and
   non-native taxa that were planted in two locations (north and
   northcentral Florida). Native and non-native taxa were paired by genus
   to analyze the effect of the plant native status on vegetative and
   floral traits while controlling for variations in leaf and floral
   morphologies, growth habits, and blooming periods, which was a key and
   novel component of our study design. Represented native species included
   Spanish needles (Bidens alba), false rosemary (Conradinagrandiflora),
   tickseed coreopsis (Coreopsis leavenworthii), blanket-flower (Gaillardia
   pulchella), swamp rosemallow (Hibiscus grandiflorus), inkberry (Ilex
   glabra), spotted beebalm (Monarda punctata), azure blue sage (Salvia
   azurea), Florida scrub skullcap (Scutellaria arenicola), and Walter's
   viburnum (Viburnum obovatum). Non-native taxa paired with native
   congeners included BeedanceVR painted red bidens (Bidens ferulifolia) or
   Goldilocks RocksVR bidens (Bidens ferulifolia `BID 16101'), barbeque
   rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus `Barbeque'), Jethro Tull coreopsis
   (Coreopsis x `Jethro Tull'), Arizona sun blanket-flower (Gaillardia
   xgrandiflora `Arizona Sun'), Ruffled SatinVR rose of Sharon (Hibiscus
   syriacus `SHIMCR1'), dwarf Burford holly (Ilex cornuta `Dwarf Burford'),
   pardon my pink beebalm (Monarda didyma `Pardon My Pink'), big blue
   salvia (Salvia longispicata x S. farinacea `PAS1246577'), Malaysian
   skullcap (Scutellaria javanica), and Sandankwa viburnum (Viburnum
   suspensum). Overall, the results revealed that native plants
   outperformed non-native plants and exhibited greater survival, more
   vegetative growth, and greater floral abundance regardless of the
   irrigation treatment. Although there was no overall effect of irrigation
   on plant size or flower abundance, there were some species-specific
   responses, especially during the establishment year, and plants under
   full irrigation had greater survival in the establishment year. Thus, in
   general, the effects of plant provenance were stronger and more
   consistent across years than irrigation. Additional studies are underway
   to determine the floral rewards of these species and their attraction to
   diverse pollinators.},

Title = {Ethnobotanical biocultural diversity by rural communities in the

Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 29},
Abstract = {Background Cuatrocienegas, part of the Chihuahuan Desert, is a region of
   unique biological, geological, geographical, and evolutionary
   importance. Its current population is mestizo; nevertheless, it has high
   national historical, cultural, and touristic relevance in Mexico. It has
   been cataloged as nationally significant for its flora and fauna by
   Mexican law, as well as being designated a High Protection site by the
   World Wildlife Fund and UNESCO. Because of its diverse and complex
   biological and sociocultural characteristics, we considered it important
   to determine, identify, and analyze various aspects of the traditional
   ethnobotanical knowledge and practices in this region. Methods Between
   2016 and 2019, seven field trips were made to document the knowledge and
   use of flora. Cuatrocienegas is a protected area, collecting botanical
   material is regulated, so specimens were photographed and collected in
   neighboring communities, and in public and private gardens. Later
   permission was obtained to complete the collection of specimens
   (2019-2020). The plants were identified and entered into the flora
   database of the state of Coahuila, and deposited in the Herbarium of the
   Faculty of Forest Sciences, Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, Mexico.
   One hundred ten local residents (50 men and 60 women), aged between 27
   and 91 years, were interviewed (semi-structured interviews). The
   cultural importance of ethnobotanical resources (cultural significance
   index) and its significance with respect to ethnobotanical richness in
   other Biosphere Reserves in Mexico (Mann-Whitney test), and similarities
   in the diversity of exotic species (Sorensen index) were studied.
   Results and discussion The ethnobotanical information registers 158
   species and 132 genera in 57 vascular and non-vascular families,
   documenting a greater knowledge and use of cultivated species (84) with
   respect to wild species (74). The diversity of plants reported is
   compared to other ethnobotanical studies carried out in Mexican
   Biosphere Reserves. These results are highly relevant, in spite of
   unique exotic species. The people local pay special attention to
   medicinal and ornamental plants. The species that presented the highest
   use values are Larrea tridentata, Jatropha dioica, and Machaeranthera
   pinnatifida, three species characteristic of the desert region.
   Conclusions The particular diversity of wild flora in Cuatrocienegas
   Valley, combined with the varied introduced flora, is an important
   multifunctional resource. Special attention to introduced species is
   associated with harvesting use restrictions in the protected area as
   well as the high value of ornamental species that are difficult to
   maintain in desert areas. The extensive use of ethnobotanical knowledge
   is an example that biocultural diversity (at the conceptual level) is
   also strongly associated with socio-ecological systems incorporating
   mestizo groups and semi-urban rural landscapes, thus ceasing to be an
   exclusive focus of indigenous communities and regions.},

Abstract = {Urban areas provide small carnivores with an abundance of resources and
   reduced predation risk, resulting in higher population densities. Urban
   animals tend to have greatly reduced home range sizes in response to
   increased resource availability. We investigated the home range size of
   yellow mongoosesCynictis penicillatain an urban area and determined
   whether their home ranges overlapped with human residential areas. We
   studied the home range sizes of 8 collared and GPS tracked individuals
   in the Meyersdal Nature Area in South Africa; an area divided into two
   residential wildlife estates (4 individuals per estate): an Eco-Estate
   that was a built up residential area interspersed with natural areas;
   and a Nature Estate with reduced contact between animals and human
   residential areas. We used three methods to calculate home range size,
   namely Minimum Convex Polygon, Kernel Density Estimates and Local Convex
   Hull. Home range size was slightly larger in the Nature Estate, and male
   home ranges were larger than those of females. Compared to previous
   studies, home range sizes were considerably smaller in our study.
   Seasonal variation in home range could not be statistically compared,
   but, similar to non-urban populations, we observed smaller home range
   sizes during the breeding season (winter and spring) and larger sizes
   during the non-breeding season (autumn and summer). The overlap of home
   ranges with residential areas, and the record of multiple GPS fixes of
   tracked individuals within human residential gardens, was evident in
   both estates but to a greater extent in the Eco-Estate. Seasonal overlap
   with residential areas was greatest during autumn and winter. We showed
   that yellow mongooses modify their home ranges in response to
   urbanisation, which might be a consequence of abundant and easily
   accessible available resources, particularly during colder periods.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Conserving water in California landscapes is critical due to a limited
   water supply, recurring droughts, and the energy use and costs of
   transporting water from northern to southern California due to a water
   distribution and population imbalance. Metropolitan Water District of
   Southern California (MWD, Los Angeles, CA) spent more than \$310 million
   between 2014 and 2016 on lawn removal rebates in an effort to conserve
   residential water. In some cases, cities and local water districts
   augmented MWD rebates with their own incentives. We conducted a
   web-based study of 1153 southern Californians who removed all or a
   portion of their lawns over the past 10 years to identify their
   motivation, satisfaction, landscape water use, and related maintenance
   practices. Results indicate that rebates were less important for most
   respondents than the desire to conserve water, improve landscape
   appearance, and reduce costs. There was a high correlation between the
   overall satisfaction with the lawn replacement process and the
   appearance of transformed landscapes, supporting earlier findings
   regarding the importance consumers place on landscape appearance.
   Results of this study are timely for providing guidance to policymakers
   and water districts regarding the cost-effectiveness of lawn removal
   rebates to conserve urban water. This study also highlights a need and
   opportunity for water districts and Cooperative Extension to provide
   irrigation training to residents of stand-alone homes who maintain their
   own landscapes. While 90\% of respondents indicated they singly (78\%)

Title = {The Relationship between Knowing and Liking for 91 Urban Animal Species
   among Students},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Simple Summary People in cities have varying opinions about the animals
   around them, but there is rather little knowledge on how attitudes
   towards different urban animals compare with each other and how that
   relates to how familiar they are with them. Using self-reporting
   questionnaires, we found that students thought themselves familiar with
   most animals, and that the animals were not equally liked. While the
   more familiar animals were not also the better liked ones, we did find
   that attitudes towards familiar animals were more extreme on both the
   positive and negative sides. We suggest that more research in which
   drivers of attitudes towards many different animals can be compared is
   needed to reduce conflict between animal and human urban inhabitants.
   While there is growing consensus that nature should be promoted in
   cities, it is less clear what kind of nature this should be. One
   hypothesis is that humans show greater liking for those parts of nature
   that they know better. Using questionnaires, we studied the familiarity
   of 475 students with 91 urban animal species and the relationship
   between familiarity and attitudes towards the species. Students declared
   that they were familiar with most animals, but not all animals were
   equally liked. Better-known species were not generally the better-liked
   ones. The more familiar animal species were the more extreme attitudes
   became towards them, both positively and negatively. Our research shows
   that familiarity and attitude are not two sides of the same coin. It
   also emphasizes that there are parts of nature that are not liked by
   many humans and that this dislike is not necessarily correlated with
   insufficient knowledge. Detailed studies of what components of nature
   humans like and reasons underlying this are necessary to successfully
   increase nature in cities.},

Title = {Historical Public Parks: Investigating Contemporary Visitor Needs},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Worldwide, several large-scale historical gardens have been adapted to
   social needs and became public parks. Historical parks, designed in a
   different era and often subjected to pressures for development, raise
   concerns in meeting contemporary visitor needs, rendering them
   vulnerable to private interests. The main purpose of this paper was to
   determine whether a historical park designed in a different era can meet
   today's visitor needs. The National Garden (NG) in Athens, Greece, a
   well-protected historical park, was selected as a case study. A
   questionnaire survey addressed to the visitors of the NG was undertaken
   on the basis of the main components of park design, factors affecting
   visitation, and visitor perceptions of involvement in park management. A
   descriptive and regression analysis was applied. Even though the NG was
   not originally designed as a public park but as a garden, overall
   results showed it satisfies its visitor's needs. The planting and
   associated tranquility are the most liked characteristics of the NG that
   are inextricably linked with its original design as a private garden.
   The main qualitative traits of plants that people like were found in the
   NG plant species. Suggested improvements to fulfill further contemporary
   visitor's needs have to be considered carefully and must comply with the
   statutory measures that protect the NG and associated wildlife habitat.
   As in many urban parks, concerns for safety and cleanliness and
   willingness to volunteer in park maintenance were also expressed by
   visitors of the NG. This study illustrates that historical gardens
   designed many years ago and transformed into public parks can protect
   and conserve the historical and cultural heritage and concomitantly meet
   today's visitor needs. Further research is suggested to study other
   historical parks.},

Title = {Behavioural types and syndromes of spur-winged lapwings depend on their
   sex, body condition and urbanization score},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {212},
Pages = {183-203},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Urbanization imposes significant challenges upon wildlife worldwide,
   highlighting the need to understand how species and individuals respond
   to urban environments. Because animal behaviour is not fully plastic,
   these behavioural responses may also reflect consistent differences
   between individuals (behavioural types, BTs), or affect the covariation
   of different BTs in the population (behavioural syndromes, BSs). Here,
   we focused on the spur -winged lapwing, Vanellus spinosus, a common
   resident occupying diverse habitats. We caught breeding lapwings from
   sites throughout central and northern Israel and calculated their
   urbanization scores (built-up area around the nest). In an aviary, we
   subsequently performed three commonly used behavioural assays: (1)
   `latency to emerge', (2) `open-field' test and (3) respond to
   conspecific model. We repeated the sequence three times at weekly
   intervals. After determining that behaviours were indeed repeatable
   (i.e. they establish BTs), and reducing dimensions through principle
   component analyses, we found that the behaviours observed during both
   the `openfield' and the `response to conspecific' assays were affected
   by the interaction between an individual's sex, body condition and
   urbanization score. Lapwings from more urban areas displayed stronger
   sexdependent behaviours (with urban males being calmer in the
   `open-field' test and more tolerant of the conspecific threat compared
   to urban females). Finally, urban lapwings showed stronger BSs than
   nonurban ones, with stronger covariation between their latency to emerge
   and calmness BTs during the two subsequent assays. Overall, our study
   sheds light on the patterns of behavioural changes associated with
   urbanization, demonstrating how both the behaviours themselves (BTs) and
   their dependencies (BSs) may be influenced, while also highlighting the
   potential interaction of behavioural changes with individuals'
   physiological condition and sex. Such detailed knowledge can inform
   mitigation strategies of the issues encountered by wild animals
   inhabiting urban areas, and to understand why some species are more
   resilient to urbanization than others. (c) 2024 The Association for the

Title = {Livestock Mobility Through Integrated Beef Production-Scapes Supports
   Rangeland Livestock Production and Conservation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Much of the world's rangelands contribute to food production through
   extensive grazing systems. In these systems, livestock producers,
   pastoralists, and ranchers move grazing animals to access variable feed
   and water resources to create value while supporting numerous other
   ecosystem services. Loss of mobility due to political, social,
   ecological, and economic factors is documented throughout the world and
   poses a substantial risk to rangeland livestock production and
   conservation of rangeland resources. The integration of
   production-scapes can facilitate livestock mobility through
   transportation and trade. This paper describes the beef cattle
   production system in California, where transporting and marketing
   animals integrate an extensive grazing system with intensive production
   systems, including feeding operations. Analysis of livestock inspection
   data quantifies the magnitude of livestock movements in the state and
   the scope of production-system integration. Over 500,000 head-47 percent
   of the state's calf crop-leave California rangelands and are moved to
   new pastures or feedyards seasonally over a 12 week period each year.
   Most ranchers in California, from small-scale producers (1 to 50 head)
   to larger producers (more than 5,000), participate in the integrated
   beef production system. Less than 1\% of steers and heifers go from
   rangeland to meat processing. Like pastoralists, ranchers strategically
   move cattle around (and off) rangeland to optimize production within a
   variable climate. Ranchers indicate that their movements result from
   changes in forage quality and quantity and support their desire to
   manage for conservation objectives, including reducing fire fuels,
   controlling weeds, and managing for wildlife habitat. Inspection data,
   as well as direct observation, interviews, and surveys within the San
   Francisco Bay area, reveal the extent to which the region's ranchers
   rely on saleyards to facilitate the movement of cattle and integration
   of production systems. Saleyards and cattle buyers drive beef production
   efficiency by sorting, pricing, and moving cattle and matching them to
   feed resources in more intensive production systems. However,
   transactions lack traceability to inform policy and consumer choice. New
   data technologies like blockchain can provide traceability through
   integrated production-scapes and facilitate market development to
   support grazing landscapes and consumer choice.},

   plant-related functions at a residential area in South-eastern Australia},
Journal = {ORNITHOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Lorikeets (Psittaculidae: Loriinae) are characterised by their
   brush-like tongue used to lap nectar and gather pollen from flowers.
   Lorikeets also feed on fruits, seeds, lerps, and insects. Some species,
   such as rainbow lorikeet Trichoglossus moluccanus adapted well to urban
   and suburban areas. These lorikeets exploit flowers and fruits from
   trees and shrubs used in gardening and landscaping as food source. We
   report herein on the diversity of plant species used by rainbow
   lorikeets in a small residential suburban area in South-eastern
   Australia. We found that the lorikeets use 20 plant species as sources
   of nectar and/or pollen, fruits, and seeds. While visiting the diverse
   flowers, pollen adhered to different parts of the lorikeets' body, the
   birds acting as potential pollinators. In the case of figs, the
   lorikeets ate both the fleshy portions and seeds, acting as seed
   predators. When the minute fruits adhered to the birds' bill and chin or
   were swallowed along with the pulp, the lorikeets acted as potential
   dispersers. Seed predation also occurred when the birds extracted seeds
   from she-oak and grass fruits. On night-blooming plants, the lorikeets
   acted mostly as supplementary pollinators, flying foxes being the main
   pollinators. The lorikeets retained their functions as potential
   pollinators and dispersers, and delivered ecosystem services even within
   a highly human-modified environment. Our suggestion about the diurnal
   lorikeet's role as an auxiliary pollinator of night-blooming plants
   pollinated by mammals, and its role as main pollinator where or when
   these mammals (mostly flying foxes) are missing, would also be played by
   other bird species such as honeyeaters (Meliphagidae).},

Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Developed landscapes in urban and peri-urban environments significantly
   influence the diversity, abundance, and overall health of pollinator
   populations such as bees, butterflies, moths, and birds. Considering
   growing evidence demonstrating that pollinator health can be more robust
   in urban habitats than rural ones, the landscape development and
   management practices adopted in urban and suburban areas have a
   significant potential impact on pollinator health. Given their influence
   with respect to urban and suburban landscape management in Florida, it
   is critical to better understand the knowledge, attitudes, and
   perceptions of Florida residents regarding pollinator-friendly gardening
   practices such as the flowering plant installation or reduced pesticide
   application. To explore the most salient factors influencing residents'
   adoption of pollinator gardening practices, we facilitated three
   elicitation focus groups with 20 residents representing three distinct
   regions in Florida. Data analysis generated a series of salient
   sub-themes across two thematic categories: `barriers' and `solutions and
   strategies'. Major `barrier' themes included `limited knowledge or
   information access' about pollinator gardening, and `social
   norms/community expectations'. Major solution and strategy' themes
   included `developing neighborhood/homeowner association buy-in,' and
   `pre-installation research and planning'. Overall, findings demonstrate
   that Florida residents have strong views regarding both the most
   influential barriers to adopting or engaging in pollinator-friendly
   gardening and the most promising solutions or strategies to mitigate
   those barriers. These findings have tangible implications for
   educational practitioners interested in expanding distribution of
   targeted educational outreach to further promote the adoption of
   pollinator-friendly landscape management practices in Florida. Findings
   also have implications for researchers interested in further examining
   the socio-economic and socio-cultural factors most influential to
   residents' pollinator gardening practices.},

Volume = {232},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Residential property certification schemes can inform and incentivise
   householders to enhance native biodi-versity in their urban properties,
   but the certification process requires the development of a robust
   biodiversity evaluation tool. We used a modified Delphi process and
   conjoint analysis to identify and rank features associated with
   biodiversity to produce a tool to evaluate residential property
   biodiversity. We evaluated its performance in 89 residential properties
   in South Island, New Zealand. Property sizes assessed ranged from 260 m2
   to 7195 m2. Biodiversity scores ranged between 10 and 52 out of a
   possible 100, indicating the challenge of obtaining a score higher than
   about 60. The relationship between property size and biodiversity score
   was positive but variable, however all properties < 500 m2 had scores
   lower than 30, suggesting a need for a size-specific rating system for
   smaller properties. Trained assessors evaluated properties in 1-2 h,
   with an additional hour required for col-lecting information online and
   performing calculations. Similar scores derived by a second assessor for
   seventeen properties (one year later) indicated that the method yields a
   repeatable score independent of assessor. Property assessment scores
   could be converted to a star rating system and used in various
   circumstances. A Residential Property Star rating system could be
   adopted by local government, housing developers, or community groups and
   NGOs, for example, to incentivise homeowners to enhance and sustain
   backyard biodiversity, to track trends in urban biodiversity, and to
   help meet regional and national biodiversity strategic goals.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Urbanization is presenting a growing problem for biodiversity
   conservation, notably by increasingly isolating over half of the world's
   population from the experience of nature. This separation of people from
   nature is an important environmental issue, as it could fundamentally
   influence the way people value nature and their willingness to conserve
   it. Here we provide the first experimental study that jointly explores
   how urban biodiversity can be enhanced and how these changes may
   influence some aspects of people-biodiversity interactions.
   We significantly increased the diversity of flowers, birds and
   pollinators in small public gardens (Paris, France) by providing
   additional resources (i.e., planting flower-meadows and placing
   nesting-boxes). Semi-structured interviews were conducted in situ with
   1116 regular garden users before and after the manipulation. Close-ended
   questionnaires were completed exploring the respondents' biodiversity
   perception and their sensitivity to the changes in biodiversity. Our
   results highlight a people-biodiversity paradox between people's
   perceptions and biodiversity awareness. Respondents expressed a strong
   preference for a rich diversity of species (excluding insects) and
   related this diversity to their well-being in the gardens. However, they
   did not notice the diversity of species. Respondents underestimated
   species richness and only noticed the changes in native flower richness
   in those gardens where advertisement and public involvement were
   organized. More experimental interdisciplinary studies are needed to
   further explore the people-biodiversity interactions. This would help
   expose the role that urban biodiversity plays in people's daily life and
   the importance of this interaction for raising public support for
   general conservation policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Currently, slightly less than half the world's population lives in dense
   urban areas, principally cities. In Australia, nearly 85\% of people
   live in towns with 1000 or more residents. Although individual species
   of urban flora and fauna have often been well studied, little is known
   of the long-term temporal patterns associated with changes in both the
   abiotic and biotic environments as urban systems expand. Using
   historical and current information, the changes in species richness
   (defined as the native and introduced vertebrates and vascular plants)
   in Adelaide, South Australia, are described from its founding in 1836
   until 2002. Adelaide is an isolated city of over a million inhabitants,
   bordered by a range of hills and the South Australian coastline. With a
   Mediterranean climate, a culture that places high importance on private
   residential gardens, and the presence of extensive public parklands, the
   metropolitan area has a. significant diversity of both native and
   introduced flora and fauna. Using only the presence or absence of a
   species, the changes to plant and vertebrate species richness were
   quantified by analyzing the observed patterns of change at a functional
   group level. Powerful correlative evidence is provided to explain the
   development and establishment of patterns in urban ecology.
   There has been a dramatic change in species composition, with an
   increase in total species numbers of similar to30\%. At least 132 native
   species of plants and animals have become locally extinct, and a minimum
   of 648 introduced species have arrived (mostly plants). The plants
   increased in species richness by 46\%. Fifty percent of the native
   mammal species were lost, and overall, the birds declined by one
   species, representing 21 extinctions and 20 successful introductions.
   Amphibians and reptiles showed no net change. The herbaceous perennial
   and annual plant species richness showed a substantial increase. This
   temporal approach to urban ecology demonstrates new ways to identify
   individual species or groups at risk of extinction and provides some
   long-term management goals for large urban areas.},

Title = {A taxonomically detailed and large-scale view of the factors affecting
   the distribution and abundance of tree species planted in private
   gardens of Christchurch city, New Zealand},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {A city's planted trees, the great majority of which are in private
   gardens, play a fundamental role in shaping a city's wild ecology,
   ecosystem functioning, and ecosystem services. However, studying tree
   diversity across a city's many thousands of separate private gardens is
   logistically challenging. After the disastrous 2010-2011 earthquakes in
   Christchurch, New Zealand, over 7,000 homes were abandoned and a
   botanical survey of these gardens was contracted by the Government's
   Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) prior to buildings being
   demolished. This unprecedented access to private gardens across the
   443.9 hectares `Residential Red Zone' area of eastern Christchurch is a
   unique opportunity to explore the composition of trees in private
   gardens across a large area of a New Zealand city. We analysed these
   survey data to describe the effects of housing age, socio-economics,
   human population density, and general soil quality, on tree abundance,
   species richness, and the proportion of indigenous and exotic species.
   We found that while most of the tree species were exotic, about half of
   the individual trees were local native species. There is an increasing
   realisation of the native tree species values among Christchurch
   citizens and gardens in more recent areas of housing had a higher
   proportion of smaller/younger native trees. However, the same sites had
   proportionately more exotic trees, by species and individuals, amongst
   their larger planted trees than older areas of housing. The majority of
   the species, and individuals, of the larger (>= 10 cm DBH) trees planted
   in gardens still tend to be exotic species. In newer suburbs, gardens in
   wealthy areas had more native trees than gardens from poorer areas,
   while in older suburbs, poorer areas had more native big trees than
   wealthy areas. In combination, these describe, in detail unparalleled
   for at least in New Zealand, how the tree infrastructure of the city
   varies in space and time. This lays the groundwork for better
   understanding of how wildlife distribution and abundance, wild plant
   regeneration, and ecosystem services, are affected by the city's trees.},

   mental health problems, are unemployed or bereaved, or have been in
   trouble with the law can be socially marginalized and can become
   isolated from their families, community and wider society. This paper
   explores the role of active hands-on contact with the environment
   through a general environmental volunteering programme and through a
   targeted therapeutic volunteer programme, highlighting how these two
   approaches can potentially aid some marginalized people to reintegrate
   into society.
   Methods: This study draws on concepts from the well-being and social
   capital literatures and refers to two separate pieces of research: Study
   1 was based on general environmental volunteering primarily in northern
   England and southern Scotland; and Study 2 focused on mental health
   participants at Meanwhile Wildlife Garden in London. Ethnographic and
   interview data were gathered from participants as a means to understand
   the benefits they gained from their voluntary involvement. The
   participants all volunteered to undertake the activities they were
   involved in and chose outdoor nature activity as opposed to other
   activities.
   Results: There is self-reported and observed evidence from and of
   participants in these studies that contact with nature can be beneficial
   to a range of excluded groups; also the studies show that the learning
   and curative processes that take place in green spaces can provide
   benefits in terms of social reintegration of vulnerable young people and
   adults. Three key themes of particular relevance to the marginalized
   participants were identified as: (1) improving relations with others and
   nature; (2) working alongside others who are different; and (3)
   developing social and employable skills. Active hands-on engagement
   allows people to work at their own pace, since these approaches are not
   target focused, and skills and social networks can be developed slowly.
   Practical engagement in environmental conservation work is one approach
   that may provide people with a new role, identity, skills and social
   networks. This paper argues that volunteering in nature has the
   potential to provide a shared purpose for people, independent of gender,
   age, physical ability, mental functioning, socioeconomic status or
   knowledge of environmental management. However, it is recognized that
   particular people may and do experience barriers to engaging with and
   enjoying the natural environment.
   Conclusions: Volunteering in nature may be particularly effective for
   those who would like to be outdoors and have more contact with nature
   yet need specific encouragement and supported/led activities to
   participate.},

Abstract = {Managing non-native species in cities is often controversial because
   these species can support both ecosystem services and disservices. Yet,
   how the acceptability of non-native species management by the general
   public differs in relation to native species, to distance (i.e. close to
   residence and elsewhere) and among plants and animals is understudied.
   Furthermore, while values, beliefs and knowledge are often considered in
   this context, psychometric factors such as emotions and anthropomorphic
   views have received little attention. We surveyed 658 residents in
   Berlin, Germany, to assess (i) the acceptability of management actions
   differing in their severity for non-native plants and animals compared
   to native species with similar traits, (ii) the influence of perceived
   distance of species (i.e. close to residence and elsewhere) and (iii)
   the predictive potential of psychometric (i.e. values, beliefs,
   self-assessed knowledge, emotions and anthropomorphism) and
   socio-demographic factors for this acceptability. Eradication (i.e.
   lethal control/removal) was generally the least accepted management
   action, but more accepted for non-native than native species. Distance
   mattered for the acceptability of non-native plant management with
   unspecified control action the most accepted management action close to
   residence. While values (self-transcendence and conservation) mostly
   explained the acceptability of doing nothing and eradication, emotions
   related strongly to all management actions. Beliefs were more important
   than self-assessed knowledge in relation to non-native species
   management and beliefs about non-native plants and animals were rated
   almost similar. Anthropomorphic views had predictive potential for
   plants and animals; that is, the stronger people held anthropomorphic
   views, the less they accepted eradication. Participants with a garden
   supported doing nothing with plants (native and non-native) more than
   without. Results highlight the complexity of factors underlying the
   acceptability of management actions on species in cities. While values,
   beliefs and self-assessed knowledge are important in the context of
   species management, other psychometric factors add to our understanding
   of acceptability. We conclude that awareness about different
   acceptability patterns related to species management can support
   environmental policies on biological invasions in cities. Tailoring and
   implementing adequate management actions can benefit from incorporating
   cognitive but also affective factors of the public. Read the free Plain

Title = {Boundaries in ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and environmental
   variables at the edges of forest patches with residential developments},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Background. Few studies of edge effects on wildlife objectively identify
   habitat edges or explore non-linear responses. In this paper, we build
   on ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) research that has begun to
   address these domains by using triangulation wombling to identify
   boundaries in beetle community structure and composition at the edges of
   forest patches with residential developments. We hypothesized that edges
   are characterized by boundaries in environmental variables that
   correspond to marked discontinuities in vegetation structure between
   maintained yards and forest. We expected environmental boundaries to be
   associated with beetle boundaries.
   Methods. We collected beetles and measured environmental variables in
   200 m by 200 m sampling grids centered at the edges of three forest
   patches, each with a rural, suburban, or urban context, in Charlotte,
   North Carolina, USA. We identified boundaries within each grid at two
   spatial scales and tested their significance and overlap using boundary
   statistics and overlap statistics, respectively. We complemented
   boundary delineation with k-means clustering.
   Results. Boundaries in environmental variables, such as temperature,
   grass cover, and leaf litter depth, occurred at or near the edges of all
   three sites, in many cases at both scales. The beetle variables that
   exhibited the most pronounced boundary structure in relation to edges
   were total species evenness, generalist abundance, generalist richness,
   generalist evenness, and Agonum punctiforme abundance. Environmental and
   beetle boundaries also occurred within forest patches and residential
   developments, indicating substantial localized spatial variation on
   either side of edges. Boundaries in beetle and environmental variables
   that displayed boundary structure at edges significantly overlapped, as
   did boundaries on either side of edges. The comparison of boundaries and
   clusters revealed that boundaries formed parts of the borders of patches
   of similar beetle or environmental condition.
   Discussion. We show that edge effects on ground beetle community
   structure and composition and environmental variation at the
   intersection of forest patches and residential developments can be
   described by boundaries and that these boundaries overlap in space.
   However, our results also highlight the complexity of edge effects in
   our system: environmental boundaries were located at or near edges
   whereas beetle boundaries related to edges could be spatially disjunct
   from them; boundaries incompletely delineated edges such that only parts
   of edges were well-described by sharp transitions in beetle and/or
   environmental variables; and the occurrence of boundaries related to
   edges was apparently influenced by individual property management
   practices, site-specific characteristics such as development geometry,
   and spatial scale.},

Title = {Assessing Changes in Land Use/Land Cover and Ecological Risk to Conserve
   Protected Areas in Urban-Rural Contexts},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Land use/land cover (LULC) changes in response to natural factors and
   human activities constitute a pressing issue for the conservation of
   Protected Areas in urban-rural landscapes. The present study
   investigated LULC changes in the Jajrud Protected Area (JPA) and the
   Kavdeh Wildlife Refuge (KWR) in the Tehran province, Iran, between 1989
   and 2019. To inform ecological conservation measures for the JPA and
   KWR, LULC changes were identified and monitored using Landsat imagery
   from between 1989 and 2019. In addition, the landscape ecological risk
   (ER) was evaluated by conducting a landscape pattern index analysis.
   Then, the importance of different indicators affected by ER in these two
   PAs was assessed using the Delphi method, and expert opinions were
   solicited through a questionnaire. As for LULC changes in the JPA,
   high-density pasture declined the most over 1989-2019, from 38.6\%
   (29,241 ha) to 37.7\% (28,540 ha). In contrast, built-up areas increased
   the most, from 10.4\% (7895 ha) in 1989 to 11.9\% (9048 ha) in 2019.
   Water bodies also increased, from 0.88\% (676 ha) in 1989 to 0.94\% (715
   ha) in 2019. In the KWR, cropland and gardens increased the most, from
   2.14\% (1647 ha) in 1989 to 3.4\% (2606 ha) in 2019. Built-up areas also
   increased, from 0.05\% (45 ha) in 1989 to 0.09\% (75 ha) in 2019. Water
   bodies increased from 0.69\% (538 ha) in 1989 to 0.71\% (552 ha) in
   2019. Finally, high-density pasture decreased the most, from 29.4\%
   (22,603 ha) in 1989 to 28.5\% (21,955 ha) in 2019. At the same time, the
   high and very high ER classes increased, more so in the JPA compared to
   the KWR. Finally, considering both LULC and ER changes, the Delphi
   method demonstrated that the greatest impacts occurred in the JPA.
   Various illegal economic and physical activities have created LULC
   changes and caused extensive destruction of ecosystems, posing a high ER
   in the study areas. The intensity of ER differs between the two PAs
   because of the varying distance from the metropolis, varying degrees of
   human activities, LULC changes, along with differences in legal
   restrictions of use. Aligned with the management plans of these areas,
   our research shows that it is necessary to develop land only within the
   designated zones to minimize the amount of ER. Various models of LULC
   changes have been presented, and a comparison of these models relating
   to the methodology and model effectiveness can help increase their
   accuracy and power of interpretation.},

   biodiversity and conservation values of urban residential and public
   woodlands, Christchurch},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {149-162},
Abstract = {Urban forests are increasingly valued for multiple benefits such as
   amenity, cultural values, native biodiversity, ecosystem services, and
   carbon sequestration. Urban biodiversity in particular, is the new focus
   although global homogenisation is undermining regional differentiation.
   In the northern hemisphere (e.g., Canada and USA) and in the southern
   hemisphere, particularly in countries like South Africa, Australia,
   South America and New Zealand, local biodiversity is further impacted by
   historical colonisation from Europe. After several centuries, urban
   forests are now composed of synthetic and spontaneous mixtures of native
   species, and exotic species from around the temperate world (e.g.,
   Europe, North and South America, South Africa, Asia). As far as we are
   aware no-one has carried out in-depth study of these synthetic forests
   in any Southern Hemisphere city. Here we describe the composition,
   structure, and biodiversity conservation imperatives of urban temperate
   forests at 90 random locations in Christchurch city, New Zealand.
   We document considerable plant diversity; the total number of species
   encountered in the 253 sampled urban forest patches was 486. Despite
   this incredibly variable data set, our ability to explain variation in
   species richness was surprisingly good and clearly indicates that total
   species richness was higher in larger patches with greater litter and
   vegetation cover, and taller canopy height. Species richness was also
   higher in patches surrounded by higher population densities and closer
   to very large native forest patches. Native species richness was higher
   in patches with higher soil pH, lower canopy height, and greater litter
   cover and in patches closer to very large native forest patches
   indicating dispersal out of native areas and into gardens. Eight
   distinct forest communities were identified by Two-Way INdicator SPecies
   ANalysis (TWINSPAN) using the occurrence of 241 species that occurred in
   more than two out of all 253 forest patches.
   Christchurch urban forest canopies were dominated by exotic tree species
   in parklands and in street tree plantings (linear parkland). Native tree
   and shrub species were not as common in public spaces but their overall
   density high in residential gardens. There was some explanatory power in
   our data, since less deprivation resulted in greater diversity and
   density, and more native species, which in turn is associated with
   private ownership. We hypothesise that a number of other factors, which
   were not well reflected in our measured environmental variables, are
   responsible for much of the remaining variation in the plant community
   structure, e.g., advertising, peoples choice. For a more sustainable
   asset base of native trees in New Zealand cities we need more,
   longer-lived native species, in large public spaces, including a greater
   proportion of species that bear fruit and nectar suitable for native
   wildlife. We may then achieve cities with ecological integrity that
   present multiple historical dimensions, and sequester carbon in legible
   landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Wild bees are experiencing population declines globally. Despite
   urbanisation replacing habitat and forage with synthetic materials,
   urban residential gardens have the potential to become pollinator
   hotspots, increasing bee diversity and abundance. We explored public
   knowledge and attitudes towards bees, and `bee-friendly' interventions
   (BFIs) conducted by urban residents. We reviewed the motivations and
   barriers which influence or prevent this, using the town of Woking,
   England, as a case study. An online questionnaire was distributed in
   2023 to residents with gardens or balconies. Results from 286 surveys
   showed 98.3\% of respondents performed >= 1 BFI and the most common
   action was planting ``pollinator-friendly{''} plants (75.9\%). Sentiment
   towards bees positively correlated to the number of BFIs performed, and
   94.8\% of respondents felt positively about bees. Most participants
   indicated altruistic motivations behind their performance of
   BFIs.Implications for insect conservation: Though the public are
   altruistically motivated to undertake conservation for wild bees, and
   most are performing at least one BFI, lack of knowledge and
   understanding is the biggest barrier preventing conservation action.
   Governments, policymakers, and plant retailers should direct citizens to
   wild bee conservation organisations to engage and inform the public
   about bee ecology and improve habitat provision within neighbourhoods.},

Abstract = {Land management can occur at very small scales, such as in individual
   home gardens, and at very large scales, such as at the municipal scale
   or beyond. The scale of management can affect environmental
   heterogeneity and thus can affect biodiversity at alpha, beta, and gamma
   scales. Urban areas provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects
   of large- versus small-scale land management on different scales of
   biodiversity. We surveyed floral resources and bees in residential
   backyards and powerline corridors in the Chicago suburbs, with yards
   representing small-scale management and powerline corridors representing
   large-scale management. We calculated alpha diversity, beta diversity,
   and gamma diversity for both floral and bee species. We also determined
   absolute nestedness for corridors and neighborhoods to gain further
   insight into effects of management on species composition. We found that
   beta diversity for both floral resources and bees was highest in
   response to small-scale yard management and its creation of
   heterogeneous landscapes, while alpha and gamma diversity patterns were
   less clear. We also found that the floral resource and bee communities
   demonstrated absolute nestedness in both powerline corridors and
   residential neighborhoods, respectively. Our results indicate that taxa
   may respond to the effects of management scale differently owing to
   variation in their mobility or resource requirements. Our study results
   demonstrate that suburban residential areas may be prime targets for
   biodiversity conservation due to their environmental heterogeneity.},

Title = {Determinants of willingness to add pollinator beneficial plants to
   residential yards differ by plant type},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {370},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Yards (i.e. residential gardens) can provide suitable food and refuge
   for a variety of pollinators, but residents' decisions to make such
   changes to their yards depend on socio-economic characteristics of
   residents, their lifestyle and life stage, perceived or existing social
   norms surrounding yard appearance and associated care, as well as yard
   characteristics such as yard size and characteristics of the plants
   themselves. In this study, we randomly selected properties in two
   counties in southwestern Ohio along two gradients: parcel size and
   parcel valuation (as proxies for urbanization and income gradients,
   respectively). Two hundred surveys were deployed asking residents about
   their yard management practices, and their willingness to plant three
   pollinator beneficial plants (Asclepias syriaca, Echinacea purpurea, and
   wildflowers (multiple spp.)). One hundred and thirteen surveys were
   returned (57\% response rate). For residents who did not have the
   aforementioned plants in their yards at the time of the survey, i.e.
   nearly two-thirds of the respondents, we used random forest models to
   uncover determinants of willingness to add the native plants shown in
   the survey in residential yards. Overall, this subpopulation is
   unwilling to add the plants shown in the survey, especially if they like
   to keep their backyards neat and tidy. However, differences exist
   regarding the key explanatory variables of the willingness to plant A.
   syriaca compared to the other plant types shown in the survey. For A.
   syriaca property value is not an important explanatory variable but not
   growing hay and enjoying mowing are associated with stronger willingness
   to plant A syriaca. For the other native plant types, lower income
   residents were the least willing to plant them suggesting they might not
   have the capacity to do so and/or are strongly wanting to adhere to
   traditional yard aesthetics. The highest income residents were also less
   willing to add these plants. These findings suggest that approaching
   homeowners to convert land to native plants should take different tacks
   for different native plants. For example, to attempt to convince
   midwestern residents to plant A. syriaca, we suggest focusing on more
   rural households and properties where hay is not grown. Together, our
   results indicate that this coupled human-natural system is strongly
   influenced by a variety of variables that support the ``ecology of
   prestige{''} theory (Grove et al., 2014) and that the potential for
   voluntarily erecting pollinator beneficial plantings on private lands
   where they are currently absent might be rather limited.},

Abstract = {Diazinon is a non -systemic organophosphorus insecticide formerly used
   to control cockroaches, ants and other insects as well as fleas in
   residential, non-food premises. Diazinon was used extensively in the
   1970s and early 1980s for general gardening and indoor pest control. One
   form of bait has been used to control scavenger wasps in the western US.
   Diazinon is used in flea collars for domestic animals in Australia and
   New Zealand. Unauthorized uses of diazinon were banned in the US in 2004
   due to risks to human health, but it is still approved for agricultural
   uses. An emergency antidote is atropine. During the years 2022-2023,
   several cases of diazinon poisoning in birds were identified within the
   surface of Bucharest, the most important of which was the death of
   approximately 50 wild pigeons (Columba livia). Following the laboratory
   examinations represented by necropsy examination, histopathological
   examination and toxicological examinations, the chemical compound
   diazinon was identified in the gastric contents. This insecticide is
   still used in Romania for the insect control actions organized by the
   authorities, especially in the warm season to control insects (flies,
   mosquitoes) in parks and green spaces, being spread by vaporization and
   sprinkling. It is also sold in veterinary pharmacies and phyto-sanitary
   stores, and can be used in one's own household, but with great caution
   regarding the animals in the targeted area. Given its widespread use,
   diazinon is a frequent cause of accidental poisoning in birds in
   particular, but also in mammals.},

   population density were associated with non-eusocial native bee species,
   eusocial bees (Apis mellifera and Tetragonula spp.), and hoverflies, in
   residential green spaces of the subtropical city Brisbane, Australia. We
   found that associations between bee abundance and vegetation cover were
   moderated by human density, but the direction of this effect differed
   for non-eusocial and eusocial species. Non-eusocial bee abundance was
   positively associated with tree cover at local and landscape scales when
   human densities were low, but negatively so at high human population
   densities. We suggest this may be because the quality of vegetation for
   non-eusocial bees deteriorates as human density increases. In contrast,
   abundance of eusocial bees was negatively associated with increasing
   local cover of grass and shrubs at low levels of human density, but
   positively associated at high densities. This affinity to humans could
   partly be explained by domesticated ``kept{''} hives. We found no effect
   of urban gradients on bee species richness. Hoverfly abundance was
   negatively related to human density and positively related to vegetation
   cover at local and landscape scales. At the backyard scale, both bee
   species richness and bee and hoverfly abundances were positively
   associated to flower abundance. Backyards with more vegetation cover had
   higher densities of non-eusocial bees. Our results thus support the idea
   that urban greening in densely populated areas at multiple spatial
   scales can benefit a range of insect pollinators.},

Title = {Powerline Corridors Can Add Ecological Value to Suburban Landscapes When
   Not Maintained as Lawn},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Electric powerline corridors are informal green spaces that encompass
   large areas of land and have the potential to support biodiversity in
   urban and suburban landscapes. However, the extent to which these
   corridors provide novel habitats compared to the surrounding landscape
   is unclear. Biodiversity in corridors is often compared to that of
   ``natural{''} habitats despite the fact that the corridors are subject
   to frequent vegetation management. In urban and suburban landscapes,
   residential yards may provide a more appropriate comparison because they
   are a dominant type of green space and are also characterized by
   frequent vegetation management. We conducted a study of the biodiversity
   in suburban powerline corridors in northern Illinois, USA, and compared
   it to the biodiversity found in nearby residential yards. Our goal was
   to determine whether powerline corridors added ecological value to these
   suburban landscapes. We included three different management styles of
   powerline corridors: (1) frequently mowed and kept as lawn, (2) brush
   mowed on a five-year cycle ({''}old-field{''}), and (3) restored and/or
   maintained as native prairie. We measured the species richness and
   composition of plants, birds, and insect pollinators in corridors and
   yards. The corridor management types and comparison yards differed
   significantly in the richness of all three taxa, with old-field and/or
   prairie sites having greater species richness than mown corridors and/or
   comparison yards. Community composition also differed by management
   category. While the species richness of old-field sites tended to be
   high, prairie sites generally had more species of conservation interest.
   Our study shows that both old-field- and prairie-managed powerline
   corridors add habitat value to Midwestern U.S. suburban landscapes by
   providing alternative habitat types that support many species.
   Nonetheless, we suggest that managers looking to specifically support
   native and/or grassland specialist species in this region should manage
   sites as prairies when possible.},

   Norms to Support Pollinator Populations},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Insect pollinator populations, critical to the global food supply, are
   declining. Research has found robust bee communities in cities, which
   are supported by diverse urban habitat and foraging resources.
   Accounting for 35-50\% of urban green space, U.S. private residential
   yards can serve as important forage and nesting sources for pollinators.
   Incorporating wild attributes and wildness, such as native vegetation
   and less intensive yard-management practices, is key. However, urban
   vegetation, and its effects on local native bee populations, is shaped
   by social and cultural preferences, norms, aesthetics, values, and
   identities. The perfect lawn ideal of a highly manicured turfgrass yard
   dominates neighborhood landscapes and is often at odds with the habitat
   needs of pollinators. As part of a three-year study investigating the
   sociocultural drivers of residential vegetation choices in St. Louis,
   MO, USA, we interviewed 85 decisionmakers in order to understand choices
   about private residential yard maintenance. This paper presents an
   emergent finding concerning how residents conceptualize and talk about
   the urban-yard aesthetic, using the terms ``wild `` and ``wildness ``,
   which reflect a range of levels in the demand for urban wild spaces in
   their neighborhoods. The discourse of wildness offers a nontechnical
   route for understanding the connections between the ecological
   consequences of urbanization, with human attitudes towards nature that
   shape the biological functioning of human-generated habitats.},

Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Many species have become locally extinct because of
   urbanization. However, many thrive in urban areas because they
   originally have, or they have acquired, features that enable them to
   exploit urban areas. We studied the ecology of the urban yellow
   mongoose, a recent urban dweller in parts of South Africa. We
   investigated the diet, space use and activity habits of yellow
   mongooses, and whether they exploit residential gardens. Similar to
   their non-urban counterparts, yellow mongooses in urban areas fed on
   insects, particularly in spring/summer. The presence of human food
   items, small mammals and birds in scats increased during autumn/winter,
   when insects are known to be less abundant. Camera trap footage revealed
   that, similar to their non-urban counterparts, yellow mongooses in urban
   areas were more prevalent in open habitats, and showed an early morning,
   late afternoon diurnal activity pattern. These urban mongooses were more
   frequently near human residences than at sites further away. Their home
   range size was considerably smaller than that of non-urban mongooses and
   overlapped more with human residents during autumn/winter than during
   spring/summer. Overall, the urban yellow mongooses displayed
   characteristics similar to non-urban mongooses, particularly in their
   diet, habitat use and activity patterns. Yet, they modified their diet
   by including human food, occurred in gardens, and had smaller home
   ranges, indicating modifications for urban life. Several species are
   negatively impacted by urbanization, while others thrive in urban areas
   by exploiting anthropogenic habitats matching their pre-existing niche
   preferences, or by modifying their behavior for urban life. We studied
   the ecology of a recent urban resident, the yellow mongoose, in an urban
   ecological estate in South Africa. We assessed urban dwelling yellow
   mongooses' diet, spatial and temporal occurrence, home range size, and
   whenever possible, compared our findings to the published literature on
   their non-urban conspecifics. Additionally, we evaluated occurrence
   overlap with residential gardens. Similar to their non-urban
   counterparts, scat analyses revealed that yellow mongooses in urban
   areas fed mainly on insects, particularly during spring/summer. In the
   colder months, anthropogenic items, small mammals and birds in scats
   increased. Camera trap surveys showed that the mongooses were common in
   open habitats, similar to previous studies, and exhibited a
   species-typical bimodal diurnal activity pattern. The occurrence of
   these mongooses was greater near human residences than at sites further
   away. Home range sizes were considerably smaller than those of non-urban
   mongoose. Mongoose occurred in residential gardens, more so during the
   colder months. The urban yellow mongooses' diet, habitat preference and
   activity patterns were similar to non-urban conspecifics. Nonetheless,
   the exploitation of anthropogenic food sources, occurrence in
   residential gardens and smaller home range sizes showed that they
   respond flexibly to urbanization, and these modifications might aid in
   their success in urban areas.},

Abstract = {In the United States, residential yards are typically overlooked for
   biodiversity conservation, yet they account for a significant portion of
   urban green space. Yard vegetation can serve as valuable habitat patches
   for insect pollinator populations in cities, providing important
   foraging and nesting resources. Based on long-term native bee sampling
   data, we investigate the social and cultural drivers shaping front yard
   vegetation composition and configuration at two study sites with
   consistently low native bee species diversity and abundance. We employ
   quantitative remote sensing approaches with analysis of qualitative
   interview data to examine residential vegetation patterns and analyze
   the socio-cultural relationships between people and vegetation. Data
   analyses reveal both study sites have lower levels of vegetation
   composition and complexity, resulting in reduced habitat resources. We
   find neighborhood public-facing landscaping is shaped by various
   socio-cultural influences: aesthetics, norms, reference-group behavior,
   institutions, socioeconomics, and identity. Front yard land-use and
   decision-making practices are particularly meaning laden, as these
   spaces are often perceived as visible representations of longstanding
   neighborhood identity and contiguous common areas to be managed to a
   perfect lawn ideal. The quantitative and qualitative data are used to
   characterize the two study sites and inform future urban conservation

Abstract = {Native landscaping has been proposed as a means of increasing native
   bird diversity and abundance in urban landscapes. However residents'
   preferences for vegetation are such that exotic plants are often
   preferred over natives. We investigated the extent to which native birds
   foraged in three common native and three exotic tree species in mixed
   urban woodland during four seasons. We predicted that native birds would
   spend more time foraging in native trees, and that food resources
   provided by deciduous exotic trees would be more seasonal than those
   provided by non-deciduous natives. Native birds spent a lot of time
   foraging in two of the native tree species, but very little time in
   native red beech (Nothofagus fusca). They used exotic oak (Quercus
   robur) throughout the year, and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus)
   seasonally. Oak and European beech (Fagus sylvatica) were used by the
   largest number of species overall, because they attracted both native
   and exotic birds. With the exception of tree fuchsia (Fuschia
   excorticata), which produces large volumes of nectar followed by fruits,
   all tree species were sources of invertebrates for insectivorous
   feeding. Seasonality of use was high only in sycamore, indicating
   limited support for our second prediction. We show that being native
   doesn't necessarily entail being a good food source for native birds,
   and popular landscaping exotic species, such as oak, provide foraging
   opportunities across all seasons.},

Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {819-833},

Abstract = {Urban gardens provide a rich habitat for species that are declining in
   rural areas. However, collecting data in gardens can be
   logistically-challenging, time-consuming and intrusive to residents.
   This study examines the potential of citizen scientists to record
   hedgehog sightings and collect habitat data within their own gardens
   using an online questionnaire. Focussing on a charismatic species meant
   that the number of responses was high (516 responses were obtained in
   six weeks, with a similar to 50:50 \% split between gardens with and
   without hedgehog sightings). While many factors commonly thought to
   influence hedgehog presence (e.g. compost heaps) were present in many
   hedgehog-frequented gardens, they were not discriminatory as they were
   also found in gardens where hedgehogs were not seen. Respondents were
   most likely to have seen hedgehogs in their garden if they had also seen
   hedgehogs elsewhere in their neighbourhood. However, primary fieldwork
   using hedgehog `footprint tunnels' showed that hedgehogs were found to
   be just as prevalent in gardens in which hedgehogs had previously been
   reported as gardens where they had not been reported. Combining these
   results indicates that hedgehogs may be more common in urban and
   semi-urban gardens than previously believed, and that casual volunteer
   records of hedgehogs may be influenced more by the observer than by
   habitat preferences of the animal. When verified, volunteer records can
   provide useful information, but care is needed in interpreting these
   data.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to describe the residential use of insecticides in a
   birth cohort in Spain. Study subjects were 2 456 women enrolled into the
   INMA (Environment and Childhood) birth cohort followed prospectively
   during pregnancy and in the early postnatal period. The women were
   recruited at the beginning of their pregnancy between 2003 and 2008 in
   four regions of Spain. Socio-demographic, environmental and lifestyle
   information was obtained at two interviews during pregnancy, one at the
   first (mean:13.8 +/- 2.6 weeks of gestation) and the other at the third
   trimester (mean: 33.3 +/- 23 weeks of gestation). Information about
   prenatal use of indoor and outdoor insecticides (type, timing, place of
   application, place of storage) was obtained from the second interview.
   In a 3rd interview (mean: 16.2 +/- 6.9 months of age of children),
   information about postnatal indoor and outdoor insecticide use was
   obtained. Regression models examined the association between demographic
   and lifestyle factors and pesticide use to determine which
   characteristics predicted use prenatally and postnatally. Fifty-four
   percent of women reported using indoor insecticides during pregnancy,
   45\% in their bedroom and 47\% elsewhere in the house. Plug-in devices
   were the most frequent application methods used in the pregnant woman's
   bedroom and insecticide sprays elsewhere in the house. The maternal
   factors related to prenatal use of indoor insecticides were parity,
   country of birth, educational level, region of residence, having a
   garden or yard with plants, and living near an agricultural area. These
   products continued to be used postnatally, although 20\% of the women
   stopped using them. Foetuses and children are especially vulnerable to
   pesticide exposure; thus knowing how pesticides are used during
   pregnancy and infancy may be a starting point for the study of their
   potential effects on health as well as useful for designing preventive
   actions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In summer 2007: with the help of a written questionnaire, the attitudes
   of more than 400 visitors to the zoological garden of Zurich,
   Switzerland, toward the idea of feeding live insects to lizards, live
   fish to otters, and live rabbits to tigers were investigated. The
   majority of Swiss zoo visitors agreed with the idea of feeding live prey
   (invertebrates and vertebrates) to zoo animals, both off- and
   on-exhibit, except in the case of feeding live rabbits to tigers
   on-exhibit. Women and frequent visitors of the zoo disagreed more often
   with the on-exhibit feeding of live rabbits to tigers. Study
   participants with a higher level of education were more likely to agree
   with the idea of feeding live invertebrates and vertebrates to zoo
   animals off-exhibit. In comparison to an earlier study undertaken in
   Scotland, zoo visitors in Switzerland were more often in favor of the
   live feeding of vertebrates. Feeding live prey can counter the loss of
   hunting skills of carnivores and improve the animals' well-being.
   However, feeding enrichments have to strike a balance between optimal
   living conditions of animals and the quality of visitor experience. Our
   results show that such a balance can be found, especially when live
   feeding of mammals is carried out off-exhibit. A good interpretation of
   food enrichment might help zoos to win more support for the issue, and
   for re-introduction programs and conservation. Zoo Biol 29:344-350,

Abstract = {The Butia genus is widely distributed in the state of Rio Grande do Sul
   and it is established as an important part of this biodiversity. Due to
   its importance, a survey of traditional knowledge about this palm was
   conducted, focusing on uses of the plant and fruits. For this research,
   interviews were realized in rural communities of seven counties in the
   south of Rio Grande do Sul. Among the main uses of the butia palm
   related by the interviewers, the consumption of the fruit in natura, the
   juice production, liquors, jams, ice creams, cakes, candies and other
   desserts stand out. There are agro-industries producing natural butia
   palm juice as a new alternative to supplement the family income.
   Handicrafts are made with leaves and fruit pulp and sold in local fairs.
   This plant is also used as an ornamental in gardens and backyards. The
   interviewers recognize great variability among Butia fruits in terms of
   size, flavor, skin coloring, dehiscence and acidity. They report the
   intense interaction of birds and insects with the plant especially in
   the flowering and fruiting period. Along with the maintenance of the
   traditional uses of the plant by the population, innovative products
   from butia palm are being developed. There is a considerable potential
   to expand the uses of the Butia plant, mainly in cooking, sweet
   production, jam, juice and liquor. The visited communities showed a
   relationship of affection and respect for the Butia palms.},

   pesticide use and other risk factors were assessed by using an
   in-person, interviewer-administered questionnaire. Unconditional
   logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95\%
   confidence intervals. Breast cancer risk was associated with ever
   lifetime residential pesticide use (odds ratio = 1.39, 95\% confidence
   interval: 1.15, 1.68). However, there was no evidence of increasing risk
   with increasing lifetime applications. Lawn and garden pesticide use was
   associated with breast cancer risk, but there was no dose response.
   Little or no association was found for nuisance-pest pesticides, insect
   repellants, or products to control lice or fleas and ticks on pets. This
   study is the first known to suggest that self-reported use of
   residential pesticides may increase breast cancer risk. Further
   investigation in other populations is necessary to confirm these
   findings.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have linked non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with
   occupational exposure to insecticides, but residential use is largely
   unexplored. In this population-based case-control study, we examined NHL
   risk and use of insecticides in the home and garden. We identified NHL
   cases, uninfected with HIV, diagnosed between 1998 and 2000 among women
   and men ages 20 to 74 years in Iowa and the metropolitan areas of Los
   Angeles, Detroit, and Seattle. Controls were selected using random digit
   dialing or Medicare files. Computer-assisted personal interviews (1,321
   cases and 1,057 controls) elicited data on insecticide use at each home
   occupied since 1970. Insecticide levels were measured in dust taken from
   used vacuum cleaner bags (682 cases and 513 controls). We previously
   reported a positive association with dichtorodiphenyldichloroethylene
   levels in carpet dust residues. Here, we focus on insecticides
   Introduction that were commonly used after 1970, the time period covered
   by our questionnaire. People whose homes were treated for termites had
   elevated NHL risk (odds ratio, 1.3; 95\% confidence interval, 1.0-1.6).
   Risk was modestly, although not significantly, elevated in all but one
   study center and in all sexes and races. The elevation in risk was
   restricted to people whose homes were treated before the 1988 chlordane
   ban. There was a significant trend of increasing risk with increasing
   levels of alpha-chlordane residues in dust (P-trend = 0.04) and a
   marginally significant trend for gamma-chlordane (P-trend = 0.06). We
   found no evidence of associations for insects overall, for specific
   types of insects other than termites, or for elevated residues of other
   insecticides. We concluded that chlordane treatment of homes for
   termites may increase residents' NHL risk.},

Abstract = {Extracts from three species of the plant family Piperaceae, Piper
   nigruin {[}L.], Piper guineense {[}Schum \& Thonn], and Piper
   tuberculatum {[}Jacq.], were tested for efficacy against insects from
   five orders. All three species contain isobutyl amides, plant secondary
   compounds that act as neurotoxins in insects. These materials are
   considered safe to mammals because Piper spp. were used for centuries
   for spice and medicinal purposes. When 24-h P. nigruin LC(50) values
   were compared between common insect pests from eastern Canada and the
   northeastern United States, the most sensitive species in order of
   increasing lethal concentration were eastern tent caterpillar,
   Malacosoma antericanum (F.) < European pine sawfly larvae, Neodiprion
   sertifer (Geoffroy) < spindle ermine moth larvae, Yponomeuta cagnagella
   {[}Hubner] < viburnum leaf beetle larvae, Pyrrhalta viburni {[}Paykull]
   < stripped cucumber beetle adults, Acalymma vittatum (F.) < Colorado
   potato beetle adults, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) < Japanesebectle
   adults, Popillia japonica {[}Newman] < hairy chinch bug, Blissus
   leucopterus hirtis {[}Montandon]. The life stage tested was the point at
   which each species causes the greatest amount of damage to the host
   plant and the point at which most gardeners would likely choose to treat
   with a conventional synthetic insecticide. Greenhouse trials revealed
   that the pepper formulations also had a repellent activity, thus
   protecting plant leaves from 1) herbivory (lily leaf beetle, Lilioceris
   lilii {[}Scopoli], adults and larvae and stripped cucumber beetle
   adults) and 2) oviposition {[}European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis
   (Hubner) ]. Combinations with other botanical extracts were additive at
   best in toxicity and repellent trials. Nontarget toxicity to beneficial
   invertebrates is a possibility because the P. nigrum LC(50) for
   beneficial ladybird beetles was 0.2\%. P. nigrum extracts can provide a
   reasonable level of control against lepidopteran and European pine
   sawfly larvae and also will work as a short-term repellent and feeding
   deterrent. It is recommended that the use of Piper extracts be
   restricted to small-scale spot treatments in residential areas where
   insect pest outbreaks have occurred.},

Abstract = {Epidemiologic studies have used both questionnaires and carpet dust
   sampling to assess residential exposure to pesticides. The consistency
   of the information provided by these two approaches has not been
   explored. In a population-based case-control study of non-Hodgkin's
   lymphoma, carpet dust samples were collected from the homes of 513
   control subjects in Detroit, Iowa, Los Angeles, and Seattle. The samples
   were taken from used vacuum cleaner bags and analyzed for 30 pesticides.
   Interviewers queried subjects about the types of pests treated in their
   home using a detailed questionnaire accompanied by visual aids.
   Geographic variations in pesticide levels were generally consistent with
   geographic differences in pest treatment practices. Los Angeles
   residents reported the most treatment for crawling insects, fleas/ticks,
   and termites, and Los Angeles dust samples had the highest levels of
   propoxur, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, permethrin, and chlordane. Iowa had
   the most treatment for lawn/garden weeds, and also the highest levels of
   2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and dicamba. Although Seattle had the
   highest proportion of subjects treating for lawn/garden insects, the
   lawn/garden insecticides were higher in other sites. Multivariate linear
   regression revealed several significant associations between the type of
   pest treated and dust levels of specific pesticides. The strongest
   associations were between termite treatment and chlordane, and flea/tick
   treatment and permethrin. Most of the significant associations were
   consistent with known uses of the pesticides; few expected associations
   were absent. The consistency between the questionnaire data and
   pesticide residues measured in dust lends credibility to both methods
   for assessing residential exposure to pesticides. The combined
   techniques appear promising for epidemiologic studies. Interviewing is
   the only way to assess pesticide exposures before current carpets were
   in place. Dust sampling provides an objective measure of specific
   compounds to which a person may have been exposed through personal use
   of a pesticide or by drift-in or track-in from outside, and avoids
   recall bias.},

Pages = {225-248},
Abstract = {In the Botanical Garden of Orotava various ornithophilous plants, which
   were introduced there, were visited by indigenous birds for nectar and
   in 1 case (Orthostemon) for food tissue. Of the 3 bird species involved,
   an endemic race of chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita) and resident
   blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) exploit and pollinate flowers
   legitimately, while the wild canary (Serinus canaria) is predominantly a
   destructive nectar robber. The insular chiffchaff ia a regular
   pollinator in the wild, at least of Canarina canariensis and Isoplexis
   canariensis, 2 ornithophilous paleoendemics. Ornithophily is naturally
   practiced on the island, though by birds basically insectivorous. A list
   of Macaronesian plants with ornithophilous characters is presented,
   including the newly recognized Teucrium heterophyllum and Scrophularia
   calliantha. The modern visitors of canarian bird flowers are secondary
   rather than the original partners of the continental Tertiary flora in
   which these plants originated. Palearctic immigrants, when becoming
   resident on the islands during and since the Pleistocene, adopted
   facultative nectar feeding, entering an ``orphaned{''} food niche.
   Casual flower visits in Europe suggest a certain predisposition of the
   chiffchaff and the blackcap for the exploitation of flowers. The ability
   of unspecialized birds to acquire nectar drinking spontaneously and to
   pass this habit on to their offspring, is demonstrated by a population
   of tree sparrows (Passer montanus) which have visited ornithophilous
   Kniphofia (Liliaceae) in Berlin for several years.},

   hummingbird diversity in Mexico City},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN ECOLOGY},

Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {In recent times urbanization has significantly expanded, and along with
   factors such as agriculture, deforestation, climate change, and the
   introduction of exotic species, has severely impacted biodiversity.
   However, biodiversity is essential for maintaining ecosystem stability
   and providing crucial ecosystem services, including water purification,
   climate regulation, air filtration, pollination, and recreational and
   cultural benefits. Urban gardens have emerged as effective
   rehabilitation proposals for urban green spaces. These urban green
   spaces provide habitat for various species, contribute to climate
   regulation, and offer recreational spaces for residents. Monitoring the
   impact of these urban green spaces rehabilitation efforts is essential,
   with several species serving as bioindicators of environmental quality.
   This study focuses on the pollinator garden established by the Mexico
   City government called Parque Lineal Canal Nacional (PCN), which uses
   native plants to attract animal visitors. Data from eBird (2015-2024)
   showed a significant increase in hummingbird diversity (taxonomic,
   functional and phylogenetic) following the garden's establishment, from
   three species before intervention to 13 species after. This increase
   highlights the effectiveness of urban gardens in supporting urban
   biodiversity. Pollinator gardens, specifically, have proven
   effectiveness in enhancing biodiversity by providing nectar and pollen,
   which attract higher populations of pollinators. Hummingbirds, as
   nectarivorous birds, are particularly responsive to the presence of
   flowering plants in these gardens, leading to increased diversity and
   abundance. Future studies are necessary and collaboration between urban
   planners, ecologists and local communities is vital to create
   sustainable and biodiverse spaces.},

Title = {Honey bees and native flower visitors in a Boston suburb: Assessing
   coexistence and conservation strategies},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {299},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Concern that non-native honey bees ( Apis mellifera) may disrupt and
   outcompete native pollinators is leading governments to consider
   restricting honey bee hives. However, local-scale information on the
   specific flower visitation patterns of honey bees and native insects is
   often absent from the decision-making process. To address this concern,
   we observed insect visitation to 391 native and non-native plant species
   in Newton, Massachusetts (USA), a Boston suburb with extensive
   conservation areas and public and private gardens. We found that honey
   bees and native bees, including bumblebees and solitary bees, visited a
   wide variety of cultivated, native, adventive, and pollinator garden
   plants. Cultivated plants received more overall visits than wild plant
   species, but the most visited plants were often wild plant species with
   mixed visitation by honey bees and native pollinators. For many plant
   species, particularly cultivated plants, we did not observe any flower
   visitation. These findings suggest that at this suburban location,
   floral resources seem sufficient to allow coexistence between honey
   bees, bumblebees and other native bees. We suggest that residents and
   government officials consider doing simple surveys like this one prior
   to altering regulations of honey bees. In situations like Newton, in
   addition to evaluating regulations on honey bee hives, we suggest
   officials consider ways to reduce other threats to native
   flower-visiting insects, such as herbicide and pesticide use and habitat
   loss, while also planting pollinator gardens and wildflower meadows to
   increase available resources.},

Abstract = {Municipal authorities around the world have come to recognize the
   importance of making conservation and restoration a priority. Multiple
   urban restoration programs now foster insects and other pollinators
   through planting and sowing flowering plants, many of them within
   residential areas. But residents are not only walking next to
   pollinators visiting flowering sidewalk grass verges, they are also
   walking on top of them, nesting in the cracks and interstices of urban
   pavements.Combining morphological and molecular monitoring schemes, we
   conducted a survey of urban pavements at twelve locations across Berlin
   and found that pavements can foster a surprising number and quantity of
   soil dwelling insects-in particular wild bees and wasps. Pavements
   located within 200 m to an insect-friendly flower garden were covered
   with significantly more nests of wild bees and solitary wasps, and
   showed higher species richness of these groups, while the degree of
   sealed surfaces in the surrounding had no effect per se. This underlines
   the positive impact that insect-friendly gardens can have for
   pollinators and other insects, even in highly sealed areas. Also, it
   shows the potential of cobbled pavements as valuable nesting sites in
   highly sealed urban areas. We provide a list of 55 species of
   ground-nesting Hymenoptera found in Berlin pavements, including 28
   species of wild bees and 22 apoid wasps. In our study, the molecular
   approach only detected three Hymenoptera species and did not yield
   comparable results to classical monitoring. Nonetheless, using eDNA
   methods might be a promising tool for further studying soil nesting
   insects in the future, and to gain insights into the web of life in

Title = {Characteristics of urban milkweed gardens that influence monarch
   butterfly egg abundance},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {The eastern population of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) has
   dramatically declined in the last few decades, which is largely
   attributed to a loss of milkweed habitat in agricultural areas.
   Residential land in metropolitan areas has the potential to provide a
   significant source of the milkweed needed to support the monarch
   population. To examine if and how urban milkweed patches can support
   monarch butterflies, we worked with community scientists in the Chicago
   metropolitan area to monitor monarch eggs and caterpillars in yards and
   community gardens. We hypothesized that the largest numbers of eggs
   (i.e. gardens that were most attractive to monarchs) would be observed
   in patches that were older, had a high abundance of milkweed, contained
   more than one species of milkweed including Asclepias syriaca (common
   milkweed) and/or A. incarnata (swamp milkweed), and had a large
   diversity of nectar plants. All patches were assessed at their peak egg
   count each year, which ranged from zero to 170 eggs in a given
   observation. To determine which characteristics were most influential to
   egg presence, we examined patches where eggs were present or absent
   during this peak observation. For abundance, we divided these peak
   observations into whether or not the egg counts were in the top 20\% in
   a given year, excluding patches where eggs were absent, and assessed
   their patch characteristics. Our results show that patch age and
   presence of A. syriaca affected whether patches contained eggs or not.
   We also found that patches with the largest number of eggs observed
   tended to have A. syriaca, more milkweed plants, and a higher diversity
   of blooming plant species. The data we collected from community
   scientists in the Chicago area has enhanced our understanding of how
   urban gardeners can create effective breeding habitats for monarch
   butterflies. By planting Asclepias syriaca within its natural range,
   along with other native milkweed species and a diverse selection of
   flowering plants, individuals can create gardens that serve as excellent
   habitats for monarchs and other pollinators.},

Title = {The public-private divide and seasonal variation shape bird diversity in
   greenspaces of two neighboring midwestern USA cities},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {247},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Greenspaces are increasingly valued for supporting biodiversity in
   urbanized landscapes. Previous research efforts have emphasized the
   importance of public land such as parks and nature preserves for
   biodiversity, yet private yards in residential neighborhoods also have
   great potential for species conservation. Our study considered the
   importance of adjacent public and private greenspaces for urban bird
   diversity. We surveyed birds in public parks (n = 39) and private yards
   (n = 41) distributed across neighboring twin cities (Champaign and
   Urbana) in Illinois, USA, to assess potential differences in bird
   diversity across: (1) the public-private divide; (2) seasons (winter vs.
   summer); and (3) the two cities. We found a seasonal interaction across
   the public-private divide. In summer, communities in private yards were
   a subset of those found in public parks, whereas in winter, both private
   yards and public parks hosted equally diverse yet distinct species
   assemblages. Between the two cities, Urbana supported greater bird
   diversity and a distinct species assemblage compared to the warmer, more
   urbanized city of Champaign. Our results demonstrate that both public
   parks and private yards play key roles in supporting native bird
   diversity, but also highlight that these roles can shift across seasons.
   Furthermore, we show that neighboring cities within the same conurbation
   can differ substantially in bird community structure and diversity. Our
   findings reinforce the importance of maintaining heterogeneous landscape
   mosaics and combining land sparing and land sharing approaches to
   maximize bird diversity in urban areas.},

Title = {Predator-Proofing Avian Nestboxes: A Review of Interventions,
   Opportunities, and Challenges},
Journal = {BIRDS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-23},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Simple Summary On a global scale, about 20\% of bird species nest in
   tree cavities, and many of these species will utilise artificial
   nestboxes. Homeowners often add nestboxes to gardens to provide new
   opportunities for enjoyment and engagement with nature. Nestbox schemes
   can also be used for conservation, especially in environments that have
   few natural cavities, such as open landscapes and woodlands with
   relatively young and even-aged trees, including plantations. However,
   tree-nesting birds using simple wooden nestboxes can be at risk from
   predators. A range of different strategies to reduce predation risk has
   been developed. These typically involve: (1) modifying the nestbox
   itself by, for example, adding a metal plate around the entrance hole to
   stop predators enlarging the hole or changing construction materials;
   (2) modifying the immediate surroundings of the nestbox, for example, by
   using barriers to prevent predator access; or (3) modifying nestbox
   placement. A common assumption is that such interventions provide a net
   benefit. However, this is not necessarily true as predator-proofing
   avian nestboxes often has hidden costs, such as changing nest
   temperature or humidity or making it harder for adult birds to feed
   their chicks. This review considers intervention effectiveness and the
   potential for hidden costs to make recommendations for practice.Abstract
   Nestboxes are commonly used to increase the number and quality of nest
   sites available to birds that usually use tree cavities and are
   considered an important conservation intervention. Although usually
   safer than natural cavities, birds nesting in simple, unmodified wooden
   nestboxes remain at risk of depredation. Accordingly, numerous design
   and placement modifications have been developed to `predator-proof'
   nestboxes. These include: (1) adding metal plates around entrance holes
   to prevent enlargement; (2) affixing wire mesh to side panels; (3)
   deepening boxes to increase distance to nest cup; (4) creating external
   entrance `tunnels' or internal wooden ledges; (5) using more robust
   construction materials; (6) developing photosensitive shutters to
   exclude nocturnal predators; (7) using baffles to block climbing
   mammals; and (8) regular replacement and relocation. However, the
   benefits and costs of these modifications are not always well
   understood. In this global review, we collate information on
   predator-proofing avian nestboxes designed for tree cavity-nesting birds
   to assess the efficacy of techniques for different predators (mammalian,
   avian, and reptilian) in different contexts. We critique the potential
   for modifications to have unintended consequences-including increasing
   nest building effort, altering microclimate, reducing provisioning rate,
   and elevating ectoparasite and microbial loads-to identify hidden costs.
   We conclude by highlighting remaining gaps in knowledge and providing
   guidance on optimal modifications in different contexts.},

Title = {Challenges of proper disposal of old long-lasting insecticidal nets and

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Volume = {19},

Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Introduction Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), specifically long-lasting
   insecticidal nets (LLINs), are the most commonly used, scalable, and
   cost-effective tools for controlling malaria transmission in sub-Saharan
   Africa. However, the multiple alternative uses of retired LLINs have
   been associated with poor disposal practices. The World Health
   Organization (WHO) has provided guidelines and recommendations for the
   proper management of worn-out LLINs. This study assessed the existing
   alternative uses and disposal practices of old LLINs.Methods An
   explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach was used to assess LLINs
   existing alternative uses, disposal practices, knowledge, and
   perceptions regarding WHO recommendations on proper disposal of old
   LLINs among stakeholders in Kilombero and Ulanga districts,
   south-eastern Tanzania. A survey questionnaire was administered to 384
   participants. Furthermore, the study employed focus group discussions
   (FGD) and key informant interviews (KII) to elucidate responses
   regarding existing disposal practices, associated challenges, and
   alternative uses of LLINs. The insights derived from both study
   components were subsequently used for inferential analysis.Results The
   major challenge influencing the proper disposal of LLINs was limited
   awareness of how to properly dispose of them. Of the 384 people
   surveyed, 97.0\% were not aware of the WHO recommendations for the
   proper disposal of old LLINs. All key informants were unaware of the WHO
   guidelines for proper disposal of old LLINs. The common methods used to
   dispose of LLINs were burning (30.7\%), disposing them into garbage pits
   (14.8\%), and alternative uses (12.2\%). Of the 239 respondents with
   LLINs, 41.0\% had alternative use, while 59.0\% had no alternative use.
   The common alternative uses were ropes for tying or covering items
   (20.9\%), garden fencing (7.5\%), chicken coops (5.0\%), and 7.5\% for
   other minor alternative uses.Conclusion Strengthening awareness and
   education on proper LLIN disposal practices among community members and
   key stakeholders is essential for enhancing malaria control efforts and
   preventing environmental pollution.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study was to investigate Combination level
   and Role of Indigenous and Modern Soil Conservation Practices in the
   case of Yayo District, Ilubabor zone, southwest Ethiopia.
   Cross-sectional research designs with both qualitative and quantitative
   research approaches were employed. Two stage sampling procedures with
   combination of purposive and simple random sampling procedures were used
   to select 210 sample household heads for the study. Household survey
   questionnaires, key informant interview, focus group discussion and
   field observation were used to collect the data. Binary logistic model
   was used to identify determinant factors of farmers' decision to adopt
   soil conservation practices. The finding of the study showed that
   contour plowing, farmyard manure and traditional cut-off drain were the
   most practiced indigenous soil conservation practices. Improved crop
   seed, use of chemical fertilizer and insecticide and pesticide were the
   major improved/modern/ soil conservation practiced performed by
   household of the study areas. Insubstantial level of integration between
   indigenous and modern soil conservation practices were another finding
   of the study. The result also indicated as decrease soil erosion,
   improve income, improve water availability, and increase crop \&
   livestock productivity were to the major contributions of integrating
   indigenous and modern soil conservation practiced in the study area..
   The result of binary logistic regression analysis showed as livestock
   ownership, distances to farm plot, access to credit services and
   extension services were significantly (p<0.05) affect household
   decisions to adopt soil conservation practices. Therefore, farmers
   should be adopting profitable and sustainable soil management practice
   and integrate indigenous with modern soil management practices.},

Title = {Gardening work in an urban environment and the notion of territory},

Volume = {77},
Number = {1},
Pages = {321-330},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are several characteristics of working in an urban
   environment that challenge the usual forms of work prescription.
   OBJECTIVE: This is a case study on the work of gardeners in an urban
   setting in the north of Paris. This paper develops the notion of
   territory, which we define as a system that is locally rooted in an open
   environment through the situated actions of gardeners' work. As the
   employees do their work in an outside environment, interactions in
   real-life situations are beyond the control of work organization. City
   gardeners' work is carried out in a green, living and human environment.
   METHODS: We conducted detailed open observations in a town's green
   zones. These were complemented by individual interviews in work
   situations and by collective interviews within the boundaries of the
   municipality.
   RESULTS: We use the notion of territory to highlight the particularity
   of work within organizations where the work environment cannot be
   limited to the space inside their walls. The gardeners' work makes it
   possible to link residents and passers-by (on foot or in vehicles) with
   the town's green spaces (micro-ecosystems). Their work consists in
   connecting the different expectations and needs of the various life
   forms: the human beings (with a variety of lifestyles), as well as the
   plants, insects and animals.
   CONCLUSION: The particularities of working in an open environment create
   complex forms of prescription. The notion of territory, rarely used in
   ergonomics, proves to be fruitful for considering work in these
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Sustaining a broad diversity of plants is key for a sustainable future.
   For instance, providing a variety of flowering plants in urban and
   agricultural landscapes mitigates the current decline of pollinators and
   biodiversity in general. Therefore, educating about the diversity of
   flowering plants has high current relevance for biology and
   environmental education. Unfortunately, students have little knowledge
   about plant diversity and find botanical topics often uninteresting.
   Therefore, this paper presents and discusses an engaging teaching
   approach, where students engage in a role-play with 3D-printed flower
   models to learn how the morphology of plants affects different insect
   pollinator groups. To gain insights into students' experiences with the
   flower models, guided interviews were conducted one week after this
   role-play. The interview results show that the students were not only
   motivated to engage in the role-play, but also gained content knowledge
   on how the diversity of flowers affects insect pollinators. Hence, the
   approach highlights how 3D printing can contribute to design teaching
   approaches that engage students in hands-on activities in order to
   foster their understanding of flower diversity.},

Abstract = {Birds are a prominent component of urban biodiversity yet many species,
   particularly forest-dependent birds, are vulnerable to landscape
   transformation. We examined the relative influence of three factors that
   potentially influence forest bird communities in residential areas of
   Melbourne, Australia: (i) local habitat attributes; (ii) types of land
   use; and (iii) biotic interactions with an aggressive native species,
   the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). We also investigated
   characteristics of urban sites that contribute most to landscape-level
   diversity of forest species. We systematically surveyed forest birds at
   300 sites in a range of urban land-uses; with sites clustered in 30
   landscapes representing gradients in housing cover and tree cover.
   Composition and richness of forest bird communities differed among
   land-use types: sites with greater cover of native canopy trees had a
   distinct and richer avifauna. However, a pervasive influence on
   communities was the relative abundance of the noisy miner, a native
   species that aggressively excludes small insectivores. Sites in native
   vegetation made the greatest contribution to landscape-level richness of
   forest birds, but also were negatively influenced by noisy miner
   occurrence. The dominance of the noisy miner poses a challenge for
   conservation because actions to improve urban habitat for forest species
   may also benefit this aggressive species. Conservation of forest birds
   will depend on larger forest tracts, fringing residential areas, which
   are less suitable for the noisy miner and serve as potential source
   populations for forest species. Within residential areas, enhancing
   understorey complexity with native shrubs and mid-storey will help
   improve urban habitats for forest birds.},

Abstract = {Horizontal green areas are becoming valuable, yet extruded spots, and

   developments is disrupting green infrastructure. Interlocked existing
   urban structures seldom allow for the creation of parks and larger green
   open spaces, which could provide a habitat for a wide range of insects,
   birds, and other small animals. The lack of green spaces causes urban
   heat islands (UHI) over the cities. Vertical gardens are alternative
   solutions for urban areas, where it is not possible to increase
   biodiversity by creating new horizontal green areas. They effectively
   utilise surfaces that would otherwise be unused and transform them into
   effective green infrastructure elements.Using the example of the
   historical city district of Bratislava, i.e., Old Town (Stare Mesto) in
   Slovakia, we present an alternative approach for resolving the lack of
   green areas. A case study was conducted to create a map of all the
   potentially suitable areas for the construction of vertical gardens. We
   divided these spots into three groups, i.e., walls, columns, and
   free-standing structures and proposed construction methods for each

Abstract = {This paper explores the more-than-human politics of a community garden
   in Rotterdam, as an expression of sustainable and resilient city making.
   Challenging the anthropocentrism underlying most research on the
   politics of urban sustainability/resilient and urban gardening, the
   paper pro-poses a more-than-human assemblage approach to urban gardening
   politics. I argue that urban gardens can be understood as
   more-than-human configurations and conceptualised as urban gar- den
   assemblages . Such assemblages are processes with different
   temporalities and types of agencies (insects, plants, soil and fences)
   and can be analytically understood as more-than-human: (1) relations and
   performances; (2) power hierarchies/resistances; and (3) ethical
   co-becomings. Building on participatory ethnography, interviews and
   (online) documents, the paper then presents an empirical account of the
   Gandhi-garden, a community garden in Rotterdam, embedded in the global
   Transition T owns movement. The empirical case shows how mundane acts of
   pulling weeds and using permacultural planting methods are
   more-than-human place-making practices. It also highlights how, for
   example, human-soil, human-seed and human-bee entanglements challenge
   urban neoliberalism while gardeners experiment with sustainable food and
   a non-violent economy. The paper illustrates the ethico-political
   expressions of more-than-human communitygardening through solidarity
   bonds with Palestine via olive trees and non-violence thinking, as well
   as some human/non-human ambivalences when dealing with dog waste and
   potentially harvest- stealing birds. Finally, the paper presents some
   reflections and contributions regarding scholarship in the fields of
   urban gardening, and sustainable/resilient city making.},

Title = {How can residents protect and promote pollinators? The diffusion of
   residential pollinator-friendly gardening},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {345},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Urbanization and land use change are leading causes of declines in
   pollinator abundance and diversity. However, researchers in different
   regions of the world have found that some pollinators can thrive in
   urban landscapes, depending on land use practices, environmental
   conditions, and species traits. Residential landscapes constitute a
   significant portion of urban green space and thus, residents' adoption
   of landscape practices to promote pollinators can play a central role in
   addressing the global pollinator challenge. Yet, although residents'
   willingness and intention appear strong, adoption of pollinator-friendly
   gardening remains low. The present study - guided by the Diffusion of
   Innovations theory - aimed to build empirical understanding by surveying
   1598 Florida residents on their experiences and perceptions related to
   pollinator-friendly gardening to determine the most salient barriers and
   opportunities to engagement. Key findings suggest making the practice
   more widely observable and reducing perceived complexity in learning to
   do the practice are critical to promoting adoption. This demonstrates,
   in practical terms, that: (1) targeted efforts to build residents'
   actionable knowledge about pollinator-friendly gardening may
   significantly reduce uncertainty and boost the likelihood of adoption;
   and (2) examples of active pollinator gardens need to be more widely
   showcased and popularized (e.g., through experiential or virtual
   demonstrations). We also found most residents living in homeowner
   associations (HOAs) believed HOA policies on pollinator-friendly
   gardening were restrictive or the residents were unsure whether they are
   allowed to practice pollinator-friendly gardening. Given these
   perceptions strongly associated with residents' low intent to engage in
   pollinator-friendly gardening, a major opportunity exists to diffuse the
   practice and increase adoption by working with HOAs and community
   leaders to become promoters of - rather than barriers to -
   pollinator-friendly gardening.},

Abstract = {Nectar and pollen are floral resources that provide food for insect
   pollinators, so quantifying their supplies can help us to understand and
   mitigate pollinator declines. However, most existing datasets of floral
   resource measurements focus on native plants found in rural landscapes,
   so cannot be used effectively for estimating supplies in urban green
   spaces, where non-native ornamental plants often predominate.We sampled
   floral nectar sugar in 225 plant taxa found in UK residential gardens
   and other urban green spaces, focussing on the most common species. The
   vast majority (94\%) of our sampled taxa are non-native, filling an
   important research gap and ensuring these data are also relevant outside
   of the United Kingdom.Our dataset includes values of daily nectar sugar
   production for all 225 taxa and nectar sugar concentration for around
   half (102) of those sampled. Nectar extraction was conducted according
   to published methods, ensuring our values can be combined with other
   datasets.We anticipate that the two main uses of these data are (1) to
   estimate the nectar production of habitats and landscapes and (2) to
   identify high-nectar plants of conservation importance. To increase the
   utility of our data, we provide guidance for scaling nectar values up

   droppings, cattle and buffalo meat, sewage water, poultry flies, chicken
   meat, and canal water from 131 sites across Faisalabad, Pakistan, to be
   tested for mcr-1-positive and mcr-3-positive Escherichia coli. We
   recruited new patients admitted to Allied Hospital, Faisalabad,
   Pakistan, with abdominal pain and diarrhoea for rectal swabs. Patients
   with dysentery and those who were already on antibiotic treatment were
   excluded. Data for colistin trade between 2017 and 2020, including
   importation, manufacturing, and usage, were accessed from online
   databases and government sources in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nigeria.
   We recruited participants from poultry farms and veterinary drug stores
   in Pakistan and Nigeria to be interviewed using a structured
   questionnaire. International manufacturing, import, and export data;
   value analysis; and trade routes of colistin pharmaceutical raw material
   (PRM), feed additive, and finished pharmaceutical products (FPPs) were
   accessed from 2017-21 export data sets.Findings We collected 1131
   samples between May 12, 2018, and July 1, 2019: backyard poultry cloacal
   swabs (n=100), commercial broiler cloacal swabs (n=102), cattle and
   buffalo rectal swabs (n=188), human rectal swabs (n=200), wild bird
   droppings (n=100), cattle and buffalo meat (n=100), sewage water (n=90),
   poultry flies (n=100), chicken meat (n=100), and canal water (n=51). We
   recruited 200 inpatients at Allied Hospital, Faisalabad, Pakistan,
   between Nov 15, 2018, and Dec 14, 2018, for rectal swabs. We recruited
   21 participants between Jan 1, 2020, and Dec 31, 2020, from poultry
   farms and drug stores in Pakistan and Nigeria to be interviewed. 75
   (7\%) of 1131 samples contained mcr-1-positive E coli, including wild
   bird droppings (25 {[}25\%] of 100), commercial broiler cloacal swabs
   (17 {[}17\%] of 100), backyard poultry cloacal swabs (one {[}1\%] of
   100), chicken meat (13 {[}13\%] of 100), cattle and buffalo meat (two
   {[}2\%] of 100), poultry flies (eight {[}8\%] of 100), sewage water (six
   {[}7\%] of 90), and human rectal swabs (three {[}2\%] of 200). During
   2017-20, Pakistan imported 275 center dot 5 tonnes (68 center dot 9
   tonnes per year, 95\% CI 41 center dot 2-96 center dot 6) of colistin as
   PRM, all sourced from China, 701 center dot 9 tonnes (175 center dot 5
   tonnes per year, 140 center dot 9-210 center dot 1) of colistin as feed
   additives from China and Viet Nam, and 63 center dot 0 tonnes (15 center
   dot 8 tonnes per year, 10 center dot 4-21 center dot 1) of colistin as
   FPPs from various countries in Asia and Europe. For Bangladesh and
   Nigeria, colistin PRM and FPPs were imported from China and Europe.
   Colistin knowledge and usage practices in Pakistan and Nigeria were
   unsatisfactory in terms of understanding of the effects on human
   medicine and usage other than for treatment purposes.
   China is the major manufacturer of PRM and feed additive colistin and
   exported a total of 2664 center dot 8 tonnes (666 center dot 2 tonnes
   per year, 95\% CI 262 center dot 1 to 1070 center dot 2) of PRM and 2570
   center dot 2 tonnes (642 center dot 6 tonnes per year, -89 center dot 4
   to 1374 center dot 5) of feed additive in 1330 shipments during 2018-21
   to 21 countries.Interpretation Regardless of 193 countries signing the
   UN agreement to tackle antimicrobial resistance, trading of colistin as
   PRM, FPPs, and feed additive or growth promoter in low-income and
   middle-income countries continues unabated. Robust national and
   international laws are urgently required to mitigate the international
   trade of this antimicrobial listed on WHO Antimicrobials for Human
   Medicine. Copyright (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   the last decade in Mexico City},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Hummingbirds are nectarivorous birds with a very fast metabolism, which
   requires constant access to resources. In cities, resources have
   distinct abundances and availability from natural environments, which
   leads to the exclusion of some species. However, other species may
   increase in abundance within cities, causing a process of biotic
   homogenization. In this work we evaluated whether the abundance of five
   resident hummingbird species has increased in Mexico City over the last
   decade. Additionally, we evaluated whether these hummingbirds used
   feeders throughout the year. Finally, we determined the reproductive
   season of hummingbirds and evaluated whether it is longer in Mexico City
   than in non-urban locations. Our results indicate that during the last
   decade, the abundance of Berylline Hummingbird and Broad-billed
   Hummingbird has increased in Mexico City. Both species take advantage of
   the feeders throughout the year. This constant availability of resources
   has allowed both species to extend their breeding season, leading to
   constantly increasing abundance. One way to avoid biotic homogenization
   in cities is to implement conservation strategies that include
   variations in the availability and abundance of native floral resources
   such as pollinator gardens, rather than constantly available artificial
   resources like feeders.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JAN 11},
Abstract = {Wild insect pollinators are essential to cultivated and natural
   ecosystems globally. Today, many pollinator species are declining. One
   reason is a general lack of flowering habitats at landscape scales.
   However, urban areas, including private gardens, may provide flowers,
   and constitute beneficial habitats for pollinators. Here, we evaluate
   the ecological outcomes of a citizen science campaign run by the Swedish
   Society for Nature Conservation (SSNC) (called ``Operation: Save the
   bees{''}), encouraging citizens to incorporate interventions beneficial
   to wild pollinators (garden meadows, flower plantings, and bee hotels)
   in their gardens. Data on insect observations and flowering plants were
   collected through online questionnaires at the end of the growing
   season. In total, we received 3,758 responses for the three
   interventions. We found that participants were more likely to observe
   many pollinators (as opposed to few or none) in more species rich garden
   meadows, and in larger and older plantings. The surrounding environment
   also affected pollinator abundance: fewer pollinators were observed in
   plantings in dense urban areas. Direct counts of pollinators during
   10-min surveys correlated strongly to the simplistic abundance
   assessment (none, few, or many insects seen over the summer season). Bee
   hotel occupancy was positively related to local flower availability and
   bee hotel age. Smaller nest holes (<10 mm) were more occupied than
   larger holes (11-15 mm) and hotels in rural gardens and
   natural/semi-natural sites were more occupied than those in urban
   gardens. This study demonstrates that flower-rich private gardens
   provide integral habitat for wild pollinators and that citizen science
   programs can provide a tool for implementing and evaluating conservation
   practices. However, longer lasting commitment resulting in older
   interventions are preferable and should be encouraged in future
   campaigns.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDPesticides are one of the most important anthropogenic-related
   stressors. In times of global pollinator decline, the role of integrated
   farming and urban gardens in supporting wild pollinators is becoming
   increasingly important. We circulated an online questionnaire to survey
   plant protection practices among Hungarian farmers and garden owners
   with a particular emphasis on pollinator protection. RESULTSWe found
   that plant growers rely heavily on pesticide use, and pesticides are
   used widely in otherwise pollinator-friendly gardens. Whether pesticide
   use practices were driven by expert opinion and respondent gender were
   the best predictors of pesticide use. Although most respondents
   supported pollinators, pesticides are also used widely among home garden
   owners, which can pose a non-evident ecological trap for pollinator
   populations in the gardens. CONCLUSIONSpecial attention should be paid
   to implementing measures to reduce pesticide use not only in farmland,
   but also in home gardens. Environmental education and financial support
   through agroecological schemes could efficiently promote the transition
   away from pesticide use. However, whereas farmers can be encouraged to
   reduce pesticide use mostly by expert advice, garden owners are likely
   to rely on more conventional information channels. The attitudes of
   Hungarian plant growers can provide an insight into pesticide use
   practices of Central and Eastern European countries, but similar surveys
   are needed across Europe for a complete understanding of broad-scale
   processes. This work lays the foundations for similar studies that can
   inform and facilitate the transformation to pesticide-free farming and
   gardening. (c) 2022 The Authors. Pest Management Science published by

Abstract = {Growing public awareness of pollinator declines has led to an increase
   in gardening for pollinators, particularly bees. In most regions of the
   United States a better understanding of the plants that support abundant

   programs. To address this, we compared the relative attractiveness of 23
   native Pacific Northwest plant species to bees. We performed timed bee
   counts and vacuum-sampled bee communities, weekly, when plots were in
   peak bloom. Across three field seasons, we found that Douglas' aster

   goldenrod (Solidago canadensis), farewell-to-spring (Clarkia amoena),
   globe gilia (Gilia capitata), and Oregon sunshine (Eriophyllum lanatum)
   consistently harbored high bee abundance and species richness, and show
   great potential for garden pollinator plantings. These findings can be
   applied to residential and community gardens, municipal parks and other
   plantings, as well as by restoration professionals and policy makers

Abstract = {A Teaching-Learning Sequence (TLS) for pre-service teachers is
   introduced, together with the results obtained after two consecutive
   implementations at two different universities, with a redesign phase
   between them. Its objective is promoting knowledge about plant
   reproduction, the importance of entomophile pollination, and the
   taxonomic groups of pollinators in the Iberian Peninsula. Its design was
   approached from a strategy of science education in context, by using
   learning gardens as real contexts, and including among its activities
   the use of scientific drawing for teaching-learning on anatomy (flowers
   and pollinators), and the realization of practical experiences,
   including a sampling of garden's pollinators, that was conducted by
   following a British citizen science program, translated and adapted. Its
   pilot implementation (n=21, Universitat Jaume I) and the implementation
   of the improved sequence (n=41, Universidad de Valladolid) are assessed
   based on the analysis of the responses given by students to a
   questionnaire that was conducted both initially and finally, including
   open and closed questions, and also graphic representations. Regarding
   plants, initial erroneous ideas on sexual reproduction were observed,
   such as obviating hermaphroditic flowers, or monoecious plants; the
   belief that there are angiosperms without flowers; associating flowers
   with pollen, but not with ovules; or a concept of pollen based on its
   external appearance instead of its function. All such ideas improved
   after instruction, particularly at Universidad de Valladolid. Regarding
   pollinators, the second implementation led to notable improvements in
   learning about their anatomy, diversity, and taxonomic classification.
   Potential improvements for the TLS are discussed, thus connecting its
   design with educational research.},

Title = {An Ecosystem Service Approach to Assessing Agro-Ecosystems in Urban
   Landscapes},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Creating sustainable urban landscapes in light of growing population
   pressures requires interdisciplinary multi-functional solutions.
   Alternative agro-ecosystems described as food forests, permaculture
   gardens, and/or edible landscapes among others could offer potential
   ways to address the social, economic, and ecological goals of various
   stakeholders simultaneously. Current research is lacking a comprehensive
   tool that can assess the performance of alternative agro-ecosystems that
   have both functional and aesthetic values. The present research uses a
   novel rubric, the Permaculture and Agro-ecosystems Sustainability
   Scorecard (PASS) that combines agricultural sustainability and ecosystem
   services (ES) indicators in order to assess alternative agro-ecosystems.
   The rubric evaluates provisioning, regulating, supporting, economic and
   cultural ES and includes benefits such as pollinator presence, increased
   biodiversity, alternative pesticides and fertilizer use, carbon
   sequestration, food security, and human interactions. Based on the
   concepts and principles drawn from four popular frameworks and
   sub-disciplines, namely, SAFE, SITES, permaculture, and agroecology, we
   identify sixteen broad ES indicators and 59 sub-indices and measure them
   using data collected through site observation, survey, interviews, and
   documentary research. For easy comparison across different urban
   agriculture sites, the above sub-indices are further aggregated into
   five ES criteria using stakeholder-informed weights. The weights are
   developed through pair-wise comparison of criteria by sample survey
   respondents. The PASS framework is used to score twelve sites in South
   Florida that meet specific criteria in the small farm, residential, and
   public space categories. Sample respondents place the highest weight on
   cultural services. Contrary to the popular notion of promoting urban
   agriculture for food security, the results show that the majority of the
   sites score highest in the supporting services provided, followed by
   regulating and cultural services, and lowest in the economic services
   category. The supporting service for most of the sample sites score
   consistently very high, close to the highest possible level of 5.0.
   There is a wide variation in provisioning and economic values across the
   study sites. The paper offers several ideas for mainstreaming the ES
   indicators into urban planning and decision-making and some of the
   practical difficulties one might face along the way. We conclude that in
   order to realize the broader ES benefits of urban agriculture in
   particular and agro-ecosystems in general, a multi-pronged policy and
   planning approach is necessary.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {212},
Number = {A},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Most of the global population are urban, with inhabitants exposed to
   raised levels of pollution. Pollutants negatively impact human
   wellbeing, and can alter the structure and diversity of ecosystems.
   Contrastingly, urban biodiversity can positively contribute to human
   wellbeing. We know little, however, about whether the negative impacts
   of pollution on wellbeing could be lessened for householders living on
   more biodiverse streets, as the complex interlinkages between pollution,
   biodiversity and wellbeing have rarely been examined. Here, we used
   structural equation modelling to simultaneously test whether
   biodiversity (actual and perceived) mediates the relationship between
   traffic-related pollution (noise, dB; nitrogen dioxide, NO2) or air
   pollution (PM2.5) and wellbeing (mental wellbeing, happiness). In summer
   2019, we conducted questionnaires and biodiversity surveys, and
   collected noise and air pollution data, from households (n = 282) across
   the streetscapes of Leeds, UK. Biodiversity (actual or perceived) showed
   no mediating effects. However, increased flowering plant richness was
   positively associated with mental wellbeing. Traffic-related pollution
   negatively affected pollinator and flowering plant richness, but not
   wellbeing. This could be because householders are not exposed to high
   levels of noise or NO2 because they do not maintain front gardens on
   noisier streets. There was no measurable effect of air pollution on
   biodiversity or wellbeing. These findings shed light on the complex
   mechanisms through which biodiversity could improve human wellbeing.
   Enhancing the diversity of plant species in streetscapes would have a
   positive effect on wellbeing, further emphasising the important role
   that biodiverse urban streetscapes play in improving the liveability of
   cities.},

Title = {Collectively planting garden vegetation for biodiversity: Are hard
   surfaced gardens and householder unwillingness a constraint?},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Domestic gardens constitute important refuges for biodiversity. However,
   their typical small size mismatches with the larger scales at which
   species procure resources from urban areas. Consequently, they lack the
   capacity to enhance biodiversity at these scales. This could be
   addressed by aggregating garden resources (e.g. vegetation) and
   increasing garden connectivity. Specifically, this could involve
   neighbouring householders removing brick walls and fences that segregate
   gardens and collectively planting vegetation across garden boundaries.
   Nevertheless, insufficient research has explored 1) how hard surfacing
   gardens influences native/non-native vegetation presence, which could
   influence this action's effectiveness 2) the number of householders
   willing to undertake such action 3) reasons for unwillingness and how
   this could be resolved. These research gaps were addressed using an
   online householder questionnaire distributed weekly to the UK
   `followers' of four Facebook pages from January to December 2014. From a
   total of 276 respondents, 220 (84 \%) had gardens with hard surface and
   this had a significant negative association with native vegetation
   presence. Only 7 (3\%) presently collectively planted vegetation, but
   152 (58 \%) expressed future willingness. Desires to retain garden
   control and privacy predominantly underpinned unwillingness. In order to
   increase the effectiveness and prevalence of collectively planted
   vegetation, more stringent planning policy is required to restrict hard
   surfaced gardens. Moreover, desires for garden control and privacy need
   to be accommodated. This could be principally achieved by 1)
   communicating that little control would be lost as a result of this
   action 2) segregating gardens with hedges, which benefit biodiversity
   and simultaneously provide privacy.},

Title = {Turnover in floral composition explains species diversity and temporal
   stability in the nectar supply of urban residential gardens},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Residential gardens are a valuable habitat for insect pollinators
   worldwide, but differences in individual gardening practices
   substantially affect their floral composition. It is important to
   understand how the floral resource supply of gardens varies in both
   space and time so we can develop evidence-based management
   recommendations to support pollinator conservation in towns and cities.
   We surveyed 59 residential gardens in the city of Bristol, UK, at
   monthly intervals from March to October. For each of 472 garden surveys,
   we combined floral abundances with nectar sugar data to quantify the
   nectar production of each garden, investigating the magnitude, temporal
   stability, and diversity and composition of garden nectar supplies. We
   found that individual gardens differ markedly in the quantity of nectar
   sugar they supply (from 2 to 1,662 g), and nectar production is higher
   in more affluent neighbourhoods, but not in larger gardens. Nectar
   supply peaks in July (mid-summer), when more plant taxa are in flower,
   but temporal patterns vary among individual gardens. At larger spatial
   scales, temporal variability averages out through the portfolio effect,
   meaning insect pollinators foraging across many gardens in urban
   landscapes have access to a relatively stable and continuous supply of
   nectar through the year. Turnover in species composition among gardens
   leads to an extremely high overall plant richness, with 636 taxa
   recorded flowering. The nectar supply is dominated by non-natives, which
   provide 91\% of all nectar sugar, while shrubs are the main plant life
   form contributing to nectar production (58\%). Two-thirds of nectar
   sugar is only available to relatively specialised pollinators, leaving
   just one-third that is accessible to all. Synthesis and applications. By
   measuring nectar supply in residential gardens, our study demonstrates
   that pollinator-friendly management, affecting garden quality, is more
   important than the size of a garden, giving every gardener an
   opportunity to contribute to pollinator conservation in urban areas. For
   gardeners interested in increasing the value of their land to foraging
   pollinators, we recommend planting nectar-rich shrubs with complementary
   flowering periods and prioritising flowers with an open structure in
   late summer and autumn.},

Title = {Community and spatial distribution of bats (Chiroptera,
   Vespertilionidae) in the industrial city of Yekaterinburg},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {89-108},
Abstract = {Bats have been living next to people for a long time, and they have
   successfully inhabited cities. Abundant information on the peculiarities
   of their ecology in urban conditions has been obtained for North
   America, Australia and Europe. Research of this problem for Russia is
   not numerous and is of interest. This paper presents information on the
   population of bats in the large industrial city of Yekaterinburg. The
   main aim is to study the species diversity and spatial distribution of
   bats, taking into account three factors that determine the quality of
   the animal habitat in the city (the presence of areas of woody
   vegetation and water-bodies as a feeding station; various buildings as
   suitable shelters).
   Yekaterinburg is located in Russia, close to the Asian-European border
   (56 degrees 50'N, 60 degrees 35'E.). Animals were observed and captured
   during the warm season using a mobile trap and a MAGENTA ELECTRONICS MK
   II ultrasonic detector (England). Museum materials (Yekaterinburg,
   Russia, Ural Federal University named after B.N.Yeltsin, Sverdlovsk
   Regional Museum, Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology UB RAS - IPAE
   983653, IPAE 773780) were examined. The study was conducted according to
   the guidelines of international and national guidelines, and approved by
   the Ethics Commitee of IPAE UB RAS (protocol.11 29.04.2022). All
   captured animals were released into nature. Residents reported
   information about the distribution of animals (125 detection points of
   bats) for the period 2001-2020. For analysis, two zones of the built-up
   area of the city without forest parks were identified: zone I - the
   center and zone II - the remaining built-up part (See Fig. 1). To
   analyze spatial distribution, distances from the detection points of
   animals to the nearest squares, alleys, parks, forest parks, floodplain
   areas and city water-bodies of various sizes were calculated. In the
   vicinity of encounters and captures, urban buildings are described as
   sites of potential refuges (material, number of storeys). In total, more
   than 110 individuals of 5 species were counted during the surveys (See
   Table 1). The migratory species Vespertilio murinus, and sedentary
   species wintering in Ural caves - Eptesicus nilssonii, Myotis
   daubentonii, M. dasycneme were found in zones I and II. M. brandtii
   (reported by V.E. Polyakov) was found in the forest-park zone. V.
   murinus is predominant, and E. nilssonii is the second largest. Both
   species were found in the city during the warm season (forming brood
   colonies) and, possibly, they overwinter in the city. Most of the bats
   were found near brick and panel 2-16-storey houses (See Fig. 2-a). In
   zone I, the detection points near older 2-6-storey buildings were
   significantly more frequent (chi(2) = 3.7; p < 0.05). In zone II,
   outside the center, the detection points of bats near 9-16 storey
   buildings were significantly more frequent (chi(2) = 6.4; p < 0.05).
   Most detections (81\%) of bats in the city as a whole were observed in
   the immediate vicinity or at a distance of 200-500 m from large parks,
   boulevards, gardens, etc. (See Fig. 2-b). The frequency of detection of
   bats at a distance of more than 1 km from large plantations is
   significantly higher in zone II (7.6\%, chi(2) = 8.9-10.1; p < 0.05). In
   relation to water-bodies, clear dependence in the location of animals
   was not found (See Fig. 2-c). Most often, bats use feeding stations near
   small areas of woody vegetation between residential buildings in yards
   and at a considerable distance from large water-bodies (72\% of cases).
   At these feeding stations (zone I -center), the abundance of insects is
   lower than in their natural habitat (See Fig. 3). The spatial
   distribution of bats is associated with the quality of urban development
   and the presence of areas of woody vegetation, and does not depend on
   the presence of large water-bodies. It can be assumed that these
   distribution patterns of bats are due to the ecology of the background
   species V. murinus. The species diversity of the city's bats is reduced
   in comparison to their natural habitat (5 species out of 10 inhabit
   them). Similar reduction of bat species diversity is noted in other
   cities of Russia and Ukraine (See Table 2).
   It can be assumed that the low bat species diversity in Yekaterinburg is
   an indicator of the poor quality of urban greening.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Access to food is crucial in the life of birds, and affects
   reproduction, survival and, consequently, population size. We
   investigated how traditional care of dogs affected rural birds and other
   animal populations. Using camera traps, it was found that the food fed
   to dogs was also taken by seven species of birds and at least three
   species of mammals. The most numerous species taking dog food was the
   house sparrow, Passer domesticus, which is declining in Europe. In the
   case of this species, females were more likely than males to use food
   provided for dogs, with a clear preference for food prepared in the

   Access to food is crucial in the life of birds and affects reproduction,
   survival and, consequently, population size. In the case of bird species
   inhabiting villages, poorer food conditions now exist, mainly because of
   changes in the lifestyle of rural residents and a reduction in the
   number of farm animals traditionally housed in backyards. Recent changes
   have also affected dog populations in villages, and the majority of them
   are no longer kept outside as guard dogs, but rather inside houses as
   pets. We investigated how traditional care of dogs impacted rural birds
   and other animal populations. The study was carried out at the end of
   winter and early spring in 29 farmsteads in western Poland. Using camera
   traps, it was found that the food fed to dogs was also taken by seven
   species of birds and at least three species of mammals. The most

Title = {Nectar gardens on school grounds reconnect plants, birds and people},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {257},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Pollinators are among the first to be lost when natural habitat is
   reduced to small patches and this can have cascading effects on multiple
   plant species. Simultaneously, the loss of natural habitat cuts people
   off from nature and, when people are out of touch with nature they do
   not care for biodiversity, resulting in further losses. Theoretically,
   the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on pollinators can be
   mitigated by reconnecting isolated conservation areas with stepping
   stones and, if these are located in an urban matrix, they offer
   opportunities for people to reconnect with nature. Here we assess the
   effect of creating stepping stone habitats for nectar-feeding birds
   across Cape Town, South Africa. With the help of pupils, we planted
   gardens of indigenous, bird-pollinated plants at eight schools in the
   urbanized matrix between two conservation areas. To test for change in
   the bird community on school grounds we conducted 398 bird observation
   sessions over a seven-year period. Changes in attitudes and knowledge
   were assessed with questionnaires distributed to 176 pupils. We found
   that, as gardens matured, nectar availability increased and the
   probability of observing a Southern Doublecollared Sunbird (Cinnyris
   chalybeus) on school grounds during a 30 min period increased from 10\%
   to 50\%. Bird species richness increased from -5 to -7 species.
   Questionnaire scores increased by 30\% in participating pupils versus
   8\% in non-participating pupils. Although effects were small, the
   results suggest that it is possible to restore the bird-pollination
   mutualism in cities and in the process reconnect people with nature.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {There is increasing interest in developing urban design principles that
   incorporate good ecological management. Research on understanding the
   distribution and role of beneficial pollinating insects, in particular,
   is changing our view of the ecological value of cities. With the rapid
   expansion of the built environment comes a need to understand how
   insects may be affected in extensive urban areas. We therefore
   investigated insect pollinator capture rates in a rapidly growing and
   densely urbanized city (Melbourne, Australia). We identified a remnant
   native habitat contained within the expansive urban boundary, and
   established study sites at two nearby populated urban areas. We employed
   standard pan trap sampling techniques to passively sample insect orders
   in the different environments. Our results show that, even though the
   types of taxonomic groups of insects captured are comparable between
   locations, important pollinators like bees and hoverflies were more
   frequently captured in the remnant native habitat. By contrast, beetles
   (Coleoptera) and butterflies/moths (Lepidoptera) were more frequently
   observed in the urban residential regions. Our results suggest that the
   maintenance of native habitat zones within cities is likely to be
   valuable for the conservation of bees and the ecosystem services they
   provide.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {61},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The structure of bird communities living in cities may have different
   characteristics depending on the magnitude of building versus green
   area. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of residential
   backyards to the diversity of urban birds in the city of Jacarei, Sa?o
   Paulo, Brazil. We hypothesized that the composition and structure of
   bird communities would change according to (1) backyard, (2)
   neighborhood characteristics, (3) seasonality, and (4) bird species.
   Backyard characteristics assessed include area, vegetation structure
   (number of plant species), tree mean height, number of trees, percent of
   impervious surfaces, and presence of pets, such as dogs and cats. In a
   400 m radius buffer around each backyard we measured the number and
   total area of green spaces, number of neighborhood trees, and nearest
   backyard distance. Surveys were performed during the non-breeding period
   (summer, autumn, and winter). Backyard area, pet presence, and number of
   trees in the neighborhood in which the backyard is located were
   positively correlated with bird richness. In turn, abundance was more
   strongly influenced by the period of visit, number of shrubs above 2 m
   tall, and nearest backyard distance. Our results showed that the
   backyards that present characteristics such as largest area, tallest
   trees and shrubs and that are close to isolated trees and other green
   areas increase the possibilities of species, especially native species,
   to remain in urban areas. Therefore, this study expands our knowledge of
   the effect of urbanization on avian diversity in a typical Latin
   American city inserted in the Atlantic Forest biome and shows the
   importance of private green areas to the composition of the landscape

   Population of Feral Llamas},
Journal = {ANIMALS},

Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Domestic mammals may become invasive alien species when introduced
   within natural environments and when they establish reproductive
   populations. One of the most common pathways of species introduction is
   represented by intentional or accidental escapes from confined
   environments, including zoos, farms and enclosures. A feral population
   of llama Lama glama has been present in Central Italy since 2016 after
   escaping from a zoological garden. In 2020, only three individuals were
   confirmed to be still present within a 40-hectare area, following a
   field survey. We carried out questionnaires with the resident human
   population to determine the local perception and the acceptance of two
   possible management actions, i.e., direct killing and surgical
   sterilization. Llamas are quite docile domestic animals, thus local
   perception was, in general, very positive and also linked to the exotic
   origin of the species, making llamas a welcome observation and a
   pleasant surprise. The observed decline of this population may be due to
   predation by wolves and poaching, together with the lack of suitability
   of natural environment, which may have prevented llamas establishing an
   invasive population. In this context, however, individual removal action
   should be conducted before the population shows a demographic rebound.
   Since 2016, a feral population of llama Lama glama has been present in
   Central Italy after escaping from a zoological garden and starting to
   reproduce. We updated demographic status and distribution of this
   population and investigated societal perception towards the llama
   presence and management in the area through a standard questionnaire.
   Field data were collected through direct (transects traveled by car and
   on foot) and indirect (newspapers, social networks and online platforms)
   research. The feral population appears to be declining. In July 2020,
   the population was represented by three individuals (one male and two
   females), identified also through photoidentification, most likely
   located within a 40-hectare area. The majority of citizens are aware of
   the presence of feral llamas and show a positive attitude toward them
   and a negative one toward management actions. The case of feral llamas
   in Italy is an evident example of unsafe management of a species which
   should have kept in a zoo and which, once set free, was able to catalyze
   the attention of the general public. The decline of this population
   limits the need of drastic management actions that, given the
   appreciation expressed by people and press toward these animals, would
   have been at risk of conflict with the public opinion. Removal action
   should be rapidly taken, i.e., before any demographic rebound and before
   the population becomes a stable feature of the local landscape.},

Title = {Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices Survey in Greece before the
   Implementation of Sterile Insect Technique against Aedes
   albopictus},
Journal = {INSECTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Aedes albopictus, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, tends to breed
   in various artificial containers frequently found in urban areas. Since
   urban areas cannot be easily accessed for the application of control
   measures, community engagement is considered beneficial in vector
   control. The area of Vravrona, Greece was selected for the
   implementation of the sterile insect technique (SIT) against Aedes
   albopictus for the first time in Greece. In the current study, a
   door-to-door campaign was used as a prerelease intervention to raise
   community awareness about SIT and encourage removal of mosquito habitats
   in their yards. A KAP (knowledge, attitude, practices) survey was used
   to collect these data of local community members. Our results
   demonstrate that using the door-to-door campaign as a prerelease method
   can raise community awareness, reduce the initial mosquito population,
   and potentially improve SIT efficacy. The participation of key persons,
   such as scientific experts and municipality members, in the
   implementation of the interventions is crucial for the successful
   engagement of community and may prove important in granting permission
   to enter their private properties for entomological surveillance.
   Community involvement in Aedes albopictus management can be very
   efficient and result in raising awareness among citizens. Toward this
   end, a door-to-door campaign can encourage active community
   participation in vector control. The current study describes the results
   of an intervention where a KAP (knowledge, attitude, practices) survey
   tool was paired with a door-to-door campaign and was implemented as an
   intervention method in Vravrona area (Attica, Greece) before the release
   of sterile males (sterile insect technique, SIT) against Aedes
   albopictus. The KAP tool was used to shed light on the knowledge,
   practices, and attitudes of local community members in order to better
   prepare and motivate participation in household mosquito control and to
   assess current understanding of SIT. Each household also received
   specific information about mosquito source habitat in their own yards at
   the time of the initial KAP survey. These household data were
   complemented by standardized mosquito trapping in the municipality. Our
   findings indicate that citizens' attitude toward SIT ranged from
   indecisive to fully supportive, while 77.5\% of the respondents agreed
   that the SIT has many advantages over chemical control methods.
   Furthermore, the results demonstrate that using the door-to-door
   campaign as an intervention and prerelease method before SIT can
   suppress the initial mosquito population and potentially improve its
   efficacy. Lastly, we show that the presence of local municipality
   officials during door-to-door visits was associated with increased
   willingness from the residents to participate in the intervention.},

Abstract = {Urbanisation is a major cause of biodiversity loss but careful habitat
   management and provision of green space within cities can help to
   mitigate its negative effects. Grasslands occupy large surface areas and
   have many functions but only a few studies have begun to explore how
   birds exploit these habitats in urban contexts. We hypothesized that the
   value of grasslands for nesting and feeding birds is likely to depend
   both on landscape context, and on local characteristics (grassland size,
   use and vegetation structure). We surveyed local habitat
   characteristics, breeding bird presence, abundance and foraging activity
   in 47 grassland sites, distributed along an urban-rural gradient in two
   French cities, and varying in the proportions of grassland, built-up
   land and residential gardens in the neighbouring landscape. Species
   richness was influenced by local rather than landscape variables; larger
   sites with scrub within the grassland and taller hedgerow vegetation
   were more species rich. Total bird abundance, however, depended on
   landscape context, and increased in suburban grasslands with a higher
   proportion of gardens in the landscape. Foraging in grass was more
   frequently observed in shorter, regularly mown, recreational grasslands.
   These were more common in urban contexts and favoured by species
   requiring easily accessible and visible invertebrate prey. Less
   intensively managed wastelands were species rich despite being in urban
   contexts and favoured by seedeaters and one farmland specialist. A
   diversity of use and management of grasslands along the urban-rural
   gradient could allow birds with various requirements to co-exist at
   landscape scale.},

Abstract = {Floral resources (nectar and pollen) provide food for insect pollinators
   but have declined in the countryside due to land use change. Given
   widespread pollinator loss, it is important that we quantify their food
   supply to help develop conservation actions. While nectar resources have
   been measured in rural landscapes, equivalent data are lacking for urban
   areas, an important knowledge gap as towns and cities often host diverse
   pollinator populations.
   We quantified the nectar supply of urban areas, farmland and nature
   reserves in the UK by combining floral abundance and nectar sugar
   production data for 536 flowering plant taxa, allowing us to compare
   landscape types and assess the spatial distribution of nectar sugar
   among land uses within cities.
   The magnitude of nectar sugar production did not differ significantly
   among the three landscapes. In urban areas the nectar supply was more
   diverse in origin and predominantly delivered by non-native flowering
   plants. Within cities, urban land uses varied greatly in nectar sugar
   production. Gardens provided the most nectar sugar per unit area and
   85\% of all nectar at a city scale, while gardens and allotments
   produced the most diverse supplies of nectar sugar. Floral abundance,
   commonly used as a proxy for pollinators' food supply, correlated
   strongly with nectar resources, but left a substantial proportion of the
   variation in nectar supply unexplained.
   Synthesis. We show that urban areas are hotspots of floral resource
   diversity rather than quantity and their nectar supply is underpinned by
   the contribution of residential gardens. Individual gardeners have an
   important role to play in pollinator conservation as ornamental plants,
   usually non-native in origin, are a key source of nectar in towns and
   cities.},

Abstract = {Creating or restoring habitat is a well-established approach to improve
   pollinator populations. Rural and exurban properties might constitute a
   straightforward opportunity to convert land to native plants that are
   beneficial to pollinators given that, in Ohio, these parcels typically
   contain substantial lawn cover. The purpose of this study is to gauge
   the public's acceptance of planting native plants on low-density rural
   properties. Out of 7557 properties in Butler County, Ohio (U.S.A.), that
   had at least 1/4 acre lawn, were between 1 and 20 acres, and had a
   dwelling, 200 were randomly selected to receive a survey; half via the
   drop-off pick-up method and half via mail (for a combined 58\% response
   rate). Pollinator beneficial plants of differing appearance, management,
   and pollinator service were shown in the questionnaire: Echinacea
   purpurea, Monarda fistulosa, Asclepias syriaca, and wildflower prairie
   (multiple species). Respondents were significantly less likely to be
   willing to plant Asclepias syriaca compared to the other plants shown.
   If all respondents planted what they said they would consider planting
   in the more accepted plants, these potentially new plantings would cover
   5.4\% of the 146.2 km(2) devoted to these rural and exurban parcels in
   the county. However, that proportion decreases to 1\% if we only take
   into account those that said they would make those changes within the
   year. We discuss what we see as challenges and opportunities to increase
   pollinator plantings on exurban properties and small working farms in
   the Midwest. We also describe implications for voluntary habitat
   restoration on these private lands.},

   carbon sequestration and particulate matter removal by park and roadside
   trees, drainage service by khals and wetlands, and noise abatement by
   parks. Opportunities for recreation, fishing and sports, walk/exercise,
   inspirations for art and culture and religious values presented cultural

Abstract = {Dentilla velvet ant is a venomous insect of Iran that has different
   species. It has been reported from different parts of the country and is
   responsible for stings in infested places of residential homes.
   Regarding the importance of these bites and because identifying the
   ant's habitats is very important in planning to control it, this study
   was done to identify its habitats in Kashan City, Central of Iran. This
   study was done in a descriptive method. Velvet ant was sampled from 45
   homes in Kashan by census method. The presence of velvet ant was
   confirmed in all 45 infested homes. Sampling was performed 16 times at
   sunset and early evening in the spring and summer. After the diagnosis
   of infestation, activity places of this ant were examined.
   Three hundred thirty four velvet ants were collected From 45 infested
   homes and carpentry workshops. Infested places in homes included a
   courtyard, besides the courtyard wall, in the gap between the mosaics,
   the sides of the garden walls, inside the living room under carpets and
   rugs. The activity of this ant in the bedrooms and living rooms from May
   to September was higher than in other months. The average number of
   caught velvet ant in each sampling was 7.1. In residential areas, the
   most activity of velvet ant was observed inside the panel of the walls.
   It seems that warm weather in Kashan has caused the abundance of velvet
   ants, and as a result entrance to the private living places of humans.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on two early Pleistocene Australopithecus sediba
   hominin specimens and associated fauna from Malapa, South Africa. These
   specimens have been interpreted as having fallen through a shaft opening
   into a cave, where they died and likely mummified, before being washed
   into a lower chamber. In order to better understand the taphonomy of the
   fossils and to identify the invertebrate agent(s) responsible for
   damage, we examined the fossils using high resolution imagery, and
   studied the site and associated breccia blocks in the laboratory for
   traces of invertebrate activity. We also conducted bone modification
   experiments with termites and hide beetles. Results show the presence of
   blowfly puparia within the cranium of the juvenile male (MH1),
   indicating that flies visited the facial orifices of the freshly
   decomposing corpse. Blowflies, which have a requirement to oviposit in
   daylight, imply that the body was exposed to sunlight for part of the
   day. A shaft opening that admitted sunlight is supported by the presence
   of a fossil fungus garden associated with MH2. Fungus gardens occur
   subsurface and sprout mushrooms in areas with dappled light. Analysis of
   the fossil surfaces revealed a pattern comprising 14 damage types that
   were made on relatively fresh bone. A bone modification experiment
   conducted with resident termites at the site showed that they created
   the same suite of microscopic surface features as those observed on the
   fossils. The features are mostly the result of harvesting symbiotic
   fungi from fresh bones and mineral-rich coatings from fossils. Damage
   resulting from the activity of hide beetles is similar to that of
   termites, apart from invasive edge gnawing produced by the beetles. This
   research highlights the importance of insect activity in the
   modification of fossils in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site
   area and calls for consideration of this agent at other fossil sites in
   the region.},

Volume = {194},

Abstract = {Urban green spaces such as gardens often consist of native and exotic
   plant species, which provide pollen and nectar for flower-visiting
   insects. Although some exotic plants are readily visited by pollinators,
   it is unknown if and at which time of the season exotic garden plants
   may supplement or substitute for flower resources provided by native
   plants. To investigate if seasonal changes in flower availability from
   native vs. exotic plants affect flower visits, diversity and
   particularly plant-pollinator interaction networks, we studied
   flower-visiting insects over a whole growing season in 20 urban
   residential gardens in Germany. Over the course of the season, visits to
   native plants decreased, the proportion of flower visits to exotics
   increased, and flower-visitor species richness decreased. Yet, the
   decline in flower-visitor richness over the season was slowed in gardens
   with a relatively higher proportion of flowering exotic plants. This
   compensation was more positively linked to the proportion of exotic
   plant species than to the proportion of exotic flower cover.
   Plant-pollinator interaction networks were moderately specialized.
   Interactions were more complex in high summer, but interaction
   diversity, linkage density, and specialisation were not influenced by
   the proportion of exotic species. Thus, later in the season when few
   native plants flowered, exotic garden plants partly substituted for
   native flower resources without apparent influence on plant-pollinator
   network structure. Late-flowering garden plants support pollinator
   diversity in cities. If appropriately managed, and risk of
   naturalisation is minimized, late-flowering exotic plants may provide
   floral resources to support native pollinators when native plants are
   scarce.},

Abstract = {We conducted research into the `Data Deficient' and endemic Tagula
   HoneyeaterMicroptilotis vicinaof the Louisiade Archipelago, Papua New
   Guinea. This species was only observed on Sudest and Junet Islands.
   Islands were visited between October and January in the years from
   2012-2014 and in 2016. We conducted the first assessment of spatial and
   habitat use by this species using radio-tracking in 2016. These findings
   were also used to inform estimates using traditional population density
   methods. CTMM package in R was used for home-range estimation for the
   tracked honeyeaters. Our results supported that members of this species
   display territoriality during the breeding season, occupying a mean of
   2.0 +/- 0.6 (SE) ha on Junet Island (n=5). Whether individuals defended
   defined territories at other times of the year was not known but
   re-sightings of marked birds confirmed them to be locally resident.
   Population estimates ranged between 53,000 and 85,000 individuals.
   However, more conservative estimates nearing 50,000 individuals were
   considered prudent given lower population densities observed on parts of
   the larger Sudest Island (0.64/ha). This species utilised the canopy and
   understorey layers in a range of habitats from mangroves at sea-level,
   gardens and regrowth of various ages to cloud forest on the highest
   point of Sudest Island (similar to 800 m asl). Dietary observations
   support that like many closely related species, Tagula Honeyeaters have
   a broad diet of mostly insects supplemented with nectar and fruit.
   Observations indicated that this species had life history attributes
   toward the slower end of the spectrum but similar to other congeners.
   Vocalisations were more diverse in both structure and complexity than
   those of suspected close relatives the MimicMicroptilotis analogusand
   Graceful Microptilotis gracilis Honeyeaters. Morphological measures were
   similarly different, supporting species level recognition.},

Title = {Urinary levels of organophosphate pesticides and predictors of exposure
   in pre-school and school children living in agricultural and urban
   communities from south Spain},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background. Despite the widespread use of organophosphate (OP)
   pesticides, information on predictors of children's exposure to such
   pesticides is scarce. Objective. To assess exposure to OP pesticides in
   children 3-11 year-old living in agricultural communities and urban
   areas from Andalusia (Southern Spain), and to identify the main
   determinants of exposure.
   Methods. A longitudinal study was conducted in children 3-11-year-old
   children living in agricultural communities and urban areas from the
   provinces of Almeria, Granada and Huelva (Andalusia, Spain) between 2010
   and 2011. Urinary levels of six dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites were
   measured by UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS at the periods of low and high pesticide use
   in the agriculture (LPU and HPU, respectively). Information on
   sociodemographic characteristics, parental occupation, residential
   history, lifestyle and diet, among other relevant factors, was obtained
   from questionnaires administered to the mothers.
   Results. A total of 559 and 597 children participated in LPU and HPU
   periods, respectively. The proportion of urine samples below LOD was
   67.4\% for Sigma DMs (sum of dimethyl metabolites), 77\% for Sigma DEs
   (sum of diethyl metabolites) and 58.5\% for Sigma DAPs (sum of total
   dialkylphosphate metabolites) in LPU period, and 50.4\% for Sigma DMs,
   65.3\% for Sigma DEs and 43.9\% for Sigma DAPs in HPU period.
   Significantly greater urinary Sigma DAP, Sigma DM and Sigma DE levels
   were observed in HPU relative to LPU period. Maternal schooling years,
   proximity of the house to crops or greenhouses, use of insecticides at
   home, spraying the garden with pesticides, storage of pesticides at
   home, house cleaning frequency, as well as child's frequency of
   bath/shower, were found to be the major predictors of urinary levels of
   Sigma DAP. Likewise, not washing fruit and vegetables before consumption
   and banana consumption were also identified as determinants of the
   exposure levels.
   Conclusions. Urinary levels of metabolites of OP pesticides found in
   this study were relatively lower compared to similar studies. DAP levels
   were significantly increased in HPU period. Maternal schooling years and
   variables related to residential environment and home exposures were
   identified as the most relevant determinants of DAP metabolites.
   Regarding diet, banana consumption and not washing fruit before
   consumption were also identified as determinants of the exposure levels.
   This study contributes to improve our knowledge on the main sources and
   determinants of children exposure to OPS, and given that children are
   more vulnerable than adults this information is essential to reduce
   children exposure and protect their health.},

Abstract = {We report the finding of cysts and larvae of Strongyluris in specimens
   of L. fulica from an urban area of the municipally of Maringa in
   northern Parana State, southern Brazil. Thirty-seven young adult snails
   were collected at three sites: 15 in riparian forest; 14 in a vegetable
   garden; and eight in a residential garden. We found a total of 16 cysts
   with nematode larvae in three of the 15 snails collected in riparian
   forest. The parasites were identified as larvae of the genus
   Strongyluris, which are parasites of the gastrointestinal tract of
   amphibians and reptiles. Lissachatina fulica is established in urban
   areas of 33\% of the municipalities of the state of Parana. The species
   has spread rapidly through the urban area of the municipally of Maringa,
   which may contribute to the transmission of nematode larvae of medical
   and veterinary interest to humans and other animals.},

Title = {Peri-Urban Community Attitudes towards Codling Moth Trapping and
   Suppression Using the Sterile Insect Technique in New Zealand},
Journal = {INSECTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {New, more socially-acceptable technologies are being developed to
   suppress horticultural pests, because suppression is technically
   difficult with current technologies, especially in urban areas. One
   technique involves the release of sterile insects to prevent offspring
   in the next generation. This technology involves aerial or ground
   release systems, but this could also create issues for the public. This
   study investigated community perceptions of a recently-introduced
   response to codling moth control in New Zealand-Sterile Insect Technique
   (SIT). Community attitudes to SIT were examined in Hastings, New
   Zealand, in April, 2018. Eighty-six detailed interviews were undertaken
   with a random sample of households. This community was very willing
   (98\% agreement) to host a sex pheromone trap in their gardens, and
   condoned regular visits to monitor traps. Attitudes to SIT were very
   positive (98\% in favor). Once explained, the concept of using unmanned
   aerial vehicles to deliver sterile insects was also acceptable (98\%) to
   the community. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles to release sterile
   insects during a hypothetical incursion response of an exotic fruit fly
   was also supported at 98\% by respondent householders. Investigation of
   community attitudes can be valuable to guide practitioners in
   determining suitable technologies before an area-wide programme is
   launched.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Previous investigations found elevated mortality after
   breast cancer in association with biomarkers of persistent
   organochlorine pesticides in non-occupationally exposed women. We
   hypothesized that lifetime residential pesticide use, which includes
   persistent and non-persistent pesticides, would also be associated with
   increased mortality after breast cancer.
   Methods: A population-based cohort of 1505 women with invasive or in
   situ breast cancer was interviewed in 1996-1997, shortly after
   diagnosis, about pre-diagnostic lifetime residential pesticide use.
   Participants were followed for mortality through 2014 (595 deaths from
   any cause and 236 from breast cancer, after 17.6 years of follow-up).
   Pesticides were examined as 15 individual categories; a group of seven
   used for lawn and garden purposes; a group of eight used for
   nuisance-pest purposes; and all combined. Cox regression was used to
   estimate hazard ratios (Hits) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for
   all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality. Modification by estrogen
   receptor (ER) status, body mass index, and long-term residence was
   examined.
   Results: Ever use (HR = 0.77, 95\%CI = 0.63-0.95) and higher lifetime
   applications (4th quartile: HR = 0.62, 95\%CI = 0.474.81, P-trend = 0.3)
   of the lawn and garden group of pesticides were inversely associated
   with allcause mortality, compared to never use. The inverse association
   for lawn and garden pesticide use was limited to ER positive (vs.
   negative) tumors (P-interaction = 0.05). Nuisance-pest pesticides, and
   all groups combined, were not associated with all-cause or breast
   cancer-specific mortality.
   Conclusions: Contrary to our hypothesis, lifetime residential use of
   lawn and garden pesticides, but not all combined or nuisance-pest
   pesticides, was inversely associated with all-cause mortality after
   breast cancer.},

Title = {Evaluating the dependence of urban pollinators on ornamental,
   non-native, and `weedy' floral resources},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {293-302},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Urban landscapes are often florally rich due to extensive management of
   cultivated plants around the city. High abundance and diversity of these
   floral resources has been linked to more abundant and diverse pollinator
   communities, but little is known about how urban pollinators select from
   the wide variety of available flowers. This study provides unique
   insight into urban plant-pollinator interactions by examining how many
   plant taxa, and which taxa, are visited by pollinators. Over a
   three-year period, we observed foraging of urban pollinators across 63
   neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois (USA). We observed 1815
   plant-pollinator interactions between 24 pollinator morpho-types and 106
   plant taxa. An additional 57 plant taxa were flowering but not visited
   by pollinators. On average, each pollinator morpho-type visited 19 plant
   taxa, and most pollinators showed generalist tendencies. We identified
   42 plant taxa that were visited by more pollinator morpho-types than
   their floral abundance would predict; we call these `highly attractive'
   plants. In general, perennial and native plants received more pollinator
   visits than their counterparts, and ornamental plants were visited by
   more species than unintentional `weeds'. However, the two most-visited
   plant taxa were non-native, perennial weeds. Our results suggest that
   many flowering plants in cities are not visited by pollinators.
   Furthermore, the plant-pollinator network could be reduced to only four
   plant taxa without losing any pollinator morpho-types. To enhance urban
   pollinator conservation, urban residents can select ornamental plants
   from our list of `highly attractive' plant taxa, or can allow some of
   the highly attractive `weeds' to persist in their gardens.},

Title = {The more things change: species losses detected in Phoenix despite
   stability in bird-socioeconomic relationships},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The science of urban ecology has increasingly grappled with the
   long-term ramifications of a globally urbanized planet and the impacts
   on biodiversity. Some researchers have suggested that places with high
   species diversity in cities simply reflect an extinction debt of
   populations that are doomed to extinction but have not yet disappeared.
   The longitudinal studies conducted to date have found species
   composition shifting with urbanization but have not always documented
   continued species extirpations post-urbanization. We used long-term
   monitoring data on birds from the greater metropolitan area of Phoenix,
   Arizona, to measure changes in residential bird communities,
   species-habitat relationships, and human perceptions of bird species
   diversity over a five-year period. Bird richness, occupancy, and
   abundance decreased, as did the percentage of respondents satisfied with
   bird variety in their neighborhoods. As in previous analyses for this
   region, we found that desert specialist species were associated with
   neighborhoods with xeric landscaping consisting of gravel groundcover,
   and drought-tolerant, desert-adapted vegetation. These species were also
   found in neighborhoods with high per capita income rates and lower
   percentages of renters and I Iispanic/Latinx residents. Non-native
   species were positively associated with neighborhoods containing mesic
   yards with grass and other water-intensive vegetation. The proportions
   of yards in our surveyed neighborhoods with these distinct landscaping
   types likewise remained relatively stable over five-year period.
   Although habitat-species relationships remained unchanged, we detected
   significant loss of species across the sampling period. Declines were
   not confined to desert specialist species but included generalist and
   invader species as well. The parallel reduction in residents'
   satisfaction suggests that people perceive some aspect of this
   environmental degradation. Further investigation into the mechanisms
   underlying these species losses may reveal options for retaining some
   desert specialist species, and the uniqueness they contribute to urban
   fauna.},

   landscapes},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {647},
Pages = {420-430},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Urban expansion is correlated to negative biodiversity trends. The
   amount of impervious surfaces in urban areas is a determinant of
   pollinator species assemblages. While the increase in urbanization and
   impervious surfaces negatively impacts pollinators, cities also
   encompass urban green spaces, which have a significant capacity to
   support biodiversity. Among them, domestic gardens that represent a
   non-negligible fraction of green spaces have been shown to benefit
   pollinators. Domestic gardens may form habitat clusters in residential
   areas, although their value at a landscape scale is still unknown. Here,
   we investigate the combined effects of impervious surfaces and domestic
   garden areas on pollinator richness. Due to the difficulty of accessing
   privately owned domestic gardens, we chose to use citizen science data
   from a well-established French citizen science program known as SPIPOLL.
   Using regression tree analysis on buffers located from 50m to 1000m
   around the data points, we show the importance of pollinators being in
   close proximity to domestic gardens as locally favorable habitats that
   are embedded within a landscape, in which impervious surfaces represent
   unfavorable areas. We highlight the inter-connection between local and
   landscape scales, the potential for patches of domestic gardens in
   residential areas, and the need to consider the potential of gardeners'
   coordinated management decisions within a landscape context. (C) 2018

Journal = {JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {49},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Biological communities are increasingly faced with novel urban habitats
   and their response may depend on a combination of biological and habitat
   traits. The response of pollinator species to urban habitats are of
   particular importance because all species involved in the pollination
   mutualism may be affected. Nectarivorous bird communities worldwide show
   varying tolerances to urban areas, but studies from Africa are lacking.
   We investigated nectarivorous bird communities in a medium-sized South
   African city and asked which biological and garden traits best predict
   the community assembly of specialist and opportunistic nectarivorous
   birds. Information was collected on garden traits and the frequency of
   nine nectarivorous bird species for 193 gardens by means of a
   questionnaire. Information on biological traits of birds was obtained
   from published literature. Habitat generalism and tree nesting were
   identified as the most important biological traits influencing bird
   occurrence in gardens. A greater diversity of indigenous bird-pollinated
   plants and the presence of sugar water feeders increased the numbers of
   nectar specialist birds and species richness of nectarivorous birds.
   While bird baths increased the species richness of nectar specialist
   birds, opportunistic birds' urban adjustment was further facilitated by
   large vegetated areas in gardens and limited by the distance to the
   nearest natural habitat. In conclusion, though some biological traits
   and dispersal barriers seem to limit urban adjustment, a combination of
   natural and artificial nectar resource provisioning could facilitate
   this adjustment.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Hedgerows, flowering strips, and natural areas that are adjacent to
   agricultural land have been shown to benefit crop production, via the
   provision of insect pollinators that pollinate crops. However, we do not
   yet know the extent to which bee habitat in the form of urban gardens
   might contribute to pollination services in surrounding crops. We
   explored whether gardens might provision pollinators to adjacent
   agricultural areas by sampling bees from gardens in the Portland, Oregon
   metropolitan area, and estimating typical foraging distances in the
   context of commercial- and residential-scale pollination-dependent crops
   up to 1000 m from garden study sites. We estimate that garden bees could
   forage outside of the garden in which they were collected, and that when
   pollination-dependent crops (commercial-scale or residential-scale) are
   nearby, 30-50\% of the garden bee community could potentially provide
   pollination services to adjacent crops, if urban bees readily cross
   boundaries and forage among habitat types. Urban gardens might thus be
   well-positioned to provision neighboring farms and food gardens with
   pollination services, or could serve as a refuge for pollinators when
   forage is scarce or crop management practices are inhospitable. The
   actual capacity of gardens to serve as a refuge for pollinators from
   agricultural fields depends upon the extent to which bees forage across
   habitat types. However, relatively little is known about the degree to
   which bees move among habitat patches in heterogeneous landscapes. We
   thus propose a research agenda that can document the extent to which
   gardens contribute to pollinator health and pollination services at the
   interface of urban, peri-urban, and rural landscapes. In particular,
   more data is needed on how landscape context impedes or promotes garden
   bee movement between habitat types.},

   diversity in suburban yards},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {221},
Pages = {160-174},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Green spaces embedded within the urban matrix, particularly residential
   yards, could mitigate negative aspects of urban development and provide
   pollinator habitat. Lawns represent a dominant green space, and their
   management consists of frequent mowing to inhibit the growth of
   ostensibly ``weedy{''} species (e.g., dandelions and clover). Since
   widespread population declines of bees and other pollinators from
   habitat loss are a growing concern, these spontaneous flowers could
   provide pollen and nectar sources throughout the growing season. We
   experimentally tested whether different lawn mowing frequencies (1, 2 or
   3 weeks) influenced bee abundance and diversity in 16 suburban western
   Massachusetts yards by increasing lawn floral resources. Lawns mowed
   every three weeks had as much as 2.5 times more lawn flowers than the
   other frequencies. Interestingly, lawns mowed every two weeks supported
   the highest bee abundance yet the lowest bee richness and evenness. We
   suggest these patterns were driven by a combination of more abundant
   floral resources (compared with 1-week yards), easier access to lawn
   flowers due to shorter grass and a more drastic impact on grass biomass
   and floral resources (compared with 3-week yards), and the dominance of
   a few generalist bees overwhelming our samples, thus driving richness
   and evenness. Our results highlight a ``lazy lawnmower{''} approach to
   providing bee habitat. Mowing less frequently is practical, economical,
   and a timesaving alternative to lawn replacement or even planting
   pollinator gardens. Given the pervasiveness of lawns coupled with
   habitat loss, our findings provide immediate solutions for individual
   households to contribute to urban conservation.},

Abstract = {For conservation ecologists, the justification for restoration that

   can also be driven by the perceived direct impacts on people. Our case
   study reports on the ecological and human perspectives that drove the
   decision to control yellow crazy ants in Atafu, Tokelau. We surveyed the
   effects of yellow crazy ants at varying abundance on attitudes of
   people, diversity of ant communities, and white tern nesting behaviour
   in Atafu. Direct effects of yellow crazy ants on people included
   complaints that they `ruined the garden', ate the `food for pigs that is
   kept outside', and residents in areas with high ant infestations `can't
   sleep outside anymore'. Yellow crazy ant abundance was positively
   correlated with both negative impacts on common ant species and the
   concern people expressed over the effects of the ant on their lives, but
   was not associated with differences in ant species richness or
   invertebrate diversity. We also found that yellow crazy ant abundance
   was negatively associated with the reproductive output of white terns.
   In addition, we found that people and white terns were more sensitive
   than ant communities to the effects of yellow crazy ants when the ants
   were at lower abundance. Based on our surveys of impacts on the
   villagers and biodiversity values on Atafu, the decision was made to
   embark on a control program, which was predicted to benefit both people

   (Passer domesticus)?},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {124-130},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As a species closely associated with people and urban areas, the house
   sparrow (Passer domesticus) was expected to prosper with increased
   urbanization. Over the past few decades, however, house sparrow
   populations have decreased in many towns and cities around the world.
   The most commonly mentioned reasons for these decreases are lack of
   food, especially invertebrates, and fewer nesting sites and shelters.
   Given the need to evaluate the role of newly built homes and their
   effect on sparrow habitat, our overall goal was to evaluate if new
   housing areas are inhabited with a lower density of house sparrows than
   old housing areas and, if so, to identify factors responsible for the
   differences. We carried out observations in 60 small settlements in the
   greater municipal area of Prague, Czech Republic. Our results indicate
   house sparrows' high preference for old parts of settlements and
   unsuitability of newly built-up areas. Backyard poultry's presence and
   sufficient green space were both important factors related to house
   sparrow abundances. Specifically, house sparrow abundance was highest in
   sites with 20\% to 30\% greenery cover (trees and shrubs) and they
   exploited sites that had backyard poultry. We found no effect of other
   granivorous birds acting as competitors. Instead, house sparrow
   abundance was higher where another granivorous species were present. As
   a measure to sustain greater biodiversity in modern housing development,
   we suggest increasing trees and shrubs cover in newly built-up areas to
   a minimum of 20\%.},

Abstract = {Specialized relationships between animals and plants are the norm in
   nature rather than the exception and landscape designs that destroy them
   also degrade local ecosystem function. Plants that evolved in concert
   with local animals provide for their needs better than plants that
   evolved elsewhere. The most common and arguably most important
   specialized relationships are those that have developed between insect
   herbivores and their host plants. Here, I explain why this is so, why
   specialized food relationships determine the stability and complexity of
   the local food webs that support animal diversity, and why our yards and
   gardens are essential parts of the ecosystems that sustain us. I also
   discuss how we can use our residential and corporate landscapes to
   connect the isolated habitat fragments around us and produce valuable
   ecosystem services, and what we can do to make our landscapes living
   ecosystems once again.},

Title = {Distributions and determinants of urinary biomarkers of organophosphate
   pesticide exposure in a prospective Spanish birth cohort study},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Background: Prenatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides (OPs) has
   been associated with impaired child development. Pesticide exposure
   determinants need to be studied in order to identify sources and
   pathways of pesticide exposure. The aim of this paper is to describe
   prenatal exposure to OPs and evaluate the associated factors in pregnant
   women.
   Methods: The study population consisted of pregnant women (n = 573) who
   participated in the INMA birth cohort study in Valencia (Spain,
   2003-2006). OP metabolites were analyzed in maternal urine at the 32nd
   week of gestation using a liquid chromatography-high resolution mass
   spectrometry method. The analysis included non-specific (diethyl
   phosphate {[}DEP], diethyl thiophosphate {[}DETP], dimethyl
   thiophosphate {[}DMTP], dimethyl dithiophosphate {[}DMDTP]) and specific
   metabolites (2-diethylamino-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinol {[}DEAMPY],
   2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine {[}IMPY], para-nitrophenol
   {[}PNP], and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol {[}TCPY]). Information about
   the sociodemographic, environmental, and dietary characteristics was
   obtained by questionnaire. The association between log-transformed OPs
   and covariates was analyzed using multivariable interval censored
   regression.
   Results: The detection frequencies were low, DMTP and TCPY being the
   most frequently detected metabolites (53.8\% and 39.1\%, respectively).
   All the OP metabolites were positively associated with maternal intake
   of fruits and vegetables. Other maternal characteristics related to the
   OPs were body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy and smoking habit during
   pregnancy. Women with lower BMI and those who did not smoke presented
   higher OP concentrations. Moreover, mothers who had a yard or garden
   with plants at home or who lived in an urban area were also more exposed
   to OPs.
   Conclusions: The OP detection frequencies and the concentrations
   observed in our study population were low, compared with most of the
   previously published studies. Given the high vulnerability of the fetus
   to neurotoxicant exposure, further research on the determinants of the
   body burden of OPs during pregnancy would be necessary. The knowledge
   gained from such studies would enhance the effectiveness of public
   health control and future recommendations in order to reduce the risk to
   both the health of pregnant women and the health and development of
   their children.},

Title = {Outdoor spatial spraying against dengue: A false sense of security among
   inhabitants of Hermosillo, Mexico},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background
   Government-administered adulticiding is frequently conducted in response
   to dengue transmission worldwide. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
   spraying may create a ``false sense of security' for residents. Our
   objective was to determine if there was an association between
   residents' reporting outdoor spatial insecticide spraying as way to
   prevent dengue transmission and both their reported frequency of dengue
   prevention practices and household entomological indices in Hermosillo,
   Mexico.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   A non-probabilistic survey of 400 households was conducted in August
   2014. An oral questionnaire was administered to an adult resident and
   the outer premises of the home were inspected for water-holding
   containers and presence of Ae. aegypti larvae and pupae. Self-reported
   frequency of prevention practices were assessed among residents who
   reported outdoor spatial spraying as a strategy to prevent dengue (n =
   93) and those who did not (n = 307). Mixed effects negative binomial
   regression was used to assess associations between resident's reporting
   spraying as a means to prevent dengue and container indices. Mixed
   effects logistic regression was used to determine associations with
   presence/absence of larvae and pupae. Those reporting spatial spraying
   disposed of trash less frequently and spent less time indoors to avoid
   mosquitoes. They also used insecticides and larvicides more often and
   covered their water containers more frequently. Their backyards had more
   containers positive for Ae. aegypti (RR = 1.92) and there was a higher
   probability of finding one or more Ae. aegypti pupae (OR = 2.20). Survey
   respondents that reported spatial spraying prevented dengue were more
   likely to be older and were exposed to fewer media sources regarding
   prevention.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The results suggest that the perception that outdoor spatial spraying
   prevents dengue is associated with lower adoption of prevention
   practices and higher entomological risk. This provides some support to
   the hypothesis that spraying may lead to a ``false sense of
   security{''}. Further investigations to clarify this relationship should
   be conducted. Government campaigns should emphasize the difficulty in
   controlling Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and the need for both government and
   community action to minimize risk of dengue transmission.},

Title = {Meteorological and landscape influences on pollen beetle immigration
   into oilseed rape crops},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {241},
Pages = {150-159},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Heavy reliance on pesticide inputs to maintain crop yields has been an
   important aspect of agricultural intensification. Insecticide use has
   had detrimental impacts on pollinators and natural pest control agents,
   contributing to a decline in associated ecosystem services, and has also
   led to resistance development in pest populations. Throughout Europe, in
   oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) crops, prophylactic use of insecticides
   against pollen beetles (Meligethes aeneus F. also known as
   Brassicogethes aeneus) has led to such issues, and there is an urgent
   need to develop more sustainable pest management practices for the crop.
   Although advice is available to oilseed rape growers regarding control
   thresholds, it may not be adhered to due to the expense of pollen beetle
   monitoring relative to the inexpensive cost of pyrethroid insecticides.
   Thus, the key to reducing prophylactic insecticide applications may lie
   with improved, less labour intensive methods of pollen beetle
   monitoring. For these to be realized, a better understanding is needed
   of the effects of agri-landscape features and meteorological conditions
   on pollen beetle immigration into the crop. In this study, based on data
   from four years of pollen beetle monitoring on a total of 41 field
   sites, we model the effects of meteorological (wind speed and direction,
   rainfall and accumulated temperature) and landscape (areas of woodland,
   residential gardens, the current and previous seasons' oilseed rape
   crops, and lengths of hedgerows and treelines) variables on directional
   sticky trap catches, at both the single trap and field scales.
   Meteorological variables, particularly accumulated temperature and wind
   speed were more important than landscape variables in predicting the
   abundance of pollen beetles immigrating into OSR fields. Sticky traps
   that were facing downwind caught more beetles than those that were
   facing across-wind or upwind; this is the first study to show at a
   landscape-scale, direct evidence for use of upwind anemotaxis by pollen
   beetles at the point of entry during immigration into the crop. At the
   field scale, the area of oilseed rape grown in the previous season was
   found to be positively related to trap catch, but no relationships with
   other landscape variables were found. Optimally-placed monitoring traps
   could complement existing decision support systems to reduce pollen
   beetle monitoring effort and encourage use of insecticides only when
   control thresholds are breached, thus enhancing the sustainability of
   oilseed rape production. Knowledge of the area of oilseed rape crops
   grown during the previous season in the surrounding landscape could
   contribute to risk assessment of potential pest pressure for individual
   OSR crops. (C) 2017 Rothamsted Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Cultural significance of termites in sub-Saharan Africa},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JAN 26},
Abstract = {Background: The number of termite species in the world is more than
   2500, and Africa with more than 1000 species has the richest
   intercontinental diversity. The family Termitidae contains builders of
   great mounds up to 5 m high. Colonies are composed of casts: a queen, a
   king, soldiers and workers. Some species of termite cultivate
   specialised fungi to digest cellulose. Termites constitute 10\% of all
   animal biomass in the tropics. The purpose of the study was to make an
   overview of how termites are utilized, perceived and experienced in
   daily life across sub-Saharan Africa.
   Method: Ethno-entomological information on termites (Isoptera) in
   sub-Saharan Africa was collected by: (1) interviews with more than 300
   people from about 120 ethnic groups from 27 countries in the region; (2)
   library studies in Africa, London, Paris and Leiden.
   Results: Vernacular names relate to mounds, insects as food, the
   swarming, and the behaviour of termites. Swarming reproductive, soldiers
   and queens are collected as food. There are many different ways to
   harvest them. Termites can also be used as feed for poultry or as bait
   to catch birds and fish. The mushrooms that grow each year from the
   fungus gardens on the termite mounds are eaten. The soldiers, the fungus
   gardens and the soil of termite mounds are used for multiple medicinal
   purposes. Mounds and soil of termites have numerous functions: for
   geochemical prospecting, making bricks, plastering houses, making pots,
   and for storage. Termite soil is often used as fertilizer. The act of
   eating soil (geophagy) among women, especially those that are pregnant,
   is practised all over Africa. The mounds can serve as burying places and
   are often associated with the spiritual world, especially containing the
   spirits of ancestors. Termites also play a role as oracle, in
   superstitious beliefs, in art and literature.
   Conclusion: The following characteristics make termites so appealing:
   the dominance in the landscape, the social organization, the destructive
   power, and the provision of food. The study shows that termites play a
   major role in peoples' lives, in physical as well as spiritual aspects.},

Abstract = {Urban neighborhoods vary in development intensity and in the life style

   affect plant communities, their functional characteristics, and the
   floral resources they provide. We recorded flowers in front-facing yards
   in 58 neighborhoods in Chicago, IL (USA) and examined patterns in
   community composition and species turnover between neighborhoods. We
   investigated how species richness and plant characteristics, including
   origin, cultivation intent, and life cycle, are affected by neighborhood
   socioeconomic factors. Urban plant species tended to be perennial,
   ornamental, and non-native. White clover had the broadest distribution
   and the highest floral abundance but was not present in several of the
   highest-income neighborhoods. Although we found 144 morpho-species
   across neighborhoods, most occurred infrequently. Species turnover was
   highest for ornamental species and lowest for weedy species, suggesting
   that intentional plantings are driving beta diversity across the
   landscape. We found the highest species richness in neighborhoods with
   intermediate numbers of Hispanic and white residents and with
   intermediate number of residential lots; neighborhoods with racially or
   ethnically homogenous populations had fewer plant species. The high
   frequency of weeds in low-income neighborhoods, the occurrence of
   certain ornamental plant species in whiter, wealthier communities, and
   high turnover of species from one neighborhood to another, all suggest a
   disparity in plant-related ecosystem services across cities. Complexity
   in urban plantings may be influenced by the suite of perspectives that
   residents bring towards habitat management. Cultivation sustains a
   diversity of plants and creates a disparity in plant traits by
   neighborhood socioeconomics.},

Abstract = {Private yards comprise a significant component of urban lands, with
   managed lawns representing the dominant land cover. Lawns blanket >
   163,000 km(2) of the United States, and 50\% of urban and suburban
   areas. When not treated with herbicides, lawns have the capacity to
   support a diversity of spontaneous (e.g., not planted) flowers, with the
   potential to provide nectar and pollen resources for pollinators such as
   native bees. In order to determine the extent to which suburban lawns
   support these important species, we surveyed lawns in 17 suburban yards
   in Springfield, MA, between May and September 2013 and 2014.
   Householders participating in the study did not apply chemical
   pesticides or herbicides to lawns for the duration of the study. We
   collected 5,331 individual bees, representing 111 species, and 29\% of
   bee species reported for the state. The majority of species were native
   to North America (94.6\%), nested in soil (73\%), and solitary (48.6\%).
   Species richness was lower for oligolectic (specialists on a single
   plant; 9.9\%) and parasitic species (12.6\%). Abundance percentages for
   number of individuals were similar. We documented 63 plant species in
   the lawns, the majority of which were not intentionally planted. The
   most abundant lawn flowers were dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and
   clover (Trifolium sp.). Nearly 30\% of the spontaneous plant species
   growing in the lawns were native to North America. Our study suggests
   that the spontaneous lawn flowers could be viewed as supplemental floral
   resources and support pollinators, thereby enhancing the value of urban
   green spaces.},

Abstract = {Plantings in residential neighborhoods can support wild pollinators.
   However, it is unknown how effectively wild pollinators maintain
   pollination services in small, urban gardens with diverse floral
   resources. We used a `mobile garden' experimental design, whereby potted
   plants of cucumber, eggplant, and purple coneflower were brought to 30
   residential yards in Chicago, IL, USA, to enable direct assessment of
   pollination services provided by wild pollinator communities. We
   measured fruit and seed set and investigated the effect of within-yard
   characteristics and adjacent floral resources on plant pollination.
   Increased pollinator visitation and taxonomic richness generally led to
   increases in fruit and seed set for all focal plants. Furthermore, fruit
   and seed set were correlated across the three species, suggesting that
   pollination services vary across the landscape in ways that are
   consistent among different plant species. Plant species varied in terms
   of which pollinator groups provided the most visits and benefit for
   pollination. Cucumber pollination was linked to visitation by small
   sweat bees (Lasioglossum spp.), whereas eggplant pollination was linked
   to visits by bumble bees. Purple coneflower was visited by the most
   diverse group of pollinators and, perhaps due to this phenomenon, was
   more effectively pollinated in florally-rich gardens. Our results
   demonstrate how a diversity of wild bees supports pollination of
   multiple plant species, highlighting the importance of pollinator
   conservation within cities. Non-crop resources should continue to be
   planted in urban gardens, as these resources have a neutral and
   potentially positive effect on crop pollination.},

Abstract = {Domestic cats (Felis catus) have caused the extinction of many island
   species and are thought to kill many billions of birds and mammals in
   the continental United States each year. However, the spatial
   distribution and abundance of cats and their risk to our protected areas
   remains unknown. We worked with citizen scientists to survey the mammals
   at 2,117 sites in 32 protected areas and one urban area across 6 states
   in the eastern United States using camera traps. We found that most
   protected areas had high levels of coyote (Canis latrans) activity, but
   few or no domestic cats. The relative abundance of domestic cats in
   residential yards, where coyotes were rare, was 300 times higher than in
   the protected areas. Our spatial models of cat distribution show the
   amount of coyote activity and housing density are the best predictors of
   cat activity, and that coyotes and cats overlap the most in small urban
   forests. Coyotes were nocturnal at all sites, while cats were nocturnal
   in protected areas, but significantly more diurnal in urban sites. We
   suggest that the ecological impact of free-ranging cats in the region is
   concentrated in urban areas or other sites, such as islands, with few
   coyotes. Our study also shows the value of citizen science for

   Collembola, Diptera, and Araneae were most frequently collected in lawns
   and Isopoda in open beds.
   3. The use of pesticides had no effect on total trap catch, but
   detritivore numbers were higher in gardens where no insecticide had been
   used. Opiliones and Acarina were captured in greater numbers in gardens
   where herbicides had not been used.
   4. Over 1400 Coleoptera were identified to 164 species/morphospecies.
   Species richness averaged 12 species per garden. Staphylinidae,
   Curculionidae, and Carabidae were the most abundantly collected
   Coleoptera, both for species and individuals. Species richness was not
   affected by vegetation type. The coleopteran fauna was predominantly
   native (80-90\%) for species and individuals.
   5. The capture of a new to New Zealand weevil species (Exomias
   pellicidus (Boheman)) suggests that urban studies could play a role in
   alerting authorities to biosecurity incursions. The study stimulated
   considerable interest in invertebrates from householders, which might
   help fill the gap between acquiring environmental awareness and
   encouraging changes in behaviour towards support for native
   biodiversity.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to investigate the role of outdoor
   housing environment (OHE), including front and back gardens, yards,
   courtyards, patios and balconies, in older people's well-being.
   Descriptions of their OHEs were collected from 2558 individuals living
   in 526 distinct housing developments using a postal questionnaire. A
   large range of background variables were measured, mainly through the
   questionnaire. Characteristics of respondents' immediate neighbourhood
   environments were measured from digital maps and satellite/bird's-eye
   images. Among the OHE variables, statistically significant predictors of
   well-being were having one's own patio (as opposed to shared or none),
   and having a green view from one's living area (a positive effect on
   well-being). The authors conclude that it would be beneficial for older
   people's housing to include private patio space, where possible, as well
   as a large amount of greenery. The research supports the claim that
   older people benefit from green space as much by viewing it from inside
   as spending time in it. If older people have no or very little garden
   space, a green street environment is likely to increase their
   well-being, especially if it can be seen from their home.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {187},
Pages = {240-248},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Networks of urban green space can provide critical resources for wild
   bees, however it is unclear which attributes of green spaces provide
   these resources, or how their management can be improved to benefit a
   diversity of bee species. We examined bee communities in three dominant
   urban green space habitats: (1) golf courses (2) public parks and (3)
   front gardens and streetscapes in residential neighbourhoods in
   Melbourne, Australia and assessed which local and landscape attributes
   influenced bee communities. There was a greater abundance and richness
   of bee species in public parks compared to golf courses and residential
   neighbourhoods, where the latter habitat was dominated by European
   Honeybees (Apis mellifera). The occurrence of A. mellifera was
   positively associated with increases in flowering and native plants.
   Ground-nesting Homalictus species occurred more frequently in older golf
   courses and public parks surrounded by low impervious surface cover, and
   with a low diversity of flowering plants. Cavity nesting, floral
   specialists within the Colletidae family occurred more often in green
   space habitats with greater native vegetation, and occurred infrequently
   in residential neighbourhoods. The lack of appropriate nesting habitat
   and dominance of exotic flowering plants in residential neighbourhoods
   appeared to positively impact upon the generalist A. mellifera, but
   negatively affected cavity and ground nesting floral specialist bee
   species (e.g. Halictidae and Colletidae). Our results highlight the need
   to include urban areas in pollinator conservation initiatives, as
   providing resources critical to diverse bee communities can assist in
   maintaining these key pollinators in urban landscapes. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Widespread supplementary feeding in domestic gardens explains the return
   of reintroduced Red Kites Milvus milvus to an urban area},
Journal = {IBIS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {157},
Number = {2},
Pages = {230-238},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Reintroductions are commonly used to mitigate biodiversity loss. One
   prominent example is that of the Red Kite Milvus milvus, a charismatic
   raptor of conservation concern. This species has been reintroduced
   across the UK over the last 25years following its near extinction after
   centuries of persecution. The species was not expected to recolonize
   urban areas; its historical association with human settlements is
   attributed to scavenging on human waste and refuse, a resource now
   greatly reduced on the streets of modern European cities. However, the
   species has become a common daytime visitor to a large conurbation
   centred on the town of Reading, southern England, approximately 20km
   from the first English reintroduction site. Given a near-absence of
   breeding and roost sites, we investigated foraging opportunities and
   habitat associations that might explain use by Red Kites of this urban
   area. Surveys of discarded human foods and road-kill suggested that
   these could support at most 13-29 Kites per day. Face-to-face surveys of
   a cross-section of residents revealed that 4.5\% (equivalent to 4349
   households) provided supplementary food for Red Kites in their gardens.
   Using estimates of per-household resource provision from another study,
   we calculated that this is potentially sufficient to feed 142-320 Kites,
   a substantial proportion of the total estimated to visit the conurbation
   each day (between 140 and 440). Road transects found positive
   associations between Red Kites and residential areas. We suggest that
   the decision made by thousands of householders to provide supplementary
   food for Red Kites in their gardens is the primary factor explaining
   their daytime abundance in this urban area.},

Title = {Associations between self-reported pest treatments and pesticide
   concentrations in carpet dust},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Background: Recent meta-analyses demonstrate an association between
   self-reported residential pesticide use and childhood leukemia risk.
   Self-reports may suffer from recall bias and provide information only on
   broad pesticide categories. We compared parental self-reported home and
   garden pest treatments to pesticides measured in carpet dust.
   Methods: Parents of 277 children with leukemia and 306 controls in
   Northern and Central California (2001-2007) were asked about insect and
   weed treatments during the previous year. Carpet dust samples were
   analyzed for 47 pesticides. We present results for the 7 insecticides
   (carbaryl, propoxur, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin,
   permethrin), 5 herbicides (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid {[}2,4-D],
   chlorthal, dicamba, mecoprop, simazine), and 1 synergist (piperonyl
   butoxide) that were present in home and garden products during the study
   period and were detected in >= 25\% of carpet dust samples. We
   constructed linear regression models for the relative change in
   pesticide concentrations associated with self-reported treatment of pest
   types in cases and controls separately and combined, adjusting for
   demographics, housing characteristics, and nearby agricultural pesticide
   applications.
   Results: Several self-reported treatments were associated with pesticide
   concentrations in dust. For example, households with flea/tick
   treatments had 2.3 (95\% Confidence Interval {[}CI]: 1.4, 3.7) times
   higher permethrin concentrations than households not reporting this
   treatment. Households reporting treatment for ants/cockroaches had 2.5
   (95\% CI: 1.5, 4.2) times higher cypermethrin levels than households not
   reporting this treatment. Weed treatment by a household member was
   associated with 1.9 (1.4, 2.6), 2.2 (1.6, 3.1), and 2.8 (2.1, 3.7) times
   higher dust concentrations of dicamba, mecoprop, and 2,4-D,
   respectively. Weed treatments by professional applicators were
   null/inversely associated with herbicide concentrations in dust.
   Associations were generally similar between cases and controls and were
   consistent with pesticide active ingredients in these products during
   the study time period.
   Conclusions: Consistency between self-reported pest treatments,
   concentrations in dust, and pesticides in products lends credibility to
   the exposure assessment methods and suggests that differential recall by
   case-control status is minimal.},

   arid South Sinai},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {110-115},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In temperate and tropical regions agricultural conversion of natural
   habitat typically has negative impacts upon the diversity and functional
   complexity of bird communities. In arid environments however, the
   irrigation associated with agricultural can lead to an increase in local
   abundances of plant and insect resources, so has the potential to
   benefit bird communities. South Sinai is a key migratory corridor for
   many birds making the annual journey from wintering sites in Africa to
   breeding sites in Europe. We assess the importance of traditional
   Bedouin agricultural gardens for both resident and migratory species by
   comparing the density and functional composition of birds within the
   irrigated gardens to those in the unmanaged desert habitat. Estimated
   bird densities were significantly higher within the gardens than the
   unmanaged habitat, with a higher estimated species richness within the
   gardens. Functional composition of bird communities differed between the
   two habitats, with gardens supporting a higher proportion of
   insectivorous and migratory birds in addition to the resident desert
   species that were associated with the unmanaged habitat. Migratory
   species were almost entirely absent from the unmanaged habitat,
   suggesting that this region may not be used as a migratory stop-off if
   not for the presence of traditional agricultural gardens. Crown

Title = {Paederus beetles: the agent of human dermatitis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Background: Rove beetles of the genus Paederus cause dermatitis when
   they come in contact with human skin. This condition is prevalent in
   some tropical and subtropical regions, such as in northern Pakistan,
   where it was recorded for the first time by US troops. Despite much
   research from other countries on this subject, few studies, mostly
   clinical, have been performed in a Pakistani context. A survey was
   carried out in villages, towns and cities of Punjab province, Pakistan,
   to explore the rove beetle population dynamics and to develop a model to
   elucidate the symptoms, preventive measures and treatment strategies for
   this dermatitis.
   Methods: The prospective observational and patient surveys were
   performed bimonthly over a period of two years, in different districts
   of Punjab province. Collection was carried out in fields, gardens and
   houses during every visit with the aid of a pitfall trap, light trap,
   flight intercept trap, Berlese funnel trap and sweep netting. These
   traps were installed for four days during every visit. Interviews of ten
   individuals of different ages and sexes from each site were recorded
   during each visit.
   Results: Out of 980 individuals, 26.4\% were found to suffer from
   Paederus dermatitis. Lesions were most commonly found on the neck
   followed by the face. In July-August during the rainy season, this skin
   irritation was most prevalent and the population of these beetles peaked
   (36.2\%). During May-June, the beetle population was lowest (7.85\%) due
   to soil dryness. About 70\% of such irritation cases were from
   individuals living in farming villages or in farmhouses. Their houses
   typically (80\%) had broken doors and screen-less windows while 97\% of
   the residents were unaware of how they may have come into contact with
   these beetles. In most cases (91\% from villages/small towns and 24\%
   from cities and adjoining areas) the local residents were unaware of
   modern treatment strategies.
   Conclusions: Paederus dermatitis is extremely frequent in villages with
   poor housing facilities and could be avoided via community awareness.},

Abstract = {Capsule Bird communities are better conserved in vineyards with
   mechanically managed herbaceous cover corridors. Aims To determine the
   advantages of herbaceous cover corridors for the conservation of
   farmland birds. Methods We studied birds in three vineyards subjected to
   different crop management schemes. Two vineyards had a herbaceous cover
   planted between crop rows to prevent soil erosion. In one vineyard these
   herbaceous cover corridors were chemically managed to prevent
   competition between the herb cover and the crop, whereas in a second the
   herbaceous cover was subject to mechanical management through some
   clearing, crop coverage, and height checks. A third vineyard was under
   conventional management (bare soil and soil tillage) and served as a
   control. We compared landscape structure and metrics, and passerine
   species richness, abundance, and diversity between the three vineyards.
   Results Overall bird species richness and diversity, as well as
   abundance of insectivorous passerine birds were highest in the
   mechanically managed vineyard. The chemically managed vineyard had lower
   species richness and abundance in comparison to the mechanically managed
   vineyard. In contrast, the conventionally managed plot had the lowest
   bird diversity, abundance, and species richness of all three plots.
   Landscape diversity was similar across the three vineyards. Conclusion
   Although our findings are preliminary and more research and replications
   are needed, we demonstrate that mechanically managed herbaceous cover
   corridors in vineyards, have positive impacts on the resident bird
   communities.},

Abstract = {We evaluated the richness, composition and abundance of bird communities
   in three urban forests of Mediterranean France during winter and spring.
   The urban forests differed in size, composition, structure, age of
   vegetation, and location relative to the city centre. Estimated species
   richness across all three urban forest parks was 45 species. Twenty six
   (26) species were recorded in both winter and spring, whereas ten
   species were recorded only in spring, and six were recorded only in
   winter. Distribution, turnover, and type of bird foraging guild were
   related to characteristics of each urban forest and season. During
   spring migration, more species were recorded in sampling units (250 x
   250 m) within the largest and most natural urban forest located in the
   outskirts of Montpellier, whereas during winter, more species were
   recorded in the most urbanized park (i.e., a botanical garden dominated
   by exotic vegetation), which was located in the city centre.
   Insectivorous birds were more abundant in winter, whereas seedeaters
   associated with wooded habitats were recorded more frequently in spring.
   Our results suggested that different kinds of urban forests are

   maintain the diversity of migratory and resident birds as well as

Abstract = {Estimating the relative importance of vegetation on residential land
   (gardens, yards, and street-trees) and vegetation on non-residential
   land (parks and other large green spaces) is important so that competing
   options for urban conservation planning can be prioritized. We used data
   from an urban breeding-bird monitoring program to compare the relative
   effects vegetation on residential land and vegetation on non-residential
   land (both the amount and type of vegetation at local and landscape
   scales) on bird species richness and an index of conservation value for
   the bird community. We then estimated the realised relative benefit of
   managing the amount of vegetation on these two types of land (i.e., as
   alternative management options for promoting biodiversity), which might
   be achieved within the practical limits imposed by human population
   density. The local effects of increasing residential and non-residential
   vegetation amount were similar and positive on all measures of bird
   species richness and conservation value. Non-residential vegetation had
   an additional landscape-scale influence on bird diversity that
   residential vegetation did not. Options for managing the amount of
   non-residential vegetation appear to be more limited by high human
   population density than for managing the amount of residential
   vegetation. This suggests that there may be greater realised benefits to
   bird diversity from managing the amount of vegetation on residential
   land than from the more common focus of urban planning of managing
   vegetation on non-residential land.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home and garden pesticide use has been linked to cancer and
   other health outcomes in numerous epidemiological studies. Exposure has
   generally been self-reported, so the assessment is potentially limited
   by recall bias and lack of information on specific chemicals.
   OBJECTIVES: As part of an integrated assessment of residential pesticide
   exposure, we identified active ingredients and described patterns of
   storage and use.
   METHODS: During a home interview of 500 residentially stable households
   enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study during
   2001-2006, trained interviewers inventoried residential pesticide
   products and queried participants about their storage and use. U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency registration numbers, recorded from
   pesticide product labels, and pesticide chemical codes were matched to
   public databases to obtain information on active ingredients and
   chemical class. Poisson regression was used to identify independent
   predictors of pesticide storage. Analyses were restricted to 259
   participating control households.
   RESULTS: Ninety-five percent (246 of 259) of the control households
   stored at least one pesticide product (median, 4). Indicators of higher
   sociodemographic status predicted more products in storage. We
   identified the most common characteristics: storage areas (garage, 40\%;
   kitchen, 20\%), pests treated (ants, 33\%; weeds, 20\%), pesticide types
   (insecticides, 46\%; herbicides, 24\%), chemical classes (pyrethroids,
   77\%; botanicals, 50\%), active ingredients (pyrethrins, 43\%) and
   synergists (piperonyl butoxide, 42\%). Products could contain multiple
   active ingredients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data on specific active ingredients and patterns of
   storage and use will inform future etiologic analyses of residential
   pesticide exposures from self-reported data, particularly among
   households with young children.},

Abstract = {Domestic gardens offer immense potential as sites for native
   biodiversity conservation. In urban areas they often comprise the
   largest land use, thus presenting an accessible and immediate way for
   urban dwellers to connect with nature and to support and enhance native
   biodiversity. This paper presents findings from a study of 55 domestic
   gardens undertaken in Dunedin, New Zealand, which explores householders'
   relationships with their gardens. The study data was derived from two
   interviews with householders, two photo exercises (approximately a year
   apart), together with a number of biological studies of the gardens.
   Gardens proved to be very important for our householders: for physical
   and mental health, as an expression of ownership and identity, as sites
   for social relationships, for connecting with nature and as site of
   domestic produce production. Householders' connections with nature were
   idiosyncratic, multifaceted and exhibited in ways that are more complex
   and varied than those usually considered by those working in the natural
   sciences and indeed biophilia supporters. We emphasize the importance of
   the people side of nature in seeking to build and support positive
   ecological change in the urban environment and the value of combining
   natural and social science approaches. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {When Does an Alien Become a Native Species? A Vulnerable Native Mammal
   Recognizes and Responds to Its Long-Term Alien Predator},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The impact of alien predators on native prey populations is often
   attributed to prey naivete `towards a novel threat. Yet evolutionary
   theory predicts that alien predators cannot remain eternally novel; prey
   species must either become extinct or learn and adapt to the new threat.
   As local enemies lose their naivete' and coexistence becomes possible,
   an introduced species must eventually become `native'. But when exactly
   does an alien become a native species? The dingo (Canis lupus dingo) was
   introduced to Australia about 4000 years ago, yet its native status
   remains disputed. To determine whether a vulnerable native mammal
   (Perameles nasuta) recognizes the close relative of the dingo, the
   domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), we surveyed local residents to
   determine levels of bandicoot visitation to yards with and without
   resident dogs. Bandicoots in this area regularly emerge from bushland to
   forage in residential yards at night, leaving behind tell-tale deep,
   conical diggings in lawns and garden beds. These diggings were less
   likely to appear at all, and appeared less frequently and in smaller
   quantities in yards with dogs than in yards with either resident cats
   (Felis catus) or no pets. Most dogs were kept indoors at night, meaning
   that bandicoots were not simply chased out of the yards or killed before
   they could leave diggings, but rather they recognized the threat posed
   by dogs and avoided those yards. Native Australian mammals have had
   thousands of years experience with wild dingoes, which are very closely
   related to domestic dogs. Our study suggests that these bandicoots may
   no longer be naive towards dogs. We argue that the logical criterion for
   determining native status of a long-term alien species must be once its
   native enemies are no longer naive.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is an extreme form of habitat modification, but retention
   of native vegetation in bushland reserves may improve the ecological
   sustainability of cities. We focused on bats (Microchiroptera) and
   investigated the use of the urban matrix and surrounding bushland in a
   region of Sydney, Australia, where remnant bushland persists and gardens
   often support large trees. Ultrasonic surveys were conducted at 40 sites
   over one summer season in the backyard matrix, bushland remnants and
   surrounding National Parks to determine which species were present, and
   the influence of landscape elements and habitat characteristics on
   activity, species richness and presence of individual species. In total,
   15 of the 17 microbat species known from the Sydney region were recorded
   in the study area. Yet only three of these species, Chalinolobus
   gouldii, Mormopterus species 2 and Miniopterus schreibersii were present
   in more than 40\% of sites. Bat activity was significantly higher in
   remnant bushland on shale soils and in backyards, compared with
   sandstone gully and ridge remnants, or reference sites in nearby
   National Parks. Furthermore, species assemblages in urban areas were
   different from assemblages in reference sites. Of all the habitat
   characteristics examined, the amount of bushland within 0.5-3 km
   surrounding a site and tree density were the most common predictors of
   individual species presence, particularly rare species. Area of
   bushland, hollow abundance and average tree diameter were positively
   correlated with species richness, while tree diameter was the strongest
   predictor of total microbat activity. The proximity of large areas of
   bushland and the many trees remaining in residential areas of the
   northern `leafy' suburbs of Sydney allowed the persistence of a range of
   bat species. The higher bat activity on fertile shale soils indicated
   that bushland remnants embedded within cities can have high conservation
   value for bats. Surveys in more urbanized areas of Sydney are needed to
   test predictions of the models derived in this study.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {144},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2151-2162},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Birds in woodland can be affected by increasing deer populations through
   changes to vegetation structure and potential impacts on foraging
   resources; these effects need to be better understood. Effects of deer
   browsing are reported from a replicated split-plot exclusion experiment
   in English coppiced woodland. All stages of growth were examined up to
   eight years after felling. We used standardised mist-netting (totaling
   1920 h) to sample birds in breeding and post-breeding periods. Deer
   browsing strongly altered vegetation structure by reducing canopy cover
   and shrub layer foliage density. However deer did not affect
   invertebrate density per unit of foliage, providing no evidence of an
   ungulate-mediated plant chemical response affecting forage quality for
   invertebrate herbivores. At avian guild level, significantly more ground
   and understorey foraging birds were captured where deer were excluded,
   and negative responses to browsing were more marked for pooled migrants
   than pooled residents. At the species level, especially pronounced
   negative effects were evident for dunnock (Prunella modularis) and
   garden warbler (Sylvia borin); approximately five times more dunnocks
   were captured in deer exclosures than in browsed vegetation. We also
   detected negative responses to browsing by nightingale (Luscinia
   megarhynchos) and long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus). No significant
   positive responses to browsing were detected. For some species the use
   of young re-growth increased post breeding relative to the breeding
   period, including a marked shift by pooled residents that involved a
   disproportionate number of juveniles. Previous studies in North America
   have shown that, through vegetation modification, ungulate activity can
   alter woodland bird assemblages; as far as we are aware this is the
   first experimental demonstration of effects in Europe, and at low to
   moderate browsing intensity typical of the wider landscape scale. (C)

Abstract = {BioLure, a synthetic food attractant for Mediterranean fruit fly
   {[}Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann)], is composed of three chemicals
   (ammonium acetate, trimethylamine hydrochloride, and putrescine). We
   deployed these components together and in separate MultiLure traps
   across predominantly native forests, non-native forests, farmlands,
   orchards, and residential areas on the islands of Hawaii and Maui, to
   evaluate attraction of C. capitata and nontarget insects. Large numbers
   (as many as 186 per trap per day) of mainly saprophagous nontarget flies
   (primarily Drosophilidae, Chloropidae, Lonchaeidae, Neriidae, Otitidae,
   and Calliphoridae) were attracted to BioLure. Very few predators,
   parasitoids, or pollinators were attracted. Native species,
   predominantly drosophilid and calliphorid flies, were attracted in large
   numbers in endemic forests, but mostly (at least 88\%) introduced
   species were collected in orchards, backyards, and non-native forest. A
   comparison of attraction to the three separate components versus
   combined components in traps revealed that ammonium acetate and, to a
   lesser extent, putrescine are the key components attractive to nontarget
   species. Omitting the putrescine ingredient from BioLure did not
   drastically decrease C. capitata catches but reduced nontarget captures
   by 20\%.},

Abstract = {Three natural enemies naturally present in southern California avocado
   groves were evaluated against different stages of the avocado lace bug,

   promising natural enemy from laboratory and subsequent greenhouse
   evaluations was C. rufilabris. In addition to natural enemies,
   insecticides were evaluated for P. perseae control. The contact impact
   of less persistent materials on nymphs in the laboratory was assessed.
   The most effective insecticides based on residual impact studies were
   carbaryl, imidacloprid, and fenpropathrin, and 2 materials commonly used
   on avocados in California, abamectin and spinosad, which were
   ineffective. Among the insecticides evaluated based on contact activity,

Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Few urban studies of avian diversity discriminate between native and
   exotic species, although highly modified urban environments typically
   support significant numbers of non-native species. High overall
   diversity may mask poor native diversity. We identify which native
   species are successful in a variety of urban habitats in a New Zealand
   city, and examine the roles that garden size and complexity, native
   fragments, and vegetation composition and cover play in explaining
   variations in native and exotic avian diversity. Nearly half(44\%) of 39
   species recorded were exotic: four(three exotic and one native)
   comprised 45\% of birds counted. While there was little variation
   between habitats in combined native and exotic species richness, the
   number and abundance of bush-dependent natives differed. Similarity
   measures identified three groups: (1) commercial, industrial and
   residential areas with small structurally simple gardens where 3-4
   exotic species were numerically dominant and few bush natives made up
   <10\% of the total count; (2) Suburbs with medium/large gardens
   dominated by lawns. shrubs and trees, with many exotic species but also
   several bush natives (comprising 24-32\% of the total count); and (3)
   bush fragments where both diversity and species richness of bush natives
   were highest (comprising 50-75\% of the total count), including four
   insectivores absent from all residential areas. Vegetation structure,
   composition and cover, and proximity to fragments did not explain much
   of the variation in total or native species richness and diversity, but
   did explain 69\% and 72\% of bush-native species richness and abundance
   respectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Supplementary food given to birds can have contemporary effects by
   reducing the risk starvation, increasing survival and altering movements
   and reproductive performance. There is, however, a widely held
   perception that birds benefit from extra food over winter, but that it
   is better that they `look after themselves' during breeding. Here we
   describe a landscape-scale experiment showing for the first time that
   the effects of increasing food availability only during the winter can
   be carried over to the subsequent breeding season. Even though food
   supplementation stopped six weeks prior to breeding, birds living on
   sites provisioned over winter had advanced laying dates and increased
   fledging success compared with birds living on unprovisioned sites.
   Thus, supplemental feeding of wild birds during winter, in a manner
   mimicking householders provisioning in gardens and backyards, has the
   potential to alter bird population dynamics by altering future
   reproductive performance. With levels of bird feeding by the public
   continuing to increase, the impacts of this additional food supply on
   wild bird populations may be considerable.},

Abstract = {From September 1995 to February 2001, blood samples were collected from
   865 neotropical felids belonging to 8 different species. These animals
   were housed in 86 institutions located in 78 cities of 20 Brazilian
   states. Our goal was to identify the risk factors associated with
   sero-positivity to Toxoplasma gondii in captive neotropical felids from
   Brazil. All serum samples were tested by the modified agglutination test
   (MAT), using formalin-fixed whole tachyzoites and mercaptoethanol. For
   each animal an individual questionnaire was filled with questions about
   tattoo number, felid species, age, sex, origin, number of animals in the
   group, introduction of new animals in the group, time in the
   institution, eating meat previously frozen for a period < 7 days in the
   last 6 months, eating meat of run-over or euthanized animals in the last
   6 months, predation of rodents or birds in the last 6 months and
   presence of domestic cats near the enclosures in the last 6 months. The
   total sero-prevalence was 55\% (95\% CI: 52\%, 57\%). We estimated a
   prevalence of 46\% (95\% CI: 40\%, 54\%) for jaguarundi (Puma
   yagouaroundi); 58\% (95\% Cl: 53\%, 63\%) for ocelot (Leopardus
   pardalis); 50\% (95\% CI: 45\%,56\%) for oncilla(L. tigrinus); 54\%
   (95\%CI: 46\%,62\%)for margay(L. wiedii); 12\% (95\%CI: 4\%,31\%) for
   Pampas-cat (L. colocolo); 83\% (95\% Cl: 65\%, 93\%) for Geoffroy's-cat
   (L. geoffroyi); 64\% (95\% Cl: 50\% 68\%) for jaguar (Panthera onca) and
   48\% (95\% Cl: 42\%,54\%) for puma (Puma concolor). Multiple logistic
   regression was used to evaluate the association between the variables in
   the questionnaire and sero-positivity to T gondii. We concluded that the
   independent risk factors for toxoplasmosis were: age > 3 years (OR =
   4.75 {[}2.75; 8.2]), eating meat previously frozen for a period < 7 days
   (OR = 2.23 {[}1.24 4.01]). and consumption of animals that were run-over

Abstract = {Despite an academic shift from dualistic to hybrid frameworks of
   culture/nature relations, separationist paradigms of environmental
   management have great resilience and vernacular appeal. The conditions
   under which they are reinforced, maintained or ruptured need more
   detailed attention because of the urgent environmental challenges of a
   humanly transformed earth. We draw on research in 265 Australian
   backyard gardens, focusing on two themes where conceptual and material
   bounding practices intertwine; spatial boundary-making and native
   plants. We trace the resilience of separationist approaches in the
   Australian context to the overlay of indigeneity/ non-indigeneity atop
   other dualisms, and their rupture to situations of close everyday
   engagement between people, plants, water and birds. Our ethnographic
   methods show that gardens are places where both attitudes and practices
   can change in the process of such engagements. In a world where
   questions of sustainability are increasingly driven by cities and their
   residents, these chains of agency help identify areas of hope and
   transformative potential as well as concern.},

Abstract = {Pyrethroid pesticides have replaced organophosphates for many urban
   applications, including structural pest control, landscape maintenance,
   and residential home and garden use. This study was intended to
   determine if pyrethroids are detectable and widespread in diverse urban
   systems and if concentrations are high enough to cause associated
   aquatic toxicity. Urban creeks in California and Tennessee were tested
   on up to four occasions for pesticide residues in sediments, and aquatic
   toxicity was determined by acute toxicity tests using the amphipod,
   Hyalella azteca. In California, 12 of the 15 creeks tested were toxic on
   at least one sampling occasion, and sediment pyrethroid concentrations
   were sufficient to explain the observed toxicity in most cases. The
   pyrethroid bifenthrin, due to its high concentrations and relative
   toxicity as compared to other pyrethroids, was likely responsible for
   the majority of the toxicity at most sites. Cypermethrin, cyfluthrin,
   deltamethrin, and A-cyhalothrin also contributed to toxicity at some
   locations. The source of cypermethrin and deltamethrin was probably
   almost entirely structural pest control by professional applicators.
   Bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, and A-cyhalothrin may have originated either
   from professional structural pest control or from lawn and garden care
   by homeowners. None of the sediments collected from the 12 Tennessee
   creeks were toxic, and pyrethroids were rarely detectable. Regional
   differences between Tennessee and California are possibly attributable
   to climate, differences in types of residential development, and
   pesticide use practices.},

Abstract = {Capsule Suburban House Sparrows prefer gardens with native bushes but
   show no detectable response to garden insecticide use.
   Aims To identify the factors that influence House Sparrow distribution
   among suburban gardens.
   Methods Bicycle transects were used to survey House Sparrows in front
   gardens in suburban Oxford in the spring of 2004. A subset of 498
   gardens was selected comprising all those where sparrows were found and
   an equal number of randomly selected sparrow-free gardens. In each of
   these gardens the density of bushes and the proportion of native bushes
   were recorded and insecticide use and house age were sampled by
   questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was used to compare these
   variables with the presence or absence of House Sparrows. A larger scale
   analysis was also conducted comparing 25 squares, each 250 m(2). The
   density of House Sparrows in the total area of front gardens in these
   squares was compared to the area of green space within the square, its
   distance from the city edge and encounter rates of corvids on the cycle
   transects.
   Results House Sparrows show a preference for gardens with native bushes.
   They also prefer gardens with a higher overall density of bushes but
   appear to make no distinction based on insecticide use or house age.
   There is no evidence that green space, distance from the city edge or
   density of corvids affect sparrow numbers of a larger spatial scale.
   Conclusion House Sparrows might benefit from planting of native bushes
   but not apparently from a reduction in garden insecticide use. The
   preference for native vegetation most likely reflects the associated
   abundance of insect food, which is required by the growing chicks.
   Further investigation of the habits of House Sparrows in the breeding
   season may shed light on the causes of the recent decline of the
   species.},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {A large database collated by bird watchers was analysed to determine
   whether birds living in the urban habitats of Sydney, Australia could be
   characterised as a discrete community differing from those occupying a
   variety of nearby native habitats. Standardised surveys at fixed
   distances from nine remnants of one native habitat (woodland/scrub on
   Hawkesbury sandstone) were then conducted to determine whether size of,
   and distance to, remnants of native habitat influenced the composition
   of the surrounding suburban bird community. Non-metric multidimensional
   scaling did not separate the bird community of urban parks and gardens
   from those occupying residential areas. However, analysis of similarity
   showed that these communities were significantly different from the bird
   communities of each of the native habitats. Suburban habitats could be
   differentiated by the prevalence of exotic species as well as parrots,
   large honeyeaters, and large birds incorporating vertebrate foods in
   their diet, and a relative rarity of small insectivores and honeyeaters.
   Nearby remnant vegetation had little effect on the bird community
   inhabiting suburban areas. No significant effects of remnant size or
   remnant proximity were detected for species richness, individual
   abundance or community composition. These results suggest that there is
   little overlap in use of urban and remnant habitats by the majority of
   species and that in order to increase bird diversity, urban habitats
   must provide a fuller complement of ecological requirements. (C) 2003

Abstract = {In this study we assessed organophosphorus (OP) pesticide exposure among
   children living in two Seattle metropolitan area communities by
   measuring urinary metabolites, and identified possible exposure risk
   factors through a parental interview. We recruited children in clinic
   acid outpatient waiting rooms. We obtained spot urine samples in the
   spring and fall of 1998 from 110 children ages 2-5 years, from 96
   households. We analyzed urine samples for six dialkylphosphate (DAP)
   compounds, the common metabolites of the OP pesticides. Through parental
   interviews we gathered demographic and residential pesticide use data.
   At least one of the DAP metabolites was measured in 99\% of the
   children, and the two predominant metabolites (DMTP and DETP) were
   measured in 70-75\% of the children. We found no significant differences
   in DAP concentrations related to season, community, sex, age, family
   income, or housing type. Median concentrations of dimethyl and diethyl
   DAPs were 0.11 and 0.04 mu mol/L, respectively (all children).
   Concentrations were significantly higher in children whose parents
   reported pesticide use in the garden (0.19 vs. 0.09 mu mol/L For
   dimethyl metabolites, p = 0.05; 0.04 vs. 0.03 mu mol/L for diethyl
   metabolites, p = 0.02), but were not different based on reported pet
   treatment or indoor residential use. Nearly all children in this study
   had measurable levels of OP pesticide metabolites. Some of this exposure
   was likely due to diet. Garden pesticide use was associated with
   elevated metabolite levels. It is unlikely that these exposure levels
   would cause acute intoxication, but the longterm health effects of such
   exposures are unknown. We recommend that OP pesticide use be avoided in
   areas where children are likely to play.},

Abstract = {Abundance and habitat relationships of butterfly communities were
   examined at 15 sites divided into three different types of residential
   areas (n = 5 sites/type) in central Pennsylvania from May-September
   1997. Seventeen species were noted at the 15 sites, with the two most
   abundant being non-native, cabbage whites (Pieris rapae, 69.2\% of
   total) and orange sulfurs (Colias eutytheme, 10.0\%). The most abundant
   native species was the monarch (Danaus plexippus, 7.5\%). More butterfly
   species (n = 13 species) but a lower than expected number of individual
   butterflies of all species combined (P < 0.05) occurred in residential
   areas with established (homes > 30 years old) and native overstory trees
   than in the two other types of residential areas. Total species richness
   of butterflies was positively correlated with the number of homes per
   site (i.e., smaller lot size) (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the total
   number of butterflies of all species combined and the total number of
   cabbage whites were negatively correlated with the number of yards
   containing native overstory trees (P < 0.05). Compared to forested or
   agricultural landscapes in central Pennsylvania, the diversity and
   abundance of butterflies were relatively low in residential areas. In
   residential landscapes, however, a diverse butterfly community was
   characteristic of older, established neighborhoods characterized by
   smaller lot size and native overstory tree species. The planting of
   gardens containing both nectar sources and hostplants for butterflies
   will likely enhance their diversity and abundance in residential areas.},

   obtained urine samples taken in the children's schools, and each sample
   was accompanied by a questionnaire about lifestyle and dietary habits.
   We found DMP and DMTP in detectable concentrations in the greatest

Abstract = {Previous studies have suggested an association between exposure to
   pesticides and different types of childhood cancer. This paper presents
   results from a population-based case-control interview study of parents
   of children less than 15 years of age, which was conducted in the states
   of West Germany from 1993 to 1997. Cases were 1,184 children with
   leukemia, 234 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 940 with a solid tumor;
   2,588 controls were also included. Parental occupational exposures were
   found to be related to childhood cancer regardless of the time period of
   exposure and the type of cancer. This finding might partially be
   explained by different recall of past exposures by the parents of cases
   and controls. Residential use of insecticides was associated with
   childhood lymphoma: both extermination of insects by professional pest
   controllers (odds ratio (OR) = 2.6, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.2,
   5.7) and frequency of parental use of household insecticides (p for
   trend = 0.02) were significant risk factors for this diagnosis. The use
   of pesticides on farms was weakly related to childhood leukemia (OR =
   1.5, 95\% CI: 1.0, 2.2), while their use in gardens was not associated
   with childhood leukemia (OR = 1.0, 95\% CI: 0.8, 1.2). The major
   strengths of this study were the population base and the large number of
   cases and controls included; a drawback was assessment of exposure on
   the basis of parental interviews. The data provide some evidence for an
   increased leukemia risk for children living on farms and for an
   association between use of household pesticides and risk of childhood
   leukemia or lymphoma.},

Abstract = {This study was undertaken between May and December 1994 to investigate
   the prevalence of hematophagous mites in Sweden. A particular aim was to
   establish the relationship between occurrence of mites and certain types
   of production systems for egg layers. Initially a postal questionnaire
   study was performed. Some months later this was followed up by
   inspections, sampling, and interviews on farms. The only mite species
   found was the red poultry mite, Dermanyssus gallinae. Although this
   species was found to be present in cage batteries, deep-litter systems,
   and backyard flocks, it was less prevalent among birds housed in cages.
   About 4\% of the cage systems were found to be affected both according
   to the results of the postal inquiry and from the field study. However,
   discrepancies in prevalence were found when comparing the results
   obtained with these two investigations regarding alternative,
   deep-litter systems and backyard flocks. According to the inquiry, 21\%
   of the deep-litter flocks were afflicted whereas 33\% were found to be
   afflicted in the field investigation. Among the backyard flocks, 19\%
   were afflicted whereas as many as 67\% of the flocks were found to be
   afflicted upon inspection. These discrepancies were probably due to the
   fact that the situation had actually changed in some farms during the
   study period, but possibly also to inherent methodological errors.
   Farmers were also interviewed with focus on methods of husbandry and
   control strategies. Most farmers answered that they were combatting the
   mites by cleaning the empty houses and using chemicals such as
   organophosphorous compounds, carbamates, and synthetic pyrethroids. In
   several instances the problems were still not solved despite these
   curative or preventive measures. A control program for D. gallinae is
   suggested by regular screening and certification of the ectoparasite
   status of the birds before their transfer to production sites.},

   environments have become more abundant, whereas those flourishing in
   woodlands have diminished. There is no simple relationship between
   changing resource availability and shifting patterns of consumption and
   sale of gathered produce: socioeconomic changes and changing preferences
   are important influences on consumption, whereas the emergence of
   markets for gathered resources is related to processes of specialization
   and exchange rather than physical scarcity. There has been an overall
   decrease in the diversity of gathered produce eaten, with increased
   dependence on `weeds' and `pests' gathered from privately used land
   (homeyards, gardens and fields). At the same time, agricultural
   production has become more dependent on fertility inputs from common
   property woodland. Poorer households are more dependent on consumption,
   sale and other use of woodland and other gathered produce than are
   wealthy households.},

Abstract = {The relationship between family pesticide use and childhood brain cancer
   was examined in a case-control study. Telephone interviews were
   conducted from June 1989 through March 1990 with the natural mothers of
   45 childhood brain cancer cases, 85 friend controls, and 108 cancer
   controls. In comparisons to friend controls, significant positive
   associations were observed for use of pesticides to control nuisance
   pests in the home, no-pest-strips in the home, pesticides to control
   termites, Kwell(R) shampoo, flea collars on pets, diazinon in the garden
   or orchard, and herbicides to control weeds in the yard. In comparisons
   to cancer controls, significant positive associations were observed for
   use of pesticide bombs in the home, pesticides to control termites, flea
   collars on pets, insecticides in the garden or orchard, carbaryl in the
   garden or orchard, and herbicides to control weeds in the yard. In
   general, positive associations in comparisons to one control group were
   supported by elevated odds ratios in comparisons to the other control
   group. Several potentially important associations were identified in
   this study. However, small sample sizes, potential recall bias, multiple
   comparisons, and lack of detailed exposure verification require further
   research to confirm these findings.},

Abstract = {This study examined family use of pesticides in the home, garden,
   orchard, and yard. Data were collected from 238 families in Missouri
   during telephone interviews from June 1989 to March 1990.
   Nearly all families (97.8\%) used pesticides at least one time per year
   and two thirds used pesticides more than five times per year. More than
   80\% used pesticides during pregnancy and 70\% used pesticides during
   the first 6 months of a child's life.
   The most common setting for family pesticide use was in the home, where
   80\% of families used pesticides at least once per year. This was
   followed by herbicide use to control yard weeds (57\% of families) and
   insecticide use to control fleas and ticks on pets (50\% of families). A
   substantial number of families also used pesticides in the garden or
   orchard (33\%).
   Flea collars were the most popular pest control product (50\% of
   families). Carbaryl or Sevin(R) was also popular, with 28.2\% of
   families reporting use. No-pest-strips (dichlorvos) and Kwelle shampoo
   (lindane) were used by almost 10\% of participating families.
   Examination of study data revealed that families limited exposure to
   pesticides for the mother during pregnancy and for children during the
   first 6 months of life. Families failed to recognize and reduce
   pervasive exposures associated with no-pest-strips and flea collars.},

Journal = {IBIS},

Volume = {119},
Number = {3},
Pages = {291-308},
Abstract = {Nectar-feeding of birds was recorded during a phenological study of the
   woody vegetation at Zaria in the Northern Guinea Savanna of Nigeria.
   Throughout the dry season when it is in a non-breeding state, the
   scarlet-breasted sunbird Nectarinia senegalensis concentrated on the
   ornithophilous plants which flower in an overlapping sequence, and
   exploited the smaller-flowered species less frequently. As the flowering
   of the ornithophilous species decreased at the end of the dry season,
   the range of other plants exploited increased but, in the early rains as
   the flowering of the indigenous plants tailed off, the sunbird switched
   to ornamental exotics and the indigenous, shrubby parasite, Tapinanthus
   globiferus. The bird was more conspicuously insectivorous during the wet
   season when it bred. The pygmy sunbird Anthreptes platura is a breeding,
   dry season visitor which exploits a somewhat different range of
   small-flowered, mainly entomophilous species and some exotics but also
   takes nectar from those ornithophilous species it can exploit, as well
   as the chiropterophilous Parkia clappertoniana. The bulk of the breeding
   population left the district before the flowering of the indigenous
   plant tailed off. The 5 other species of sunbird recorded in the
   district were either very rare residents or more numerous wet-season
   visitors and passage migrants for which records of nectar-feeding are
   too few to draw conclusions about seasonal changes but the wet-season
   visitors appeared to rely on the garden exotics in the comparative
   absence of flowering indigenous plants. Nectar-feeding on Bombax
   castatum and P. clappertoniana, where nectar is readily accessible and
   present in relatively large quantities, was noted for 15 spp. of
   non-nectariniid birds, some of which were regular visitors. Some
   examples of flower consumption probably related to nectar-feeding are
   also mentioned.},

Abstract = {During the autumns of 1971-1973, 35 Blyth''s red warblers were
   mist-netted in thorn scrub on the outskirts of New Delhi {[}India] where
   the species occurs as a passage migrant between Aug.-Nov. and in
   March-May. All birds were weighed, measured and the state of molt
   recorded using Newton''s (1966) system. Primary molt duration, about 8-9
   wk, was similar to that recorded for a variety of resident small
   passerines molting at the same season. The wren warblers Prinia spp. and
   the yellow-eyed babbler Chrysomma sinensis take about 8 wks; the Indian
   robin Saxicoloides fulicata, about 9 wks. This is also similar to the
   rates given for temperate passerines, but much more rapid than those for
   species resident in the equable tropics. Blyth''s reed warblers molt but
   do not winter in the Delhi area, indicating that these birds utilize
   separate molting and wintering areas. A progressive increase in weight
   during the molting period showed that the molting area provided
   sufficient food for Blyth''s reed warblers to build up fat stores before
   continuing the migration. On the return passage through the area in
   spring, the species avoided the scrub habitat, which was very parched by
   this time, and concentrated instead in moist riverine habitats and
   gardens. The spring flush of insects, which occurred in moist areas as
   the temperature rose, probably enabled the migrants to build up
   sufficient fat reserves to undertake the return migration to their
   breeding grounds.},

Abstract = {Inadequacies in public protected area networks dictates that private

   that can serve as refuges for biodiversity, with birds as a popular
   flagship for garden biodiversity. Discussion has focused heavily on the
   species of plant a resident might select to attract birds to their
   garden. In this paper, we describe additional and important factors that
   should form part of this broader conversation on gardens for birds and
   biodiversity, with a specific aim of drawing attention to species that
   are at risk of localised extinctions in modern urban landscapes - urban
   adaptors. We present our commentary in two themes: (a) mitigating
   threats to birds in the urban environment and (b) enhancing the habitat
   value of the urban environment for a broader range of bird species. We
   provide a synthesis of the research of recent years that has explored
   the urban environment and its ability to support birds, but importantly,
   we extend on this by bringing together topics that have been somewhat
   lacking in the discussion to date. In a new approach to this
   conversation, this paper brings together key topics that can no longer
   be considered in isolation if we are to make significant conservation

Abstract = {Simple Summary A non-native species, the Oriental Magpie (Pica serica)
   has established a population in a restricted area of southern Hokkaido,
   northern Japan, since the 1990s. To clarify the current number and
   distribution of the population and their major determinants, we
   conducted intensive field surveys six times during the course of a year
   from May 2012 in Tomakomai City, the central area of the current
   distribution. We found 181 to 248 magpies in every survey, and 46 active
   nests in May. Most of the magpies appeared in residential areas,
   avoiding commercial and industrial areas. The magpies foraged mainly in
   short grasslands in public spaces, such as parks, in May and July, and
   most of the birds preferred house gardens for foraging from November to
   March. Dogs or cats were often kept outside in the gardens where the
   magpies foraged, and observations of the magpies stealing pet food were
   common. It is likely that the magpies rely on anthropogenic food
   resources such as pet food, especially in winter. This study provides a
   basis for further monitoring of this non-native magpie species that has
   invaded urban/suburban habitats in Hokkaido, Japan. As magpies and their
   nests are easy to find, citizen science could contribute to such
   monitoring.Abstract Non-native species have caused various problems for
   both animal and human communities globally, but their monitoring during
   the early stages of establishment is often difficult. A population of
   the Oriental Magpie (Pica serica) has established on Hokkaido Island,
   northern Japan, since the 1990s, offering a rare opportunity for field
   biologists to monitor the entire history of a colonizing avian
   population. To clarify the current number and distribution of the
   population and their major determinants, we conducted bimonthly surveys
   from May 2012 to March 2013, over a total of 417 h, in Tomakomai City,
   the central area of the current distribution. We found 181 to 248
   magpies in every survey, and 46 active nests in May. Most of the magpies
   appeared in residential areas, avoiding commercial and industrial areas,
   and did not show seasonal changes in their distribution pattern. The
   magpies mainly foraged in short grasslands in public spaces, such as
   parks, in May and July, but most of the birds preferred house gardens
   for foraging from November to March. Dogs or cats were often kept
   outside in the gardens where the magpies foraged, and observations of
   magpies stealing and hoarding pet food were common. It is likely that
   the magpies rely on anthropogenic food resources such as pet food,
   especially in winter. Continuous monitoring of this population will
   enable further knowledge of the factors that limit the number and range
   of not only non-native species but also avian populations in general to
   be obtained.},

Abstract = {BackgroundNeonicotinoid pesticides ('neonics') - imidacloprid,
   thiamethoxam, clothianidin, acetamiprid, dinotefuran-are the most widely
   used class of insecticides in the world. They have a neurotoxic
   mechanism of action, similar to nicotine. They are detected in food,
   waterways, tap water, and breast milk.MethodsWe make use of the
   non-occupational human pesticide poisoning reports in the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) online Incident Data System (IDS).
   The data set contains individual incidents, and incidents aggregated and
   submitted in bulk to EPA. IDS reports are predominantly self-reported
   information of varying and often low level of detail and are not
   routinely validated or verified by EPA.ResultsWe reviewed 842
   non-occupational human poisoning incidents associated with neonics in
   the IDS from 2018 through 2022. There are four human fatality reports,
   two associated with clothianidin and two with acetamiprid. Major
   illnesses such as seizures were reported in several cases, including
   with dinotefuran cockroach bait product, and an imidacloprid lawn
   product. Moderate poisonings make up 88\% of the total poisonings (740
   of 842), with most of those associated with imidacloprid (547 incidents)
   or dinotefuran (102 incidents). Common reported symptoms classified as
   moderate often included two or more of the following: headaches;
   dizziness; lethargy; eye or throat irritation; skin itching and rash;
   chemical burns and skin peeling; face swelling; muscle weakness or
   tremors; vomiting; diarrhea; pain and tightness in chest; open sores;
   and general pain. These incidents stem mainly from residential uses,
   such as lawn and garden insect repellents, home pest treatments for bed
   bugs or roaches, and products used to treat pets for fleas and
   ticks.ConclusionGiven the evidence of neurotoxicity, EPA should use its
   legal authority to cancel unsafe products and unnecessary uses -
   including from seed treatments, and residential pet and lawncare
   products - to prevent further human suffering.},

   Chickens},
Journal = {ANTHROZOOS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {299-310},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {A recent resurgence in keeping backyard chickens has been attributed to
   increasing awareness of and nostalgia for the ``natural{''} and
   consumers' desire to know more about where their food comes from,
   alongside food shortages experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   However, limited empirical research has explored why people are
   motivated to keep chickens in their backyard. This paper analyses
   qualitative interviews undertaken in Australia to explore what motivated
   people to keep backyard chickens and their experiences. Thematic
   analysis of interviews involving 44 participants showed that backyard
   chickens had considerable utility value by providing eggs for food (but
   interestingly not meat), recycling food scraps, and educating children
   about where food comes from and how to care for animals. Participants
   also described chickens as having pet-like characteristics, with many
   articulating considerable details about the personalities of their birds
   and how they provide companionship. However, chickens are not afforded
   the same privileges as other domestic pets such as cats and dogs: for
   instance, participants stated that they would not seek veterinary advice
   should their chickens have symptoms of illness, nor do they allow them
   to come inside the home. We argue that chickens assume a liminal place
   on the human-animal relations spectrum, where they occupy a position
   that is simultaneously in both the affect and the utility categories.
   With the continued growth in backyard chickens, which are associated
   with concerns about the food supply due to the COVID-19 pandemic and
   related issues, together with increasing concerns about biosecurity,
   developing a more robust account of the complex roles they play and the
   relationships we have with them are critical for our understandings of
   ethical and related food choices in urban settings and the efficacy of
   possible policy interventions related to food supply.},

Title = {Learning and social influence on bird migration},
Journal = {ARDEA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {112},
Number = {2},
Pages = {171-199},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Several aspects of the migratory behaviour of birds, notably timing,
   direction and duration, have been shown, mainly from breeding
   experiments, to be under genetic influence. Nevertheless, aspects of
   migratory behaviour can be improved by learning, either from personal
   experience or from other individuals. This review is concerned with
   social influence on different aspects of bird migration. Communal
   migration can provide not only the usual anti-predation and food-finding
   benefits, but also energy savings (resulting from particular flock
   structures), greater synchronization of individual journeys and improved
   route finding. Individuals in a group can pool their knowledge of
   directions and routes to mutual benefit, and if a group contains
   different age-groups, na \& iuml;ve youngsters can learn from more
   experienced individuals. These advantages may be one reason why many
   birds migrate in flocks or in more diffuse aggregations, even some
   species that normally live solitarily. Some species, notably swans,
   geese and cranes, migrate as family units within flocks, so young could
   learn migratory routes, stopover sites and wintering areas from their
   parents. And providing the two age-groups migrated together, the young
   of other species could learn the same details from older, more
   experienced individuals, whether related or not. In the daytime, some
   birds can be seen to migrate on their own, while others travel in
   groups, flocks or other looser assemblages. Night migration has been
   studied by radar, ceilometers and other artificial lights and by
   `moon-watching', as well as by sound recording to detect flight calls.
   While some species travel at night in dense flocks, as in the daytime,
   others (including some solitary species) seem to travel in loose
   aggregations which may form once the birds are airborne. Calling
   maintains contact between individuals and may thereby provide
   information on optimal directions, flight altitudes and other aspects.
   Species vary in the extent to which they call at night, but such
   vocalizations increase at times of change, such as take-offs and
   landings, altitude changes or as birds enter mist. Many birds show
   specific behaviours before migration which serve to synchronize
   departures of those individuals which have reached an appropriate
   condition. Individual homing pigeons, released at a distance, can
   normally find their way back to their home loft, but different pigeons
   may develop different routes. When pairs of pigeons, which have
   developed different routes, are released together, they may either take
   an intermediate route or one pigeon may join the other regarded as
   `leader'. The larger the difference in experience between two pigeons,
   the greater the likelihood that the more experienced bird will emerge as
   leader. Migration in flocks may improve the accuracy of orientation if
   the direction of the flock is an average of the headings of the
   individual flock members (the `many wrongs' principle). This notion has
   been supported by experiments on homing pigeons, and also by
   observations of wild birds, in which single individuals or small groups
   showed more variation in their directions than did larger groups. In
   general, directional scatter decreased as group size increased. In such
   systems, individual birds benefit from social contact with others, but
   all individuals have equal influence on the resulting direction.
   In practice, some birds (leaders) are likely to have more influence on
   directions than others (experienced more than inexperienced), as shown
   in experiments with pigeons and tracking of wild goose families on
   migration. Large scale field experiments have also shown that birds can
   be influenced in their movements by others of their species, and that
   even birds from resident populations can sometimes be induced to migrate
   when released into areas where migrants prevail. When juveniles are
   released in the absence of experienced adults, they take a wider range
   of directions than normal, some of which take them off an optimal route.
   By training geese, swans or cranes to fly behind ultralight aircraft,
   new migration routes have been created, re-establishing migratory
   populations in areas from which they were eliminated in the past. Such
   experiments further illustrate the role of social influence on bird
   migratory patterns. Suggestions are made for further research aimed to
   fill gaps in understanding and to take forward our understanding of
   social influence on migratory behaviour.},

Abstract = {AimThe enemy release hypothesis states that the invasion success of
   non-native species is partly due to their escape from natural enemies,
   e.g., herbivores. Large-scale studies of herbivory using multiple
   species across multiple sites are needed to test the generality of
   herbivory release in non-native plants.LocationEurope.MethodsWe carried
   out leaf-herbivory surveys from 2007 to 2021 in 15 botanical gardens
   ranging in latitude from 47 degrees N (Switzerland) to 63 degrees N
   (Norway) to investigate how herbivory levels differed between (i) native
   and non-native species, and (ii) native and non-naturalised or
   naturalised species.ResultsOverall, we found that herbivory levels were
   lower on non-native than native species. In addition, we found that
   non-naturalised plants suffered less herbivory than natives and that
   naturalised plants showed similar levels of herbivory to native
   plants.Main ConclusionsWe find broad support for lower herbivory of
   non-native plant species compared to natives. However, the stronger
   reduction in herbivory for non-naturalised plants suggests that
   herbivore release may be transient and less pronounced for naturalised
   non-native species that have become abundant and integrated into
   resident communities. This has implications for the management of
   naturalised non-native plants, which are performing well in their
   non-native ranges despite suffering comparable herbivory levels to
   native species.},

Title = {Landscape and local factors drive pesticide distribution in perennial

Abstract = {Pesticides constitute a major threat to biodiversity, but our
   understanding of the complex interactions between local and landscape
   factors influencing their distribution in agroecosystems remains
   limited. We conducted a pioneering study where we screened spiders,
   rodents, plants and soils for multiple pesticide residues in perennial
   crops (orchards and vineyards) managed under organic (N = 8) and
   integrated pest management (N = 8) systems. We then quantified the
   proportional representation of major habitat types in surrounding
   landscapes. Additionally, we conducted interviews with farmers to gain
   precise insights into pesticide applications. We expected that landscape
   factors would be more important for mobile entities (i.e. spiders and
   rodents), while management type would be relatively more important for
   the sedentary entities (i.e. soils and plants). We detected various
   pesticides within studied crop types, including several forbidden in the
   European Union. We found that pesticide distribution in spiders was
   influenced by the proportion of semi-natural habitats in the landscape,
   with pesticide concentration decreasing as the proportion of
   semi-natural habitats increased. Additionally, we observed that the
   spectrum of pesticides in spiders increased with the dominance of
   web-building spiders. In contrast, pesticide levels in rodents were not
   affected by either landscape composition or local management type. For
   plants, pesticide distribution was affected by the proportion of forests
   and shrublands and, to some extent, by local management practices. In
   the case of soil, pesticide distribution was primarily determined by
   local management. This study marks an effort in demonstrating that both
   local and landscape factors play crucial roles in shaping pesticide
   distribution within perennial crops. Importantly, the relative
   importance of these factors varied across the four matrices
   investigated. Synthesis and applications: To comprehend the factors that
   determine pesticide distribution in crops, it is crucial to monitor
   diverse ecosystem components rather than focusing on a few model
   species. This approach underscores the necessity for ecologically
   sensitive management at landscape scale. Such management should involve
   the preservation and enhancement of (semi)natural habitats around crops.
   These combined insights can form the foundation for conservation and
   management initiatives aimed at mitigating the impact of pesticides on
   biodiversity within crops.},

Abstract = {Agroecological-based practices (ABPs) play a vital role in urban
   vegetable gardens, enhancing the quality of life. However, factors
   driving ABP implementation and their impact on crop production and
   diversity are not fully understood. Our study assessed the influence of
   socio-economic and environmental characteristics on ABP adoption, crop
   diversity, and total weight vegetable production in San Carlos de
   Bariloche, Argentina. Through interviews and a multi-model inference
   approach, we found that ABP implementation is tied to gardener
   experience and formative assets (e.g. horticultural experience, specific
   training). Crop diversity, integral to ABP, is affected by farming
   practices and farmer characteristics (Farm animals, Pollinator-friendly
   practices, Experience, Additional training and Environmental knowledge).
   The Total weight produced was primarily influenced by the type of
   garden, the gardener's experience and some ABPs. Long-standing
   commercial and community objectives and the use of farm animals and
   commercial seed led to greater production. Strengthening key drivers,
   such as farmer training, through public policies (e.g. income
   generation, financing, specific training, land access) can bolster the
   role of urban gardens in providing a healthy environment and promoting
   food sovereignty.},

   Richness and Total Abundance Across Land-Use Types},
Journal = {INSECTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Geographic Information Systems provide the means to explore the spatial
   distribution of insect species across various land-use types to
   understand their relationship with shared or overlapping spatiotemporal
   resources. Blow fly species richness and total fly abundance were
   correlated among six land-use types (residential, commercial, waste,
   woods, roads, and agricultural crop types) and distance to streams. To
   generate multivariate models of species richness and total fly
   abundance, blow fly trapping sites were chosen across the land-use
   gradient of Windsor-Essex County (Ontario, Canada) using a stratified
   random sampling approach. Sampling occurred in mid-June (spring), late
   August (summer), and late October (fall). Spring species richness
   correlated highest to residential (-), woods (-), distance to streams
   (+), and tomato fields (+) in models across all three land-use buffer
   scale distances (0.5, 1, 2 km), with waste (+/-), roads (-), wheat/corn
   (-), and commercial (-) correlating at only two of the three scales.
   Spring total fly abundance correlated with all but one land-use variable
   across all buffer scale distances, but the distance to streams (+),
   followed by orchards/vineyards (+) exhibited the greatest importance to
   these models. Summer blow fly species richness correlated with roads (-)
   and commercial (+) across all buffer distances, whereas at two of three
   buffer distances wheat/corn (-), residential (+), distance to streams
   (+), waste (-), and orchards/vineyards (+) were also important. Summer
   total fly abundance correlated to models with distance to streams (+),
   orchards/vineyards (+), and sugar beets/other vegetables (+) at the 2 km
   scale. Species richness and total abundance models at the 0.5 km buffer
   distance exhibited the highest correlation, lowest root mean square
   error, and similar prediction error to those derived at larger buffer
   distances. This study provides baseline methods and models for future
   validation and expansion of species-specific knowledge regarding adult
   blow fly relationships with spatiotemporal resources across land-use
   types and landscape features.},

   potential for improving the ecological value of permeable areas.
   Medium-density developments prioritising communal space had the highest

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The increasing densification of urban spaces can negatively impact
   biodiversity in the city, but the diversity of green spaces also offers
   new opportunities to implement biodiversity conservation interventions.
   Urban community gardens are social-ecological systems that support
   biodiversity, ecosystem services, and positive humannature interactions.
   In turn, community gardens can provide ideal ``real-world labs{''} to
   co-create, test, and collectively implement biodiversity conservation
   strategies with gardeners that can be transferred to and mainstreamed
   across other urban ecosystems. This is important because the impact of
   biodiversity-friendly gardening strategies is not yet systematically
   researched, nor how this knowledge can be transferred to other urban
   ecosystems. In our transdisciplinary research, we are developing,
   implementing, and testing biodiversity conservation interventions
   focused on promoting insect diversity with gardeners and neighborhood
   residents from Berlin and Munich, Germany. Our aim is to engage with and
   support city residents in biodiversity-based urban greening. To do so,
   we work at the nexus between civil society (gardeners, neighborhood
   residents, ecologically oriented organizations) and relevant city actors
   (city council, district committees, city administration) to anchor the
   participation of civil society in the ecological transformation of the
   city. In this communication article, we present our transdisciplinary

Title = {Assessing the strategic role of urban green spaces for habitat
   connectivity in multi-family residential plots},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {99},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Urban green spaces are key for maintaining and restoring habitat
   connectivity within cities. Despite substantial investigations on the
   contribution to connectivity of different types of urban green spaces,
   the specific contribution of green spaces located in multifamily
   residential (MFR) plots has yet to be assessed. Estimating this
   contribution is crucial given the multiple roles fulfilled by these
   green spaces in urban planning. To achieve this goal, we focused on four
   taxa: the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), the Red squirrel
   (Sciurus vulgaris), forest passerine birds and moths. We assessed the
   potential habitat connectivity for each taxon across the metropolitan
   urban area of Lyon (France), with landscape graphs built using 1-metre
   resolution land cover maps. Considering the current state as a
   reference, we then designed five land cover change scenarios affecting
   habitat distribution in the MFR plots: (i) maximum and (ii) minimum
   theoretical connectivity (references), (iii) improve quality of existing
   green spaces, (iv) improve quantity of green spaces with sub-optimal
   quality and, (v) maximum restoration (management scenarios). The taxon-
   and scenario-specific impacts highlight the crucial contribution of
   private spaces to habitat connectivity. For all taxa, while the MFR only
   cover 8 \% of the study area, connectivity would increase by up to 60\%
   if these plots were greened. In contrast, sealing these plots could
   reduce overall connectivity by up to 40 \%. The interpolation of local
   connectivity metrics for each habitat patch and each MFR plot allowed us
   to identify the most relevant plots for urban greening. Because our
   approach can improve habitat connectivity at different scales, from
   neighbourhoods to entire urban areas, it could prove useful for
   landscape planning in most urban settings.},

Abstract = {Cities are increasingly recognised as important sites for biodiversity
   and essential for improving human-nature connections. However, urban
   areas are also hotspots for rats, which negatively impact biodiversity
   due to competition and depredation. Urban residents may undertake rat
   control on their properties, but the effectiveness of such volunteer
   initiatives for broader biodiversity outcomes has not been tested in
   urban environments. We conducted a comprehensive study inclusive of rat
   abundance, adult bird diversity, and bird breeding success. We monitored
   rat (Norway rat Rattus norvegicus; ship rat Rattus rattus) presence and
   modelled detection probabilities and occupancy in suburban residential
   backyards in Auckland, New Zealand. We also compared bird abundance and
   richness among backyards and recorded 140 nesting attempts from 15 bird
   species between September 2021 and February 2022. Despite rat control,
   rats were detected at some point in all backyards, though relative
   abundance was low, and fewer rats were detected in backyards with more
   frequent rat control. Higher bird abundance, and to a lesser extent
   richness, were associated with proximity to native vegetation patches
   and more frequent rat control. Overall fledging success was relatively
   high and predation by rats was relatively low compared to previous
   research. Nest survival was slightly higher for introduced bird species.
   Daily nest survival rate increased with nest height, proximity to native
   vegetation patches, and when rat detection rates decreased. Although the
   effect was small, frequent rat control within a backyard was associated
   with increased fledging success and increased bird species richness and
   abundance. Further research is required to explore the factors that
   interact with backyard rat control to improve local outcomes for birds.
   High levels of community participation in backyard rat control are
   required to improve neighbourhood-wide outcomes for birds.},

   Employing repeated-measures analysis of variance, forty-one participants

   gauged through heart rate variability and skin conductance, while
   psychological evaluations utilized the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and
   Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Findings revealed that
   (1) natural soundscapes-especially birdsong, flowing water, wind, and
   bamboo raft sounds-and visual elements, such as distant mountains,
   streams, trees, Danxia landforms, tea gardens, and bamboo views, play
   pivotal roles in regulating heart rate variability, reducing arousal,

   activity. (2) Natural and cultural auditory stimuli, including flowing
   water and classical music, coupled with visual features, such as Danxia
   landforms, streams, distant mountains, lawns, and guide signs,
   effectively induce positive mood states, regulate mood disturbances, and

   findings underscore the significant health benefits of immersive natural

Year = {2024},
Volume = {98},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As urbanization progresses globally, there is a growing concern
   regarding the diminishing connection between humans and nature. Informal
   green spaces (IGS) have been identified as a potential solution to this,
   offering unscripted opportunities for urban residents to engage with
   nature in a way that is not possible in formally planned parks and
   gardens. Despite an increasing focus on IGS, we are still developing our
   understanding of the extent to which people use these spaces to interact
   with nature. Our work addresses this research gap by employing a spatial
   analysis method to map IGS within Greater Melbourne, Australia. We used
   citizen science data to analyse the location and density of human-nature
   interactions on IGS compared to formal green spaces, as well as
   comparing different types of IGS and formal green spaces. Our findings
   revealed no significant difference in the density of citizen science
   observations between IGS and formal green spaces, once the variance in
   available area of each land use is accounted for. Notably, railway and
   utility easements exhibited the highest density of citizen science
   observations among all types of IGS. This research demonstrates that IGS
   make an important contribution to urban green space networks and
   additional thought should be given to how urban planning and land
   management may further increase the value of these spaces for people

   unclear why the species' breeding range and global population are
   extremely small, as it occurs in human-occupied forest-agricultural
   landscapes similar to surrounding environments across southern China.
   3. We conducted systematic range-wide interviews on BCLT (n = 519) to
   collect novel information on the species' temporal and spatial
   distribution, and on potential human activities and landscape changes
   associated with its presence or absence. Recognition of BCLT was
   moderate (45.0\% of respondents reported sightings), with sightings
   within the previous 18 months across the study area, within and beyond
   their known distribution. Over half of known breeding villages were
   confirmed by LEK data, and nesting was reported from two villages with
   no previous breeding records.
   4. BCLT trapping was reported across the study landscape, mostly from
   the last decade and associated with trappers from urban centres. BCLT
   trapping and lack of fengshui forest were associated with sites where
   BCLTs did not breed. Breeding sites were associated with increases in
   vegetable gardens over respondents' lifetimes, and other sites within
   the species' range were associated with decreases in bush/scrub.
   5. We demonstrate that LEK can identify potential threats, new breeding
   sites and landscape changes correlated with species presence or absence
   for threatened birds affected by the Asian songbird crisis. This study
   provides the first evidence of ongoing trapping as a threat to BCLT, and
   remedial measures are urgently required across the region.},

Abstract = {To better understand how frequently pollinators visit the most popular
   annuals and the variation among cultivars, we evaluated 3-6 cultivars,
   each of petunia, impatiens, begonia, geranium, pansy, and New Guinea
   impatiens. These 6 annuals account for 46.6\% of all garden center
   annual flower sales in the United States. Flower visits by honey bees,
   bumble bees, syrphids, other Diptera and other Hymenoptera, combined,
   varied 3 to 10-fold among cultivars within each of the 6 popular
   annuals. Begonia and impatiens were visited more frequently by
   pollinators than pansy, petunia, NG impatiens, and geranium. The 4 most
   visited cultivars, begonia `Cocktail Brandy', begonia `Ambassador Rose
   Blush', impatiens `Accent Coral', and impatiens `Super Elfin XP White'
   attracted as many pollinators as a benchmark annual, marigold `Alumia
   Vanilla Cream', considered as moderately attractive to pollinators. Some
   conclusions from this research may be helpful for homeowners,
   landscapers, growers, and breeders. First, the most popular annual
   flowers are not a good choice for the purpose of attracting and
   supporting pollinators. However, the large variation among cultivars
   provides an opportunity to select cultivars that are more attractive to
   pollinators, particularly for begonia and impatiens. If the most
   pollinator-visited cultivars of begonia and impatiens are labeled and
   promoted as such, it would be beneficial to pollinators in urban and
   suburban landscapes in the USA and Europe, where they comprise 10\%-20\%
   of all annual flowers purchased from garden centers.},

Title = {Influence of Vineyard Inter-Row Management on Grapevine Leafhoppers and
   Their Natural Enemies},
Journal = {INSECTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Simple Summary: The inter-row management strategy in the vineyard
   influences the diversity of the vegetation and, consequently, the
   presence and activity of natural enemies of grapevine pests. This study
   aims to evaluate whether the replacement of periodical tillage with the
   alternate mowing of the resident herbaceous vegetation in vineyard
   inter-rows reduces the density of the European leafhoppers Hebata vitis
   and Zygina rhamni by improving the presence and activity of their
   natural enemies in the context of conservation biological control. The
   results show that, on grapevines with ground vegetation, the number of
   hunting spiders increases, thus reducing the leafhopper population with
   their predation activity. Green covering also improves hymenopteran
   parasitoids characterized for their important role in the grapevine pest
   control. A greater vegetation diversity in the vineyard improves the
   landscape quality of the agroecosystem and, by supporting the activity
   of the natural enemies of grapevine pests, reduces the need for
   insecticide applications in the vineyards. Inter-row management in
   vineyards can influence the abundance of grapevine pests and their
   natural enemies. In 2013-2015, in a vineyard in northeastern Italy, the
   influence of two vineyard inter-row management strategies (i.e.,
   alternate mowing, AM, and periodical tillage, PT) on the population
   dynamics of grapevine leafhoppers Hebata vitis and Zygina rhamni and
   their natural enemies, the mymarid Anagrus atomus and spiders (Araneae),
   and other hymenopteran parasitoids, were studied with different survey
   approaches. The infestations of both leafhoppers were lower in AM than
   PT due to the reduced leafhopper oviposition and higher nymph mortality
   in AM. This occurred although leafhopper egg parasitization by A. atomus
   was greater in PT than AM according to a density-dependent relationship
   with the leafhopper egg amount. Hymenopteran parasitoids other than A.
   atomus were the most abundant in AM, probably due to the higher
   availability of nectar and pollen than in PM. The significantly higher
   population densities of hunting spiders in AM than PT can be associated
   with the higher predation of leafhopper nymphs. Therefore, the study
   demonstrated that the alternate mowing of vineyard inter-rows enhances
   the abundance of natural enemies, such as spiders and hymenopteran
   parasitoids, and can contribute to grapevine leafhopper pest control.},

Title = {The influence of climate and management on transpiration of residential
   trees during a bark beetle infestation},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Trees in residential environments are affected by a unique combination
   of environmental and anthropogenic factors, including occasional insect
   outbreaks that are increasing in frequency and severity due to climate
   change. We studied loblolly pine trees infested by bark beetles in a
   residential backyard in a southeastern US city. We investigated the
   responses of tree and stand-level transpiration to environmental factors
   (solar radiation, atmospheric vapor pressure deficit, and soil
   moisture), severe weather events (strong winds and heavy storms), bark
   beetle infestation, and human actions (insecticide treatments and tree
   removals). We used constant heat dissipation probes to make continuous
   sap flux measurements (J(0)) in tree boles. Over 22 months of the study,
   J(0) of trees with confirmed infestation decreased from similar to 90 to
   similar to 60 g cm(-2) day(-1) and J(0) of the rest of the trees
   increased from similar to 60 to similar to 80 g cm(-2) day(-1). One
   infested tree died, as its J(0) steadily declined from 110 g cm(-2)
   day(-1) to zero over the course of 2 months, followed by a loss of
   foliage and visible signs of severe infestation 6 months later. J(0) was
   sensitive to variations in incoming solar radiation and atmospheric
   vapor pressure deficit. In most trees, J(0) linearly responded to soil
   water content during drought periods. Yet despite complex dynamics of
   J(0) variations, plot-level transpiration at the end of the study was
   the same as at the beginning due to compensatory increases in tree
   transpiration rates. This study highlights the intrinsic interplay of
   environmental, biotic, and anthropogenic factors in residential
   environments where human actions may directly mediate ecosystem
   responses to climate.},

Abstract = {Herein we present the first-known case report of a structural
   infestation by the bird flea (Dasypsyllus gallinulae perpinnatus) (Dale
   1878) in the United States. In March of 2023, the San Mateo County
   Mosquito and Vector Control District was contacted by a resident in
   South San Francisco, CA who reported the presence of fleas inside their
   condominium. The resident had 2 dogs who were on oral flea medication
   and only 1 inhabitant out of 4 reported receiving flea bites. The front
   walkway, backyard, and garage were flagged and a small passerine nest
   was removed from a fire alarm bell in the front walkway. A total of 31
   fleas (13 males, 18 females) were collected by flagging from the front
   entryway underneath the nest. One female flea was collected from the
   backyard, and 20 (9 males, 11 females) were collected by the resident
   from inside the house. A total of 387 fleas (163 males, 224 females)
   were collected from the nest of a small passerine. All life stages (egg,
   larvae, pupae, and adult) were observed within the nest. Additional
   parasites in the nest included bird lice and larval western black-legged
   ticks (Ixodes pacificus, Cooley and Kohls 1943). Research should be
   conducted into whether bird fleas are capable of transmitting avian
   pathogens to humans and this information should be communicated to
   healthcare providers as part of a One Health approach. Additionally,
   resources to aid in species-level flea identification should be made
   accessible to pest control operators as this will aid the development of
   targeted treatments as part of an integrated pest management plan.},

Abstract = {European Robins are well known for defending a winter territory. Both
   resident birds and newly arrived migrants defend a winter territory.
   However, little is known about the timing and drivers of the settlement
   of the winter territory in autumn. We hypothesized that settlement is
   triggered by the arrival of migratory Robins from the North. The
   hypothesis was tested by relating observational data on first autumn
   song (as indicator for the settlement of a winter territory) of European
   Robins in a back yard in the North of the Netherlands to nationwide
   arrival dates of migratory European Robins in the Netherlands. Date of
   first autumn song in the studied yard advanced significantly with 14
   days from 1993 to 2021, but there was no significant relationship with
   nationwide autumn arrival dates. We conclude that first autumn song (as
   indicator of settlement of winter territory) in European Robin does not
   seem to be triggered by the arrival of (conspecific) migrants. We
   suggest instead that advanced timing of breeding caused the advancement
   of winter territory settlement. Climate change may allow resident Robins
   to moult earlier and settle before conspecific migrants arrive. However,
   this suggestion needs further testing.},

Abstract = {Green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) promises to improve stormwater
   management while making landscapes more sustainable. The ability of GSI
   to achieve water quality objectives and provide socioeconomic cobenefits
   depends in part on public perceptions and support. This study
   contributes to the literature on public perceptions of top-down,
   municipal-scale GSI. We examined variation in public support for planned
   rain gardens and the factors associated with support in a large
   Midwestern city in the US. We collected survey data (N=588) in two
   socioeconomically distinct neighborhoods and fit multivariate linear
   regression models to explore how variables derived from economics,
   landscape ecology, and outreach and engagement literatures impact
   support. There was little difference in support between neighborhoods.
   The expectation of increased property values and improved neighborhood
   appearance, alignment with personal norms and experience with
   conservation landscaping, and satisfaction with outreach and engagement
   programs were significantly associated with higher support. In addition,
   strong neighborhood identity magnified the effects of several variables.
   These results suggest that planners should work with communities to
   identify rain garden designs and locations that balance functionality
   with aesthetic preferences to minimize potential negative socioeconomic
   effects while meeting stormwater management objectives. Proactive
   community engagement that is attentive to local norms and values and
   identifies appropriate rain garden maintenance plans could improve the
   long-term effectiveness of GSI by increasing the likelihood of local
   support.
   Cities are increasingly using technologies called green stormwater
   infrastructure (GSI) to manage drainage water, including flooding and
   sewage overflows to waterways. Common examples of GSI in urban areas are
   rain gardens and permeable pavement. Vegetated with perennial plants,
   rain gardens potentially offer additional benefits to urban environments
   such as pollinator habitat, lower summer heat, and improved community
   aesthetics, which can enhance health and well-being from activities like
   increased exercise. However, installing rain gardens alters the
   landscape, which can be viewed positively or negatively by residents.
   Public views on rain gardens are important because if viewed negatively,
   fewer people benefit and otherwise-effective GSI programs could fail to
   be pursued. On the other hand, community support for GSI could lead to
   long-term viability of the infrastructure and its benefits. We studied
   public perceptions of GSI in Columbus, Ohio, where the city planned to
   install rain gardens throughout residential neighborhoods. Residents
   were more likely to be supportive of planned rain gardens if they (1)
   felt they would improve their property values and appearance of the
   neighborhood, (2) felt sufficiently informed by the city about the rain
   garden plans, and (3) already had experience with conservation
   landscaping at home.},

Abstract = {In the face of global forest ecosystem decline, non-protected
   transboundary areas like agroforestry can play a crucial role for
   conserving avian species. A comprehensive study on agroforestry birds in
   Tetulia, the northernmost area of Bangladesh, was conducted across four
   sites from November 2021 to October 2022. A total of 174 species (5479
   contacts) of avifauna were recorded. The order Passeriformes had the
   highest avian diversity (70 species, 40.22\%), followed by
   Charadriiformes (20 species, 11.50\%), Accipitriformes (17 species,
   9.77\%), and Pelecaniformes (13 species,7.47\%). The species list showed
   that resident birds were higher (122 species, 70.11\%) than migratory
   birds (52 species, 29.89\%). The highest richness (144 species),
   abundance (N = 1581), and diversity (H = 4.522, Ds = 0.984) were
   observed in site A1. The heterogenous nature of site A1 contributed to
   this result although spatial bird diversity was non-significant. The
   highest species richness, abundance, and diversity indices of birds
   showed in the winter season because of the presence of migratory
   species. The frequent bird activity, less anthropogenic pressure, and
   high detection probability during winter can influence the seasonal bird
   diversity result. The homestead habitats displayed the highest diversity
   indices (H = 4.051, Ds = 0.977) and evenness (E = 0.736) due to the
   diversity of plants. Birds in tea garden and agricultural land shared
   similar species, while water bodies associated with tea garden had more
   distinct species with a negative correlation value. The low-contrast
   edge between tea garden and agricultural land made a positive relation
   in bird composition. The top ten abundant species contributed 28.71\% of
   total and jungle babbler (Turdoides striata) had the highest relative
   abundance. The baseline data we have collected holds significant
   potential for informing future research endeavors. Policymakers can
   leverage this foundational information to initiate conservation measures
   aimed at protecting the avifauna within the study site.},

Pages = {298-304},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Nest reuse is often observed in large- and medium-sized birds, including
   hole-nesters, while in smaller passerines building open-cup nests it is
   rarely recorded. In this note we report a case of multiple nest reuse,
   observed in a residential garden in Poland. The nest was located on the
   wall of a farm building partly overgrown by Boston Ivy at the height of
   2.3 m. The nest was occupied eight times between 2007 and 2023 by three
   bird species: Grey and Pied Wagtails and Common Blackbirds. The nest was
   built by Grey Wagtails in 2007, but in 2009 it was reconstructed
   considerably by blackbirds. The Blackbird cup with mud lining survived
   until 2023 and contained all other nests. We suggest that the most
   plausible reason for multiple nest reuse was the high quality of this
   nest site. However, we also found that the nest was used during warm,
   dry springs but avoided when weather conditions at the beginning of the
   breeding season were adverse. We hypothesize that cold and wet springs -
   thought to be associated with high costs of reproduction - may have
   influenced birds' decision not to reuse the nest. To our knowledge, this
   is the longest case of nest reuse reported for passerines building
   open-cup nests.},

   observations were made in the city of Oryol (52 degrees 58 ` N, 36
   degrees 05 ` E) located in the Central Federal District of the Russian
   Federation and having an area of 121.2 km(2) , with a population of
   303.7 thousand and distance from Moscow of 368 km. The studies began in
   2006, at the moment when the urban population of the Woodpigeon started
   to form within the Oryol administrative borders, and ended in 2021. In
   June 2019 and July 2021, counts of singing individuals and nest search
   activities were carried out in forest and recreational parks, squares,
   cemeteries, on specially selected plots among individual houses, and in
   green residential areas with predominantly five-storied apartment
   buildings. In total, 26 census plots with an aggregate area of about
   228.9 ha were surveyed. Associated observations were also made,
   including Woodpigeon nest search in all administrative districts of the
   city. The degree of introduction of the Woodpigeon into the Oryol urban
   landscapes was evaluated by the use of five synanthropization stages
   (from 0 to 4).<br /> The paper shows that the urban population of the
   Woodpigeon in Oryol, as it was the case in other European urban areas,
   started from the birds which began to nest at the urban periphery, in
   less transformed habitats, and is dated back to 2006. Afterwards the
   birds were reported breeding in the built-up part of the city, including
   the city center, with the first breeding case in the built-up part
   reported in 2016. The number of nests found in the built-up part of the
   city grew in the following years. Now the birds nest across the entire
   city, including its central part, where their nests are found both along
   highways with intense traffic and in yards in residential areas with
   predominantly five- storied apartment buildings. The species is
   registered as breeding in forest and recreational parks, cemeteries,
   among individual houses and in green residential areas. The average
   population density in the said habitats ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 pairs/10
   ha, with the average for the entire city being 0.8 pairs/10 ha. The
   highest population density is registered in cemeteries (1.5 pairs/10 ha)
   and forest parks (1.1 pairs/10 ha). The population density in green
   residential areas with predominantly five-storied apartment buildings is
   0.9 pairs/10 ha ( see Table 1 ). In general, the Woodpigeon population
   in Oryol is much smaller than in many other urban areas in Europe and in
   Northwest Africa ( see Table 2 ), which is attributed to the longer
   history of urban populations there. All nests found were located on
   trees and bushes, with none found on man-made structures.<br /> The high
   numbers of the Hooded Crow are among the factors hindering colonization
   of urban habitats by the Woodpigeon in European cities and towns. At the
   same time, the Hooded Crow is an uncommon breeder in Oryol. The Magpie,
   another nest predator, is a rather common breeder in the city: its
   breeding density was 2.2 nests/10 ha in green residential areas and 1.5
   nests/10 ha among individual houses.
   Urban-breeding Woodpigeon aggregations generally make long-distance
   foraging movements to nearby farmlands where the birds obtain additional
   food. The agroclimatic conditions of Orlovsky District, which surrounds
   the city, are characterized as the most attractive for crop cultivation.
   Thus, the low numbers of the Hooded Crow and presence of large areas
   occupied by grain crops around the city make up favorable conditions for
   the establishment of an urban population of the Woodpigeon in Oryol.<br
   /> The urban Woodpigeon population in Oryol is at the stage 3 - breeding
   in urban parks in a high density and regular breeding in residential
   areas (on residential streets). The population under study has not yet
   reached the synanthropization stage 4, when the species breeds in a high
   density in urban parks and residential areas, with individual pairs
   transitioning to breeding on man-made structures.},

Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Non-commercial chickens may be the third most numerous pets in Western
   countries. Yet, to date, there is limited research into their welfare or
   the care-taking practices and attitudes of their guardians. Using a
   quantitative questionnaire, this study investigated non-commercial
   chicken owners' care-taking practices, attitudes, and relationship types
   with their chickens. Additionally, the study investigated barriers to
   optimizing non-commercial chicken welfare. Specific questions were asked
   regarding niche care-taking practices, including the use of Suprelorin
   (R) implants. With 2000+ responses, this study found variable
   care-taking practices, yet largely positive attitudes towards chickens,
   and a ``personal{''} (though not ``close personal{''}) owner-chicken
   relationship, as defined by the Owner-Bird Relationship Scale. The
   Chicken Attitude Scale, Owner-Bird Relationship Scale, and Care Series
   scores were found to be correlated with each other, with coefficients
   ranging from 0.176 to 0.543 (p < 0.001). ``Preventing commercial
   chickens from going to slaughter{''} was a key motive for chicken care
   by 56.1\% of respondents, with 69.6\% of respondents stating they cared
   for ex-commercial chickens. This study found a higher prevalence of
   reported poor health conditions and number of deaths relative to prior
   studies, and egg yolk peritonitis emerged as a leading health condition
   and cause of death. Moreover, 68.0\% had not heard of Suprelorin (R)
   implants, and only 6.3\% used implants. Most (76.4\%) chicken carers
   followed an omnivorous diet that includes chicken meat/eggs. The results
   reinforced previous findings concerning a need for more
   avian-specialist, locally available, and affordable veterinary care for
   chickens. Research into Suprelorin (R) implants, rooster-specific care,
   and tailored requirements of caring for ex-commercial chickens is
   recommended.},

Title = {Native flora receive more visits than exotics from bees, especially
   native bees, in an urbanised biodiversity hotspot},
Journal = {PACIFIC CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Context Identifying floral resources preferred by bee assemblages is
   important for their conservation.Aims Here, I assess the association of
   flowering plant community composition, with that of honey bees and
   native bee abundance and diversity. I investigate flower preferences in
   terms of plant origin (native or exotic), and evaluate niche breadth, of
   introduced honey bees and native bee taxa. I also consider if habitat
   influences these patterns.Methods This was evaluated through recording
   flower visitation by honey bees and native bees in the urbanised region
   of the south-west Western Australian Floristic Region in seven bushland
   remnants and seven residential gardens over 2 years.Key results Both
   native bees and honey bees visited more native than exotic flora,
   however native bees visited a higher proportion of native flora than
   honey bees. The 10-most visited plants by native bees were exclusively
   native, whereas for honey bees, although their 10-most visited plants
   were predominantly native plant species, this selection also included
   exotic plant species. Niche breadth was broader in bushland remnants,
   indicating a greater range of preferred flora in bushland remnants.
   Honey bees however visited more plant families in residential gardens.
   With increased honey bee abundance, this was associated with native bees
   expanding their niche breadth, which may be a response to reduce
   competition. Flower preference patterns and niche breadth often differed
   between habitats, indicating that foraging patterns may be mediated by
   habitat context.Conclusion Native flora are preferred by bees, and
   native bees have relatively restricted flower preferences, especially
   compared with honey bees.Implications High proportions of preferred
   native flora are needed to support diverse native bee assemblages in
   urban areas.
   In the urbanised areas of the south-west Western Australian biodiversity
   hotspot, both native bees and honey bees visit more native than exotic
   flora, however native bees visit a higher proportion of native flora
   than honey bees. Conserving bees in urban greenspaces requires high
   proportions of preferred native flora.},

Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {BackgroundHomegardens in agricultural areas are important refuges for
   pollinators and other valuable species due to the extensive plant
   diversity therein. Yet, plant diversity may strongly depend on the
   identity of the gardeners and their knowledge of plant identification
   and plant uses.ObjectiveIn this study, we used botanical surveys and
   homegardener interviews to explore plant diversity in homegardens in
   coffee-producing regions of Colombia, and to examine how homegardener
   identity influences their knowledge of plants, plant uses, and
   motivations for maintaining a homegarden.MethodsWe collected information
   in three villages in Cauca, Colombia and interviewed campesino (n = 30)
   and indigenous (n = 30) homegardeners. Half of the respondents from each
   social group were women and half were men.Results and discussionOf the
   566 plant species that we detected in botanical surveys, the most
   recognized spontaneous herbs among homegardeners were ``papunga{''}
   (Bidens pilosa, n = 38), ``lechuguilla{''} (Emilia sonchifolia, n = 32),
   and ``escoba{''} (Sida acuta, n = 31). Homegardeners identified multiple
   uses of spontaneous herbs including for food, material, medicine, plants
   for bees, and other environmental, conservation, or social uses. In
   addition, three different groups of gardeners emerged from social
   groupings and interview responses: (1) indigenous men with little
   knowledge of the uses of spontaneous herbs; (2) indigenous and campesino
   women who considered it beneficial to have flowers and crops for
   pollinators; and (3) male farmers who described detailed mutualistic
   plant-pollinator interactions that benefit crops, and who use
   spontaneous herbs to maintain soil moisture. In conclusion,
   homegardeners kept very diverse gardens and identified spontaneous herbs
   and pollinator functions, but this strongly depended on age, knowledge,
   and social group. Thus, homegarden presence within agricultural
   landscapes is of great importance to sustain functional biodiversity and
   ecosystem services in Colombian agroecosystems.ConclusionIn conclusion,

Title = {The misbeliefs and food taboos during pregnancy and early infancy: a
   pitfall to attaining adequate maternal and child nutrition outcomes
   among the rural Acholi communities in Northern Uganda},
Journal = {BMC NUTRITION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {BackgroundIn developing countries, the practice of food taboo is
   pervasive. The types of foods considered as taboos and the reasons
   attached to taboos vary from society to society. Food taboos have been
   recognized as one of the factors contributing to maternal undernutrition
   in pregnancy, especially in rural settings. In the rural Acholi
   community where malnutrition is prevalent, very little is known about
   these food taboos and misbeliefs. This study, therefore, aims to explore
   various misbeliefs and food taboos in the time of pregnancy that can
   influence maternal and child nutrition outcomes in Acholi.MethodsA
   community-based qualitative cross-sectional study was conducted between
   April and May 2022 in five districts in the Acholi subregion. Focus
   group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) were used
   to collect data. Data transcription was done verbatim, organised into
   themes, assigned unique color codes, and manually analysed
   thematically.ResultsUpon scrutiny of the transcripts, three themes were
   eminent. The first theme focused on foods that are considered taboos in
   Acholi community and the reasons linked to them. Participants indicated
   offals, chicken, wild birds, smoked meat and fish, sugarcane, garden egg
   ('Tula'), groundnut, bush meat, mushrooms, honey, sour fruits, or meals
   (oranges, mango, passion fruits, lemon, tamarind, `Malakwang'), goat's
   meat, `Lalaa' (the bitter green leafy vegetable), and `Lamola' (Hyptis
   spicigera) as the major taboo foods. The second theme was the reasons
   underlying the adherence to the food taboos and misconceptions. Cultural
   dictates, individual characteristics, and societal context were the main
   reasons for the adherence to food taboos. The third theme looked at the
   misconceptions and other taboos during pregnancy. It was found that
   pregnant women are not allowed to touch grave soil, shave their hair,
   walk over an anthill, slaughter chicken or birds, have sex during
   pregnancy, sit on animal's hide or skin, and/or touch
   needles.ConclusionsNutritional counseling and education should focus
   more on addressing food taboos. The mode of delivery of the nutrition
   message should be inclusive, targeting pregnant women and their spouses,
   school-going children, adolescent girls, and cultural leaders at their
   respective points of contact.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The geographic range of the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus)
   has rapidly been expanding within the United States for the last 150
   years. One of the factors contributing to this astounding range
   expansion is the species' ability to survive in and colonize
   human-dominated areas. Despite the fact that armadillos live alongside
   humans in numerous towns and cities across the Southeastern,
   Southcentral, and now Midwestern United States, we know relatively
   little about the behavior and ecology of armadillos in human-developed
   areas. Here, we used motion-triggered game cameras in over 115
   residential yards in the rapidly developing Northwest corner of Arkansas
   to survey armadillos in a largely suburban environment. Our objectives
   were to explore trends in armadillo occupancy and daily activity
   patterns in a suburban setting. We documented armadillos in
   approximately 84\% of the yards surveyed indicating that the species was
   widespread throughout the environment. We found that the species was
   more likely to occupy yards surrounded by a high proportion of forest
   cover. We found no relationship between armadillo occupancy and other
   land cover or development covariates. Only 2\% of nearly 2000 armadillo
   detections occurred during the day indicating that the species is almost
   exclusively nocturnal during the summer months when living near humans
   in the suburban environment, which we suggest is likely an adaptation to
   avoid contact with humans and their dogs. As the armadillo continues to
   expand its geographic range to areas where it has not previously
   occurred, understanding how human development supports and facilitates
   the spread of this species can elucidate areas where conflict between
   humans and armadillos might occur allowing for preemptive management or
   education to mitigate conflict.},

   preserved. We combined a literature review on the cultural value of
   sweet basil and the breeding of local genetic resources with an online
   questionnaire, directed to adult laypeople, that sought to access
   different aspects of past (recalled) and present use and related
   knowledge. The identification skills of the participants were tested
   using images of local plant landraces and foreign varieties. Responses
   from 220 participants showed that potted ``Genovese{''}-type individual
   was most frequently identified as sweet basil (89.9\%), followed by two
   examples of local landraces in flower. Participants who grow sweet basil
   or used it in more varied ways had significantly better identification
   skills. Ocimum basilicum was most frequently reported as food, while
   ritual/symbolic use was preserved while devalued during the Communism
   regime (1945-1989). Food and religious uses were negatively associated
   in the past, but presently, the tendency is completely reversed.

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {IntroductionNature-based solutions (NBS) have been used to address a
   wide range of urban environmental challenges, an important aspect of
   which is to improve human health and well-being. However, most relevant
   studies focus either on what positive influences nature may have or on
   identifying what natural factors can have these benefits. Few have
   investigated the sensory composition of nature and the effects of nature
   in different sensory aspects on human health. Setting out from the
   multi-sensory perspective, this study aims to explore human behavior and
   emotional response from visual and aural contact with urban nature.
   MethodsTaking Jiangjia Art Garden in Chengdu as an example, natural
   attributes such as its visual (landscape) and aural (sound source)
   characteristics as well as people's activities (behavioral responses)
   were measured by on-site mapping analysis. This was done while a
   questionnaire-based survey was conducted to investigate people's
   emotional responses regarding their overall satisfaction, pleasantness,
   calm, and agreeableness. ResultsThe results indicated that
   nature-dominated visual landscapes such as grassland, waterscapes, and
   woodlands, as well as natural sounds such as bird sounds, chirp sounds,
   and wind sounds were found to be positively correlated to the vitality
   of activities and people's emotional status. Regarding behavioral
   responses, it was shown that grasslands and woodlands are more likely to
   be attractive places for recreation, and the vitality measured became
   extremely high when these two were paired with lakes. As for the
   emotional responses, people's perceived overall satisfaction, calm, and
   agreeableness were equally reflected in their behavioral patterns,
   suggesting a strong relationship with natural factors. DiscussionThe
   research findings were visually presented in behavior and emotional maps
   to provide direct cues of informing the future design of high-quality
   urban green spaces and promoting the application of aural-visual
   experience in the design of urban nature areas.},

Title = {One size does not fit all: The complex relationship between biodiversity
   and psychological well-being},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {86},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Conserving urban biodiversity is often promoted as a `win-win'
   nature-based solution that can help align public health and biodiversity
   conservation agendas. Yet, research on the relationship between
   biodiversity and psychological well-being reveals inconsistent and
   complex results. This body of research is also restricted to a few
   socio-cultural and environmental contexts and tends to ignore
   differences in individual characteristics, such as nature relatedness
   (i.e., emotional affinity to nature) and ecological knowledge, that can
   influence people's experience of biodiversity. The aim of this
   interdisciplinary research is to explore the relationships between
   biodiversity and psychological well-being, and test the moderating
   effect of nature relatedness and ecological knowledge on these
   relationships. An ecological survey was conducted in 24 small urban
   gardens in Israel to measure the richness and abundance of birds,
   butterflies and plants, as well as land cover characteristics. In
   parallel, a social survey (close-ended questionnaires) was conducted
   in-situ to measure psychological well-being, nature relatedness,
   ecological knowledge, perceived species richness and socio-demographic
   variables. Psychological well-being measures were mostly associated with
   the cover of woody species, perceived species richness, and to a lesser
   extent, with actual species richness and abundance, for all taxa. Nature
   relatedness moderated these relationships. Respondents with high nature
   relatedness demonstrated positive well-being-richness relationships,
   while those with intermediate, or low nature relatedness showed no, or
   even negative relationships, respectively. Opposite relationships were
   recorded for bird abundance. Overall, individuals demonstrated poor
   ecological knowledge and this variable moderated only few relations
   between well-being measures, perceived butterfly richness and bird
   abundance. Our results demonstrate that one-size-does-not-fit-all when
   considering the relationship between psychological well-being and
   biodiversity, and that affinity to nature is a key moderator for this
   relationship. Designing urban green spaces that provide inclusive and
   meaningful nature experiences and foster emotional affinity to nature,
   is therefore key to aligning ecological and social objectives for
   sustainable urban planning.},

Abstract = {Gardens in cities have been the focus of a wider public health debate in
   Europe's polluted and dense cities, for the elderly and considering the
   current COVID-19 pandemic. Many cities report rising demand for
   allotment gardens by people from all age groups including young couples
   and families.This study aims at quantitatively examining the bundle of
   ecosystem services provided by allotment gardens in Berlin, Germany. It
   assesses the values related to those ecosystem services' benefits for
   gardeners and the wider urban public and compares perceptions of the
   social-environmental value of allotment gardens by gardeners and
   non-gardeners.We also compare the frequency of garden visits and the
   perception of gardens as a crucial element of the urban ecosystem by men
   and women. We carried out a web-based survey, additionally a part of the
   questionnaires was handed out in paper form for respondents who did not
   have internet access.The resulting sample of 466 gardeners and 80
   non-gardeners shows that urban allotment gardens play an important role
   in food production, biodiversity conservation, but also
   social-environmental interactions. The variety of environmental
   management practices, such as installation of artificial nests for
   insects, sowing of special flower mixtures, leaving areas with wild
   vegetation, use of organic fertilizers, including crop residues, shows
   that most respondents among gardeners are aware of the methods aimed at
   maintaining biodiversity and soil fertility in their allotment. The
   sample's analysis further states that benefits are not only perceived by
   gardeners but also by non-gardeners.We discuss our findings against the
   background of the savings and sustainable enhancement of ecosystem
   services benefits that are created by allotment gardens for all.},

Title = {Checking in at bee hotels: trap-nesting occupancy and fitness of
   cavity-nesting bees in an urbanised biodiversity hotspot},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With urbanisation leading to loss of nesting resources, and increasing
   public interest in helping bees, bee hotels (trap-nests) are becoming
   popularised. However, their success is relatively understudied. The
   influence of habitat type in determining occupancy and emergence is also
   poorly known. Over two years across 7 bushland remnant and 7 residential
   garden sites, trap-nests were installed and completed nests collected
   monthly over spring-summer. Bees appeared to take a month to find the
   trap-nests, irrespective of month they were installed. A small
   percentage (13\% and 6\% in the two years) of tubes were occupied, but
   this was within the range of other trap-nesting studies. Smaller 4 and 7
   mm diameter nests had a higher occupancy rate than 10 mm diameter tubes.
   An impressive number - 24 bee species - occupied the trap-nests.
   Representation however was dominated by five species. The species
   composition (species and their relative abundances) of cavity-nesting
   bees differed greatly between those using the trap-nests compared with
   those observed in the field. Bushland remnants tended to have more bee
   hotels occupied, and male body size of emerged bees was larger in this
   habitat. Unexpectedly native and total flower diversity reduced bee
   hotel occupancy, whereas native flower parameters tended to positively
   influence bee fitness. Overall installing bee hotels can provide
   additional nesting resources for native bees in urbanised areas, and
   providing high proportions of native flora in the vicinity should
   enhance fitness of the bees using them.},

Title = {ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE, USE AND MANAGEMENT OF MAAX IK (CAPSICUM
   ANNUUM VAR. GLABRIUSCULUM (DUNAL) HEISER \& PICKERSGILL) IN A
   RURAL MAYAN COMMUNITY},
Journal = {BOTANICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {101},
Number = {3},
Pages = {804-820},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum is the ancestor of most
   of the economically important chiles in the world. It is widely
   distributed throughout Mexico, and currently all indigenous groups
   interact with this plant species. On the Yucatan Peninsula wild chile is
   known as maax ik by the Maya. Although this area has been recognized as
   a domestication and diversification center of chile, ethnobotanical
   research on this species is still limited.
   Questions: What ecological knowledge do local people have about maax ik?
   Where and how is maax ik gathered and managed? What uses does maax ik
   currently have?
   Studied species: Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum
   Study site and dates: San Bernardo, Yucatan. Summer-Autumn 2021.
   Methods: In-depth semi-structured interviews and participatory
   observation. The management practices were identified, and management
   intensity was estimated.
   Results: Informants knew that maax ik reproduces sexually and recognized
   the role of birds in its seed dispersal. Maax ik was mainly gathered
   from homegardens where this species was tolerated and other
   non-selective incipient management practices such as protection and
   promotion were also carried out. Fruit was harvested without harming the
   plant and only a small portion of the available fruit was usually taken.
   The informants used maax ik essentially as food. The management
   intensity index was relatively high (5).
   Conclusions: Maax ik is a sustenance food resource that is sustainably
   used and non-selectively managed in homegardens by our informants in San
   Bernardo, Yucatan.},

Abstract = {Mexico has shown an increase in dengue incidence rates. There are
   factors related to the location that determine housing infestation by
   Aedes. This study aimed to determine factors associated with housing
   infestation by immature forms of Aedes spp. in the dengue endemic
   localities of Axochiapan and Tepalcingo, Mexico, from 2014 to 2016. A
   cohort study was carried out. Surveys and inspections of front- and
   backyards were conducted every 6 months, looking for immature forms of
   Aedes spp. A house condition scoring scale was developed using three
   variables (house maintenance, tidiness of the front- and backyards, and
   shading of the front- and backyards). Multiple and multilevel regression
   logistic analysis were conducted considering the housing infestation as
   the outcome and the household characteristics observed 6 months before
   the outcome as factors; this was adjusted by time (seasonal and cyclical
   variations of the vector). The infestation oscillated between 5.8\% of
   the houses in the second semester of 2015 and 29.3\% in the second
   semester of 2016. The factors directly associated with housing
   infestation by Aedes were the house condition score (adjusted odds ratio
   {[}aOR]: 1.64; 95\% CI: 1.40-1.91) and the previous record of housing
   infestation (aOR: 2.99; 95\% CI: 2.00-4.48). Moreover, the breeding-site
   elimination done by house residents reduced the housing infestation odds
   by 81\% (95\% CI: 25-95\%). These factors were independent of the
   seasonal and cyclical variations of the vector. In conclusion, our
   findings could help to focalize antivectorial interventions in
   dengue-endemic regions with similar demographic and socioeconomic
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the efficacy of high-volume spraying with the
   adulticide a-cypermethrin alone and in combination with the larvicide
   diflubenzuron on the density of sand flies in gardens of three detached
   households in periurban areas in southeast Spain. Treatments were
   applied four times between June and August 2016, and four nearby sites,
   two households and two non-urbanized sites, were untreated controls. The
   number of sand flies collected between May and October 2016 using sticky
   interception and light attraction traps, was 4446 specimens. Species
   identified morphologically included Sergentomyia minuta (n = 2101;
   48\%), Phlebotomus perniciosus (n = 1922; 44\%), Phlebotomus papatasi (n
   = 173; 4\%), Phlebotomus sergenti (n = 161; 4\%) and Phlebotomus ariasi
   (n = 36; 1\%). Sand flies were detected in both treated and untreated
   sites. The proportion of positive sticky traps and the median (range)
   density of sand flies in positive traps were 61\% traps and 7 (2-172)
   sand flies/m(2)/day in untreated sites, and 43\% traps and 4 (1-56) sand
   flies/m(2)/day in treated sites (p < 0.05). Similarly, for light traps,
   it was 96\% traps and 30 (3-168) flies/trap/day, and 83\% traps and 3
   (1-12) sand flies/trap/day, respectively (p < 0.05). However, sand fly
   density followed a comparable seasonal pattern in untreated and treated
   sites and did not consistently decrease following insecticide
   applications. These results were confirmed with mixed negative binomial
   modelling of sand fly density adjusted for time since application,
   month, environmental setting and site. The limited efficacy of the
   treatments, added to their cost, the impact of insecticides on
   non-target organisms and human health, and the risk of development of
   insecticide resistance, should dissuade similar outdoor applications to
   control sand fly vector populations in residential areas.},

Title = {Facets of the nesting ecology of a ground-nesting bird, the Spotted
   Thick-knee, in an urban mosaic landscape},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Ground-nesting bird species are typically threatened when their natural
   habitats are removed or altered through urbanisation. Despite this, some
   species, like the Spotted Thick-knee (Burhinus capensis), persist in
   urban mosaic landscapes. Our study was undertaken to collect novel
   information on Spotted Thick-knee persistence in an urban mosaic
   landscape by investigating facets of its nesting ecology in
   Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. We collected Spotted Thick-knee nesting
   and nest site data between July 2019 and December 2020. We conducted
   direct observations at 33 nest sites, and additional remote monitoring
   with camera traps at eight nest sites. Spotted Thick-knee breeding pairs
   showed select habitat and nest-site preferences (greater use of
   shrublike species for nest-site placement, more grass cover, shorter
   grass, and flatter slopes at nest sites) compared with random sites.
   Successful nesting outcomes were significantly greater than failed
   nesting outcomes. Incubation activity was significantly longer during
   the day, and incubation activity had a significant adverse relationship
   with disturbance in human-modified habitats. Land use and human activity
   influenced nest-site selection and survival of nests. Spotted Thick-knee
   used residential gardens and recreational areas as nest sites in the
   urban mosaic, although nests were more successful in residential
   gardens. They used shrub-like vegetation as nest-cover structures,
   possibly because of added protection from extreme weather or less visual
   detection. Risks associated with nesting in human-modified habitats
   included increased threats from domestic animals and incubation activity
   costs because of disturbance around nest sites. There are relatively few
   studies on ground-nesting birds in urban areas, so further research is
   needed to determine how our results compare with other species.},

Abstract = {Green areas in urban environments, such as urban parks and urban

   cities. As the biodiversity of an area is an indication of its quality,
   soundecological indicators have been used to assess the biodiversity in
   natural areas. Due to the presence of anthropogenic sounds in urban
   areas, the use of these indicators to determine the quality of urban
   areas can be questioned. However, the vocal activity of collectively
   singing birds during the dawn chorus contributes to the urban
   soundscape, and results in a prominent biophonic component of this
   soundscape, as can be clearly seen in its yearly pattern. The use of
   soundecological indicators through the estimation of the Bird Dawn
   Chorus Strength has the potential to provide a means of assessing the
   quality of urban green spaces. To demonstrate this potential, a pilot
   study is presented here on the annual temporal scale of the soundscape

Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The ratio of green areas belonging to residential areas and their
   location in the city is too important to ignore. However, when we look
   at urban planning, it is seen that green areas belonging to common
   public areas are generally evaluated within the scope of ecosystem
   services, while residential gardens that are within the scope of private
   property are ignored. In this context, the main purpose of the study is
   to examine the contribution of the residential gardens, in which the
   landscape value is kept to the forefront, to the ecosystem services.
   Within the scope of this main purpose, this study analyzes how the green
   areas of the residential gardens in Trabzon can be designed through a
   focus on green infrastructure (GI) within the axis of landscape value
   and how these designs will serve the ecosystem services in this
   perspective. Following the study, it has been determined that both
   spatial needs and ecosystem benefits can be met with the same GI
   elements, while, on the other hand, it has been conferred that the
   landscape value, as a significant factor in the design of residential
   gardens, is supported by several GI elements of an edible garden,
   pollinator garden, rain garden, biological pond, and green roof. It has
   been determined that GI elements, where vegetation and water landscape
   elements are used together, have a higher potential for ecosystem
   services. In addition, it has been concluded that the green areas of the
   residential gardens should not be planned and designed solely within
   their own areas. Based on these analyses, it has been determined that
   the benefits are considerably increased when the green areas of the
   residential gardens are planned and designed through a holistic
   GI-oriented design approach based on the total building parcel. Thus, it
   is very important to consider GI systems with a holistic approach in
   residential gardens throughout the city. This holistic approach will
   allow the benefits of GI to be spread throughout the city and will
   ensure that the benefits are homogenized within the city.},

Title = {Opening the black box of bird-window collisions: passive video
   recordings in a residential backyard},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Collisions with windows on buildings are a major source of bird
   mortality. The current understanding of daytime collisions is limited by
   a lack of empirical data on how collisions occur in the real world
   because most data are collected by recording evidence of mortality
   rather than pre-collision behaviour. Based on published literature
   suggesting a causal relationship between bird collision risk and the
   appearance of reflections on glass, the fact that reflections vary in
   appearance depending on viewing angle, and general principles of object
   collision kinematics, we hypothesized that the risk and lethality of
   window collisions may be related to the angle and velocity of birds'
   flight. We deployed a home security camera system to passively record
   interactions between common North American bird species and residential
   windows in a backyard setting over spring, summer and fall seasons over
   2 years. We captured 38 events including 29 collisions and nine
   near-misses in which birds approached the glass but avoided impact. Only
   two of the collisions resulted in immediate fatality, while 23 birds
   flew away immediately following impact. Birds approached the glass at
   variable flight speeds and from a wide range of angles, suggesting that
   the dynamic appearance of reflections on glass at different times of day
   may play a causal role in collision risk. Birds that approached the
   window at higher velocity were more likely to be immediately killed or
   stunned. Most collisions were not detected by the building occupants
   and, given that most birds flew away immediately, carcass surveys would
   only document a small fraction of window collisions. We discuss the
   implications of characterizing pre-collision behaviour for designing
   effective collision prevention methods.},

   greenspace types; however, rodents were detected least in residential
   gardens, possums were detected most often in forest fragments, and
   hedgehogs least in forest fragments. Proximity of amenity parks to
   forest patches was positively associated with possum and hedgehog
   presence and negatively with rats. Conversely, proximity of residential
   gardens to forest patches was positively associated with rat presence.
   Management of rats should focus on sites with shrub and lower canopy
   cover and of mice on sites with herb layer cover, while micro-habitat
   features were not important for hedgehogs and possums. Rats were most
   likely to be found in residential gardens with compost heaps. The wide
   distributions of these species suggest that in order to be successful,
   ecological restoration must be coordinated, target all green space
   types, and engage urban residents. A barrier to successful ecological
   restoration of urban green spaces in many cities is invasive mammalian
   predators. We determined the fine- and landscape-scale habitat
   characteristics associated with the presence of five urban predators
   (black and brown rats, European hedgehogs, house mice, and brushtail
   possums) in three New Zealand cities, in spring and autumn, in three
   green space types: forest fragments, amenity parks, and residential
   gardens. Season contributed to variations in detections for all five
   taxa. Rodents were detected least in residential gardens; mice were
   detected more often in amenity parks. Hedgehogs were detected least in
   forest fragments. Possums were detected most often in forest fragments
   and least often in residential gardens. Some of this variation was
   explained by our models. Proximity of amenity parks to forest patches
   was strongly associated with presence of possums (positively), hedgehogs
   (positively), and rats (negatively). Conversely, proximity of
   residential gardens to forest patches was positively associated with rat
   presence. Rats were associated with shrub and lower canopy cover and
   mice with herb layer cover. In residential gardens, rat detection was
   associated with compost heaps. Successful restoration of biodiversity in
   these cities needs extensive, coordinated predator control programmes
   that engage urban residents.},

Abstract = {The integration of life-history, physiological and behavioural traits
   into the pace-of-life generates a powerful framework to understand trait
   variation in nature both along environmental gradients and in response
   to environmental stressors. While the gut microbiome has been
   hypothesized as a candidate mechanism to underlie differentiation in the
   pace-of-life, this has been rarely studied. We investigated the role of
   the gut microbiome in contributing to the differentiation in pace-
   of-life and in thermal adaptation between populations of Ischnura
   elegans damselfly larvae inhabiting warmer low latitudes and colder high
   latitudes. We carried out a common-garden experiment, whereby we
   manipulated the exposure of the damselfly larvae to two key global
   warming factors: 4 degrees C warming and a 30 degrees C heat wave.
   Comparing the bacterial composition of the food source and the
   bacterioplankton indicated that damselfly larvae differentially take up
   bacteria from the surrounding environment and have a resident and
   functionally relevant microbiome. The gut microbiome differed between
   larvae of both latitudes, and this was associated with the host's
   latitudinal differentiation in activity, a key pace-of-life trait. Under
   heat wave exposure, the gut microbial community composition of
   high-latitude larvae converged towards that of the low-latitude larvae,
   with an increase in bacteria that likely are important in providing
   energy to cope with the heat wave. This suggests an adaptive
   latitude-specific shift in the gut microbiota matching the better
   ability of low-latitude hosts to deal with heat extremes. In general,
   our study provides evidence for the gut microbiome contributing to
   latitudinal differentiation in both the pace-of-life and in heat
   adaptation in natural populations.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-79},

Abstract = {Given that rates of urbanization are rising globally, the need to
   maintain and enhance urban biodiversity has become important. This study
   examines the relative influence of different land-use types as well as
   environmental resources (trees, flowering trees, fruiting trees, shrubs,
   telecommunication mast, pylons, electric poles, buildings) on bird
   diversity indicators in a rapidly developing urban settlement in Ghana.
   Remote sensing was used to estimate the extent of conversion of natural
   habitats into urban settlements. Using point count surveys, bird species
   were recorded and compared in randomly selected plots of four land-use
   types of farmlands, remnant forest, residential and commercial areas. We
   further evaluated the relative influence of habitat resources on bird
   diversity indicators. We found a significant expansion of built-up areas
   into natural habitats in the study area. Also, there has been a
   significant increase in sparse vegetation coupled with a drop in the
   area covered by dense vegetation over the last three decades. Avifauna
   diversity indicators differ significantly across the four land-use types
   with urban farmlands being the most species diverse, followed by urban
   remnant forests, then residential and finally commercial areas. Our
   findings suggest that avian species diversity indicators decreased
   significantly with increasing land-use intensity and revealed that the
   study area still possesses significant conservation potentials for urban
   birds and by extension biological diversity as long as vegetation
   fragments are maintained within a sustained urban expansion framework.
   We propose increasing the quantity and complexity of the vegetation
   cover in residential areas by supporting citizens to establish private
   yards to increase the city's green network.},

Abstract = {Bipartite networks of flowering plants and their visitors (potential
   pollinators) are increasingly being used in studies of the structure and
   function of these ecological interactions. Whilst they hold much promise
   in understanding the ecology of plant-pollinator networks and how this
   may be altered by environmental perturbations, like land-use change and
   invasive species, there is no consensus about the scale at which such
   networks should be constructed and analysed. Ecologists, however, have
   emphasised that many processes are scale dependent. Here, we compare
   network- and species-level properties of ecological networks analysed at
   the level of a site, pooling across sites within a given habitat for
   each month of surveys, and pooling across all sites and months to create
   a single network per habitat type. We additionally considered how these
   three scales of resolution influenced conclusions regarding differences
   between networks according to two contrasting habitat types (urban
   bushland remnants and residential gardens) and the influence of honey
   bee abundance on network properties. We found that most network
   properties varied markedly depending on the scale of analysis, as did
   the significance, or lack thereof, of habitat type and honey bee
   abundance on network properties. We caution against pooling across sites
   and months as this can create unrealistic links, invalidating
   conclusions on network structure. In conclusion, consideration of scale
   of analysis is also important when conducting and interpreting
   plant-pollinator networks.},

   environmental predictors for the two bird groups assemblages in Depok,
   one of Jakarta's satellite cities. We used the point-count method to
   survey the birds in three habitat types, green spaces, residentials, and
   roadside, and then we used Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) to analyze the

   Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) and cave swiflets (Collocalia

   average, canopy cover was most extensive in green spaces followed by

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {227},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Both residential areas and urban forest fragments can provide stopover
   habitat for migrating birds. However, it is not clear which migrant
   species use urban forest fragments versus residential areas. Objectives
   for this study were to determine: (1) which species primarily use urban
   forest fragments versus adjacent residential areas during migration; (2)
   whether birds in different vertical strata guilds (canopy and under
   canopy) are associated with urban forest fragments versus residential
   areas, and which vegetation characteristics are important for certain
   species that preferentially utilize one habitat over the other.
   Conducted in Gainesville, Florida, 39 random point counts were situated
   in urban forest fragments, adjacent residential areas, and
   forest-residential edges during spring and fall migration. We recorded
   44 migrant species across all point counts. Ten (38\%) under-canopy
   birds significantly preferred urban forest fragments compared to
   residential neighborhoods. Canopy birds typically used forest fragments
   and residential areas more equally, with only one species showing
   significant preference for the residential habitat. Residential
   neighborhoods that retain vertical vegetation structure were more likely
   to have more species of birds. These results show the importance of
   conserving and restoring certain vegetative characteristics in urban
   ecosystems: preserving large trees in residential neighborhoods,
   retaining small forest remnant patches throughout the urban matrix, and
   increasing vertical vegetation structure in yards. These practices will
   help provide avian habitat during migration, increasing avian diversity
   in urban areas.},

Abstract = {Landscape composition and its related functional agrobiodiversity (FAB)
   was severely simplified during the last decades. As landscape
   composition is expected to influence the interrelated microclimate and
   arthropod community at different scales, this simplification might have
   led to a decline in multiple agro-ecosystem services, with potential
   impacts for the growth of crops with different demands from the
   environment. To study landscape-scale effects on multicrop yield and
   herbivory in combination with its potential drivers, including
   functional arthropod community and microclimate, we used standardised 1
   m(2) mini-gardens planted with ten different vegetable crops as
   phytometers. The gardens were installed at locations varying in
   surrounding landscape composition and the vegetables were selected to
   have contrasting requirements in terms of growing conditions,
   pollination services and susceptibility to pests. Monitoring of the
   mini-gardens was performed in 2018 and 2019 in Flanders (Belgium). We
   found no relationship between landscape composition in a 500 m radius
   and crop yield. Considering possible mechanisms, we found that an
   increasing share of woody vegetation (>3 m high) in the surrounding
   landscape is important to buffer the temperature and soil moisture
   variation in the mini-gardens. The share of agricultural land use and
   urban green (<3 m high) is, respectively, positively and negatively
   related with the activity-density of natural enemies and pollinators.
   The growth of different crops responded differently to higher
   temperature ranges and we found no relation between natural enemies and
   herbivory. In conclusion, these abiotic and biotic pathways did not
   cause an overall relationship between landscape composition and yield.
   Synthesis and applications. These outcomes indicate that woody
   vegetation in the rural landscape buffers soil moisture and temperature
   variation, which will become even more important due to climate change.
   Furthermore, pollinators and natural enemies were most active in rural
   environments and less active in areas with residential green and
   built-up surfaces. Local, flower rich habitat, such as road sides, can
   further support natural enemies and buffer soil moisture variation. Yet,
   high arthropod activity is no assurance for arthropod mediated ecosystem
   service delivery nor is microclimate buffering an assurance for higher
   crop yields.},

Title = {The effectiveness of a biopesticide in the reduction of coffee berry
   borers in coffee plants},
Journal = {CROP PROTECTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {161},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Context: Crop pest outbreaks are expected to become more frequent and
   unpredictable due to climate change, posing risks to ecosystem health
   and farmers' livelihoods. At the same time, there is growing evidence
   that chemical pesticides can persist in the landscape and contribute to
   land degradation. The use of natural pesticides in place of chemical
   pesticides is hoped to manage pest outbreaks while also restoring
   pollinator populations and improving the quality of arable land. During
   the 1970s, many countries committed to promoting and legislating
   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies (encouraging natural and
   holistic approaches to pest management), often including using natural
   pesticides, known as biopesticides.Objective: We assessed the
   effectiveness of a biopesticide on coffee berry borer (CBB; Hypothenemus
   hampei) presence in 57 small-holder coffee home gardens in West Java,
   Indonesia across three years.Methods: Prior to the application of the
   biopesticide, we randomly chose ten coffee plants from each field and
   recorded the proportion of healthy berries per plant (berries without
   pest infestation) as a control. In April 2020, we distributed the
   biopesticide in each of the 57 coffee home gardens and repeated the
   above experiment. The biopesticide was redistributed in October 2020 and
   April 2021. We repeated the experiment for the last time in April
   2021.Results and conclusions: We found that CBB presence significantly
   decreased, with an inverse relationship between distance to natural
   forest and CBB presence and a positive relationship between shade cover
   and CBB presence. We also interviewed farmers in April 2021 to
   investigate their perception of the effectiveness of the biopesticide
   and 87\% of farmers thought it was more effective than conventional
   pesticides.Significance: We contribute to the growing literature on the
   effectiveness of natural pesticides through assessing farmers'
   perceptions of these methods and providing empirical evidence for their
   effectiveness in remedying CBB infestation. We hope that this study will
   empower farmers to make conscious land-use choices and provide
   government authorities with evidence to support increased accessibility
   to biopesticides.},

Abstract = {At the start of the 21st century, a coastal residential-estate marina
   was developed on a previously degraded and polluted brownfield island
   site within Knysna estuarine bay, Garden Route National Park, South
   Africa, including the creation of 25 ha of new flow-through tidal
   canals. Canals near the larger entrance to this system now support
   permanently submerged beds of seagrass, which in turn support abundant
   macrobenthic invertebrates. In comparison with equivalent
   seagrass-associated assemblages present in natural channels around the
   island, those in the artificial marina canals were similarly structured
   and dominated by the same species, but the marina assemblages were
   significantly more species-rich (1.4 x on average) and were more
   abundant. Indeed, this area of marina supports the richest
   seagrass-associated macrofaunal biodiversity yet recorded from South
   Africa. The canals created de novo therefore now form a valuable
   addition to the bay's marine habitat, in marked contrast to the
   generality that marinas developed on greenfield sites represent a net
   reduction in intertidal and shallow marine area and associated
   seagrass-associated benthos. If located and constructed appropriately,
   brownfield marina development and conservation of coastal marine
   biodiversity clearly need not be antithetical, and brownfield sites may
   provide opportunity for the location and management of `artificial
   marine micro-reserves' or for the action of `other effective area-based
   conservation measures' for soft-sediment faunas.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary: The Blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) is a
   charismatic and easily recognized species. In Brazil, this macaw is
   strongly linked to a key habitat, the Cerrado biome, which is a
   predominantly dry forest savanna. Ara ararauna occurs and breeds in the
   city of Rondonopolis, a medium-sized city located in Mato Grosso, in the
   Central-West Region of Brazil. Rondonopolis was, until recently,
   surrounded by Cerrado habitat. That Cerrado habitat is now greatly
   threatened by agriculture and forest loss. Blue-and-yellow macaw pairs
   nest in the tops of dead palm trees, but as the macaws are nest-site
   limited and suitable nest sites are becoming scarce due to habitat loss,
   their range is shrinking. Blue-and-yellow macaws do not typically nest
   in urban areas, but in Rondonopolis, 11 pairs nest in dead palm trees,
   typically planted on road verges. However, as suitable dead trees are
   very scarce in urban areas, we are investigating whether the
   installation of artificial nest sites in domestic backyards could help
   that urban population thrive, with benefits to the species, and also as
   an encouragement to help local people engage with biodiversity loss. As
   a first step, we asked if local people would be willing to engage with
   conservation efforts and support macaw conservation in the city. To
   accomplish this, we surveyed the attitudes of Rondonopolis residents to
   measure: (1) citizens' preferences among the bird species that occur in
   the city; (2) the average area of their yards, and (3) the willingness
   of residents to: (a) plant fruit trees to attract macaws to their yards
   and (b) to install artificial nests in their yards. Overall, people were
   able to identify half of our sample of local bird species, and almost
   half had seen a nest site. Large, colorful species (macaws, toucan) were
   much more popular. The great majority would be willing to plant fruit
   trees (78\%) and provide nest sites (70\%) for macaws. This willingness
   to engage was not affected by socioeconomic differences, suggesting
   widespread support for this charismatic species. The Blue-and-yellow
   macaw (Ara ararauna) is a charismatic and easily recognized species.
   While they are classified as being of ``least concern{''} in the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, their
   populations are declining. In Brazil, the accelerated destruction of one
   of its key habitats, the Cerrado biome, is a principal cause of their
   decreasing abundance. As with other species affected by loss of the
   Cerrado, active conservation measures are required. While usually rare
   in urban ecosystems, Ara ararauna occurs and breeds in small numbers in
   the city of Rondonopolis, a medium-sized city located in Mato Grosso,
   Central-West Region of Brazil. Blue-and-yellow macaw pairs nest in the
   tops of dead palm trees, but as the macaws are nest-site limited and
   suitable dead trees are scarce in urban areas, the installation of
   artificial nest sites in domestic backyards could help that urban
   population to thrive. To investigate whether local people would be
   willing to engage with conservation efforts and in particular to support
   macaw conservation, we surveyed the attitudes of Rondonopolis residents
   to measure: (1) citizens' preferences among the bird species that occur
   in the city; (2) the average area of their yards, and (3) the
   willingness of residents to: (a) plant fruit trees to attract macaws to
   their yards and (b) to install artificial nests in their yards.
   Larger and more colorful birds (Ara ararauna, the Red-and-green macaw
   Ara chloropterus and Toco Toucan Ramphastos toco) were the bird species
   most valued across all socio-economic groups, suggesting that the
   charismatic species would be more likely to be supported by urbanites.
   Overall, people had good biodiversity knowledge, with respondents being
   able to identify half of our sample of local bird species, on average,
   and almost half had seen a nest site. The great majority were willing to
   plant fruit trees (78\%) and provide nest sites (70\%) for macaws. This
   willingness to engage was not affected by socioeconomic differences.
   These data indicate that a municipal macaw conservation program could be
   successful in Rondonopolis, and we argue that macaws could be a flagship
   species which would benefit wider efforts to engage Brazilian urbanites
   in active engagement with nature.},

Abstract = {We investigated seed dispersal phenology of bird-dispersed and
   encroaching woody species in the Free State National Botanical Garden
   (FSNBG), South Africa, over a 12-month period. Results from defecated
   seeds' collection in 17 roosting sites show that a total of 22,161 seeds
   belonging to 14 woody species under 11 families were eaten and dispersed
   by foraging birds with seeds of six species being frequently dispersed.
   The native species had a larger number of dispersed bird-ingested seeds
   than the alien and invasive species. Seeds' collection suggested that
   out of five fruiting species, birds mostly preferred the red (Ziziphus
   mucronata, Ehretia rigida and Viscum rotundifolium) and black fruits
   (Olea europaea subsp. africana and Diospyros lyciodes). Ziziphus
   mucronata and O. subsp. africana seeds were dispersed in significantly
   higher numbers between March and July (mean +/- SE: 47.1 +/- 11.6; 51.4
   +/- 9.0), while Searsia lancea and E. rigida were mostly dispersed
   between August and December (221.6 +/- 74.1; 373.6 +/- 91.5)-a dichotomy
   that could minimise competition for dispersal agents while sustaining
   the resident bird species. Over 480 h of camera trapping, 22 bird
   species were captured, of which seven displayed high foraging frequency,
   and were resident in behaviour, while six species were migratory and
   colonial avian frugivores, including two alien bird species. We conclude
   that the reported bush encroachment is a likely result of high propagule
   pressure by resident frugivorous birds and colonial wintering birds in
   FSNBG, together with low fruit diversity in the grassland habitat.},

Title = {Population-specific association of Clock gene polymorphism with
   annual cycle timing in stonechats},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 13},
Abstract = {Timing is essential for survival and reproduction of organisms across
   the tree of life. The core circadian clock gene Clk is involved in the
   regulation of annual timing events and shows highly conserved sequence
   homology across vertebrates except for one variable region of
   poly-glutamine repeats. Clk genotype varies in some species with
   latitude, seasonal timing and migration. However, findings are
   inconsistent, difficult to disentangle from environmental responses, and
   biased towards high latitudes. Here we combine field data with a
   common-garden experiment to study associations of Clk polymorphism with
   latitude, migration and annual-cycle timing within the stonechat species
   complex across its trans-equatorial distribution range. Our dataset
   includes 950 records from 717 individuals from nine populations with
   diverse migratory strategies. Gene diversity was lowest in resident
   African and Canary Island populations and increased with latitude,
   independently of migration distance. Repeat length and annual-cycle
   timing was linked in a population-specific way. Specifically, equatorial
   African stonechats showed delayed timing with longer repeat length for
   all annual-cycle stages. Our data suggest that at low latitudes with
   nearly constant photoperiod, Clk genotype might orchestrate a range of
   consistent, individual chronotypes. In contrast, the influence of Clk on
   annual-cycle timing at higher latitudes might be mediated by its
   interactions with genes involved in (circadian) photoperiodic pathways.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The importance of natural environments in supporting health and
   wellbeing has been well evidenced in supporting positive mental and
   physical health outcomes, including during periods of crisis and stress.
   Given the disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been
   greatest for those who are most vulnerable, understanding the role of
   natural environment and alternative forms of nature engagement in
   supporting health and wellbeing for vulnerable groups is important. This
   study explored how nature engagement supported health and wellbeing in
   those with a pre-existing health condition during the first UK lockdown.
   Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 adults with a
   pre-existing health condition and analysed using Interpretative
   Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Four themes were identified: COVID-19
   versus nature; Nature as an extension and replacement; Nature
   connectedness; and Therapeutic nature. The findings show the importance
   of nature in supporting health and wellbeing in those with a
   pre-existing health condition through engagement with private and public
   natural environments, micro-restorative opportunities, nature connection
   as an important pathway, and the therapeutic benefits of nature
   engagement. The present research extends the evidence-base beyond
   patterns of nature engagement to a deeper understanding of how those
   with existing health conditions perceived and interacted with nature in
   relation to their health and wellbeing during the first UK lockdown.
   Findings are discussed in relation to health supporting environments,
   micro-restorative opportunities, and policy implications.},

Journal = {TOXICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The exposure of operators, workers, residents and bystanders to
   pesticides is of high potential concern. Yet, reports on pesticide
   residues in the environment and near treated fields often spark debates
   if such findings might indicate a health risk. Although the underlying
   models are considered conservative, there are only limited field data on
   systemic exposure available. As a first step to improve the situation,
   we conducted a scoping review of state-of-the-art pesticide exposure
   biomonitoring studies in operators, workers, residents or bystanders. In
   contrast to existing reviews, we focused on target cultures of potential
   high pesticide exposure such as tree-grown produce, vine or hops. The
   search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. Out of 17
   eligible articles, a total of 11 studies met our search criteria, and 6
   of them quantified the systemic exposure of humans. The analysis
   revealed that exposure was mainly driven by application of pesticides
   and reentry work, resulting in a higher exposure of operators and
   workers than of residents and bystanders. In nearly all cases, the
   systemic exposure was below the relevant toxicological reference values.
   The studies were subsequently analyzed to identify key criteria for a
   reliable design of a biomonitoring study on pesticide exposure.},

Abstract = {Live bird markets (LBMs) provide integral hubs for 95\% of poultry
   produced for food. Surveillance systems in LBMs serving smallholder
   farmers in sub-saharan Africa are often non-functional, and data about
   public health risks and emerging pathogens are lacking. Studies in Kenya
   have reported 29-44\% Campylobacter prevalence in poultry. We analysed
   such LBMs in Kenya for likely transmission of Campylobacter from poultry
   to humans. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 186 live poultry
   traders (LPTs) in 14 LBMs in a region with widespread backyard poultry
   systems. A pretested structured questionnaire was administered to all
   LPTs having regular contacts with poultry to gather market data and risk
   information on campylobacteriosis. Campylobacter was detected in
   individual cloacal cultures and identified through PCR. The median score
   obtained from the outcome of risk assessment dichotomized respondents
   into high and low risk categories. We performed logistic regression at
   95\% confidence interval (CI) to compare market characteristics and
   Campylobacter positivity to risk categories to identify LBM-associated
   public health risks. Markets had a median of 13 traders, and mean age of
   46.3 +/- 13.7 years. Majority 162/186 (87.1\%) were males. Market
   behavioural processes by LPTs varied: Only 58.6\% LPTs held bird species
   separate; onsite slaughter (38.7\%); encountered sick-bird (93\%) and
   dead-bird (83\%) amidst limited health inspection (31.2\%).
   Campylobacter positivity in live birds was 43/112 (38.4\%, 95\% CI:
   29.4-48.1). Risk information on campylobacteriosis was low 41/114 (36\%,
   95\% CI: 27.2-45.5). Sanitary risks were related to accumulation of
   litter (adjusted prevalence odds ratio {[}aPOR]: 19.67, 95\% CI:
   3.01-128.52). Accessing hand-wash facilities (aPOR: .32, 95\% CI:
   .13-.78) and access to information (aPOR: .24, 95\% CI: .09-.61) were
   protective. Sanitary risks were related to poor hygiene. LBMs could be
   central surveillance sites for Campylobacter. Public health
   authorities/actors should consider appropriate targeting to improve
   sanitary measures and Campylobacter control strategies.},

Abstract = {The poultry sector is large and expanding in the global South, playing a
   central role in providing increased protein to a rapidly growing base of
   consumers. The sector includes small backyard farms, small commercial
   operations, and very large, complex enterprises. Although there is
   substantial literature on climate adaptation by crop farmers and large
   livestock farmers, such information is limited for poultry. This study
   focuses on the effects of higher temperatures on commercial poultry
   farms in southwest Nigeria and their adaptation strategies. We use a
   rich set of in-depth interviews to describe how poultry farmers are
   adapting to higher temperatures and their reasons for adopting
   particular practices. In general, interviewees are aware that
   temperatures have increased over time and that heat stress reduces
   poultry productivity in terms of weight gain and laying capacity. They
   are knowledgeable and are not passively enduring the adverse effects of
   higher temperatures as they have adopted a range of adaptation
   practices. This study identified three main adaptation strategies: (i)
   keeping drinking water cool, (ii) keeping the building cool and
   increasing ventilation, and (iii) giving birds medicines and supplements
   that help them cope with increased heat. Small farms tend to adopt
   simple and low-cost practices, and large farms tend to adopt more
   sophisticated and expensive approaches, in line with the nature of their
   respective operations. The paper's findings can help address gaps in
   strategies aiming to help this critically important sector of the food
   system be robust to future environmental change.},

Title = {Entomophagy practices in Bodoland Territorial Region, Assam: nutritional
   potential and implications for food security},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INSECTS AS FOOD AND FEED},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1485-1500},
Abstract = {Insects as food have been consumed all over the world, mostly by ethnic
   communities, since time immemorial. With the ever-increasing human
   population causing an imbalance between food production and nutrition,
   edible insects are gaining importance as an alternative food source. The
   aim of this paper is to record the region-specific current practices of
   entomophagy and their implications in food security. The study involved
   field investigation to find out the pattern of entomophagy among the
   scheduled tribes of the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR), Assam.
   Following this, we made an effort to estimate the diversity of edible
   insects at different sampling sites in the studied area. Nutritional
   profiling of some of the edible insects was carried out to know their
   potential as a measure of food security. A total of 25 edible insects
   belonging to 9 orders and 18 families were recorded during the study
   period. Species diversity was recorded highest in forest/backyard forest
   habitat followed by agricultural field habitat, open field habitat and
   swampy area habitat in all the four districts in BTR, Assam. During the
   consumer survey, a total of 4,051 people belonging to four different
   scheduled tribes, Bodo, Rabha, Garo and Sarania were interviewed and out
   of them, 3,840 (94.79\%) people were found to consume insects as food.
   The insects are mostly consumed in fried form, followed by smoked, raw,
   paste, roasted and curry form. The biochemical analysis of nutrient
   contents of 11 commonly consumed edible insects showed that they are a
   rich source of protein, vitamins and micronutrients with a reasonable
   amount of carbohydrates and lipids with higher radical scavenging
   activity. To manage insects in the context of food security, increased
   attention should be given to sustainable collection and successful
   farming of edible insects for the creation of export potential, giving
   emphasis on the nutritional advantages.},

Title = {Urban native vegetation remnants support more diverse native bee
   communities than residential gardens in Australia's southwest
   biodiversity hotspot},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {265},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Native bees are declining in many regions, often associated with loss of
   natural habitat. Urbanisation replaces natural vegetation with a
   highly-modified landscape, where residential gardens are a major
   component of urban greenspace. While many cities retain native
   vegetation remnants within the urban matrix, these are often small,
   isolated and degraded. However, there is little empirical evidence on
   the capacity of residential gardens to provide equivalent or beneficial
   habitat for native bees, and which local and landscape factors influence
   bee assemblages. We surveyed bee assemblages in the southwest Australian
   biodiversity hotspot at seven residential gardens and seven bushland
   remnants over two years. We recorded 153 species/morphospecies of native
   bees. Native bees were more abundant in bushland remnants than
   residential gardens. Abundance of the introduced honeybee Apis mellifera
   was generally high, and did not differ between habitats. Bushland
   remnants hosted more species, and rare and unique species, than did
   residential gardens. Native bee body-size and nesting guilds varied in
   their response to habitat type. Native bee abundance and richness
   increased with abundance of native plant species, but decreased with
   total flower species richness. Native bee species richness was
   negatively impacted by urbanisation (built space and isolation from
   bushland reserves). There were no significant relationships between
   honeybee abundance and local and landscape factors. Our study
   demonstrates that while residential gardens can host native bees, urban
   bushland remnants harbour a more comprehensive suite of species and are
   key for the conservation of native bee populations.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study was to determined environmental prices
   and energy efficiency for mandarin (Citrus reticulata) production in
   Hatay province of Turkey. This study was performed for 2019 production
   season in Arsuz, Erzin, Dortyol and Samandag towns in Hatay province of
   Turkey. The data provided from study were collected from 78 different
   mandarin productioner by using a face to face questionnaire method.
   Environmental prices were calculated depent with greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emission of agricultural inputs. Also, the agricultural input values,
   input energies and output values, output energies used in mandarin
   production were calculated to detetthine the energy efficiency.
   According to the study findings, the environmental prices in mandarin
   production was calculated as 430.11 ha(-1). Total GHG emission was
   calculated as 7545.87 kgCO(2-q) ha(-1) for mandarin production with the
   greatest portions for electricity usage (39.42\%). The electricity usage
   followed up nitrogen fertilizer (17.67\%), water consumption of
   irrigation (14.49\%), human labour (6.88\%), diesel fuel consumption
   (4.96\%), phosphate fertilizer usage (4.77\%), machine usage (2.66\%),
   fatutyard manure usage (2.64\%), potassium fertilizer usage (2.07\%),
   herbicides usage (1.71\%), fungicides usage (1.60\%) and insecticides
   usage (1.14\%), respectively. Additionally, GHG ratio value was
   calculated as 0.23 kgCO(2-eq) kg(-1). Energy efficiency, specific
   energy, energy productivity and net energy calculations were calculated
   respectively as 0.98, 1.73 MJ kg(-1), 0.58 kg MJ(-1) and -1134.65 MJ
   ha(-1).},

Title = {Local plant richness predicts bee abundance and diversity in a study of
   urban residential yards},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {64-73},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding the drivers of biodiversity in cities is a central goal of
   urban ecology. There is currently intense scientific and public interest
   in the factors that influence pollinator diversity in cities and their
   surroundings. Existing studies point to a variety of landscape and local
   factors as potentially important, including urbanization (often defined
   as impervious surface cover in the surrounding lands), tree canopy cover
   and the diversity and abundance of locally flowering plants. However,
   few studies have sought to weigh the relative importance of these
   predictors of bee community metrics. Using a set of 27 residential yards
   chosen to represent a gradient of both urbanization and tree canopy
   cover at a landscape scale, we used pan trapping and netting to assess
   the abundance and diversity of local bee communities across the City of
   Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Surprisingly, the landscape factors
   (urbanization and tree cover) described only a tiny fraction (< 1\%) of
   the total variance in bee abundance and diversity across sites. This was
   true regardless of the scale of analysis at which the landscape factors
   were measured. Instead, a yard's floral richness, and, to a somewhat
   lesser extent, its floral abundance, emerged as the most important
   predictors of a yard's bee community abundance and diversity. Our study
   offers an important counterpoint to a growing body of work emphasizing
   the impacts of landscape factors on bee communities. Instead, our
   research suggests that improving bee floral resources by increasing the
   plant species richness and abundance locally is a powerful tool to
   support bee conservation, regardless of the level of urbanization or
   tree cover in the surrounding landscape. Our work highlights that the
   practice of promoting `bee-friendly' plantings in private yards,
   currently being undertaken by a number of non-profits around the world,
   can play an important role in restoring and maintaining urban pollinator
   communities. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH on

Abstract = {In South Vietnam, live bird markets (LBMs) are key in the value chain of
   poultry products and spread of avian influenza virus (AIV) although they
   may not be the sole determinant of AIV prevalence. For this reason, a
   risk analysis of AIV prevalence was conducted accounting for all value
   chain factors. A cross-sectional study of poultry flock managers and
   poultry on backyard farms, commercial (high biosecurity) farms, LBMs and
   poultry delivery stations (PDSs) in four districts of Vinh Long province
   was conducted between December 2016 and August 2017. A total of 3597
   swab samples were collected from birds from 101 backyard farms, 50
   commercial farms, 58 sellers in LBMs and 19 traders in PDSs. Swab
   samples were submitted for AIV isolation. At the same time a
   questionnaire was administered to flock managers asking them to provide
   details of their knowledge, attitude and practices related to avian
   influenza. Multiple correspondence analysis and a mixed-effects
   multivariable logistic regression model were developed to identify
   enterprise and flock manager characteristics that increased the risk of
   AIV positivity. A total of 274 birds were positive for AIV isolation,
   returning an estimated true prevalence of 7.6\% {[}95\% confidence
   interval (CI): 6.8\%-8.5\%]. The odds of a bird being AIV positive if it
   was from an LBM or PDS were 45 (95\% CI: 3.4-590) and 25 (95\% CI:
   1.4-460), respectively, times higher to the odds of a bird from a
   commercial poultry farm being AIV positive. The odds of birds being AIV
   positive for respondents with a mixed (uncertain or inconsistent) level
   and a low level of knowledge about AI were 5.0 (95\% CI: 0.20-130) and
   3.5 (95\% CI: 0.2-62), respectively, times higher to the odd of birds
   being positive for respondents with a good knowledge of AI. LBMs and
   PDSs should receive specific emphasis in AI control programs in Vietnam.
   Our findings provide evidence to support the hypothesis that incomplete
   respondent knowledge of AI and AIV spread mechanism were associated with
   an increased risk of AIV positivity. Delivery of education programs
   specifically designed for those in each enterprise will assist in this
   regard. The timing and frequency of delivery of education programs are
   likely to be important if the turnover of those working in LBMs and PDSs
   is high.},

Title = {Climate-adapted, traditional or cottage-garden planting? Public
   perceptions, values and socio-cultural drivers in a designed garden
   setting},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {65},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The global climate crisis precipitates a call to `futureproof' cities by
   introducing resilient climate-adapted urban green infrastructure (UGI).
   Recent UK research has revealed public support for climate-adapted UGI,
   yet there is a lack of research focusing on the values underlying public
   perceptions, particularly in relation to climate change, and the
   socio-cultural factors driving these. This was addressed by asking 249
   people to walk through one of three contrasting areas of planting:
   exotic (climate-adapted); traditional or cottage-garden, within a
   designed garden setting, whilst conducting a self-guided questionnaire
   assessing participants' perceptions of aesthetics, self-reported
   restorative effect, and plant and invertebrate biodiversity.
   Participants' held values in relation to climate change, non-native
   species, and nature-connectedness were also addressed. Findings
   indicated aesthetic preference for climate-adapted planting over the
   other two styles, providing further evidence of cultural acceptance for
   policymakers and land-managers seeking to `futureproof' cities by
   introducing climate-adapted UGI. Planting of a cottage-garden style was
   perceived as the least attractive, but the most restorative.
   Sociocultural characteristics including age, educational qualifications,
   and taking holidays overseas were drivers of perceptions. Professional
   involvement and interest in the environment, landscape, and horticulture
   were identified as drivers of perceptions and values. Values in relation
   to climate change were directly related to participants' educational
   qualifications. This identifies a need to consider novel approaches to
   climate change education to promote wider understanding of the
   implications of climate-change and the potential for climateadapted UGI
   to deliver `futureproofing' benefits for climate-change mitigation and
   human mental wellbeing.},

   and Nestedness in Neotropical Bird Assemblages},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Islands are well-known as particular and vulnerable ecosystems with
   evolutionary histories, environmental characteristics, and original
   communities different from those of continents. On the contrary, urban
   environments are recent, artificial, and structurally similar among
   distant regions. To assess the relative importance of regional and local
   processes on urban biota, we chose two urban environments, i.e., one on
   the mainland and another on an island in the same ecoregion. We asked
   whether the urbanization process affects the avian biodiversity of the
   ISLAND in the same way as in the continent. We defined an urban gradient
   with three levels of building density, namely, patches of native
   vegetation (remnant woodlands in the urban matrix), medium density
   urbanized areas that maintain vegetation along the streets and gardens,
   and residential areas with less vegetation cover and higher building
   density. In each geographical locality, we selected three sites
   (replicates) for each level of the urban gradient and did bird surveys.
   We found two times as many species in the urban landscape of the
   continent (69) as on the island (35), with the analogous richness
   decrease along the gradient in both regions. Species similarity was
   higher between urbanized sites of both regions compared with the
   similarity between woodlands and urbanized sites, showing that urban
   matrix filters similar species of each pool regionally. Individual
   species responded to urban structure in different ways. We found 32\% of
   bird species were urban exploiters, 48\% urban tolerant, and 20\% urban
   avoiders in both regions. However, some species showed different
   frequencies of occurrence on the island and the continent. Species
   turnover contributed more than richness differences to species
   dissimilarity along the urban gradient on the continent. Contrarily, the
   nestedness component (i.e., species being a strict subset of the species
   at a richer site) was higher on the island. We concluded that the
   negative impact of highly urbanized areas on birds was stronger on the
   island than on the continent. Our results may help to assess the
   implications of beta-diversity loss, especially on islands.},

Title = {Uncovering the genetic diversity within the Aedes notoscriptus
   virome and isolation of new viruses from this highly urbanised and

Journal = {VIRUS EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Australian backyard mosquito, Aedes notoscriptus, is a highly
   urbanised pest species that has invaded New Zealand and the USA.
   Importantly, Ae. notoscriptus has been implicated as a vector of Ross
   River virus, a common and arthritogenic arbovirus in Australia, and is a
   laboratory vector of numerous other pathogenic viruses, including West
   Nile, yellow fever, and Zika viruses. To further explore live viruses
   harboured by field populations of Ae. notoscriptus and, more
   specifically, assess the genetic diversity of its virome, we processed
   495 pools, comprising a total of 6,674 female Ae. notoscriptus collected
   across fifteen suburbs in Brisbane, Australia, between January 2018 and
   May 2019. Nine virus isolates were recovered and characterised by
   metagenomic sequencing and phylogenetics. The principal viral family
   represented was Flaviviridae. Known viruses belonging to the genera
   Flavivirus, Orbivirus, Mesonivirus, and Nelorpivirus were identified
   together with two novel virus species, including a divergent
   Thogoto-like orthomyxovirus and an insect-specific flavivirus. Among
   these, we recovered three Stratford virus (STRV) isolates and an isolate
   of Wongorr virus (WGRV), which for these viral species is unprecedented
   for the geographical area of Brisbane. Thus, the documented geographical
   distribution of STRV and WGRV, both known for their respective medical
   and veterinary importance, has now been expanded to include this major
   urban centre. Phylogenies of the remaining five viruses, namely,
   Casuarina, Ngewotan, the novel Thogoto-like virus, and two new
   flavivirus species, suggested they are insect-specific viruses. None of
   these viruses have been previously associated with Ae. notoscriptus or
   been reported in Brisbane. These findings exemplify the rich genetic
   diversity and viral abundance within the Ae. notoscriptus virome and
   further highlight this species as a vector of concern with the potential
   to transmit viruses impacting human or animal health. Considering it is
   a common pest and vector in residential areas and is expanding its
   global distribution, ongoing surveillance, and ecological study of Ae.
   notoscriptus, together with mapping of its virome and phenotypic
   characterisation of isolated viruses, is clearly warranted. Immanently,
   these initiatives are essential for future understanding of both the
   mosquito virome and the evolution of individual viral species.},

Title = {Animal personality drives individual dietary specialisation across
   multiple dimensions in a mammalian herbivore},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2253-2265},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {1. Animal personality influences how individuals perceive and react to
   different stimuli, such as food quality and predation risk, thereby
   shaping foraging behaviour. As a consequence, animal personality is
   predicted to influence the diet and dietary specialisation of
   individuals within a population, but animal personality and dietary
   specialisation have yet to be linked.
   2. Here, we tested whether individual diet and dietary specialisation
   are a function of animal personality, using an arboreal herbivore, the
   common brushtail possum, as a model species. We hypothesised that
   proactive individuals have more diverse foraging opportunities than
   reactive individuals. We therefore predicted that proactive animals
   (more exploratory, bold and more active) would be less specialised, with
   a broader and higher quality diet than their reactive counterparts. We
   quantified the personality traits and dietary niche using proportional
   similarity index and specialisation categories of possums (n = 30) in a
   population flanking native eucalypt woodland and residential gardens in
   suburban Sydney, Australia.
   3. We found that personality traits were related to the breadth and
   quality of the realised diets of individual possums. As predicted,
   proactive individuals had a broad, high-quality diet with less
   individual dietary specialisation than reactive individuals. Highly
   exploratory individuals had a more diverse diet than less exploratory
   individuals, and bold individuals were more likely than shy individuals
   to consume plants on the ground.
   4. Our study demonstrates an important link between animal personality
   and individual dietary specialisation. The finding that the personality
   of individuals is associated with different diet choices within the same
   landscape is fundamentally significant. First, personality as a driver
   of niche partitioning likely reduces within-species competition and
   hence could contribute to adaptive capacity. Second, the strength of
   ecological processes arising from interactions (e.g. predator-prey and
   plant-herbivore interactions) could differ among individuals according
   to their personality traits.
   5. Our findings are also relevant for effectively managing both
   threatened native and invasive species. Management strategies will be
   improved by incorporating knowledge of individual traits and their
   ecological consequences, plus the ecological context of food-and
   fear-scapes.},

   condition across an urban gradient},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Predator fear effects influence reproductive outcomes in many species.
   In non-urban systems, passerines often respond to predator cues by
   reducing parental investment, resulting in smaller and lighter
   nestlings. Since trophic interactions in urban areas are highly altered,
   it is unclear how passerines respond to fear effects in human-altered
   landscapes. Nestlings of passerines in urban areas also tend to be
   smaller and lighter than their rural counterparts and are often exposed
   to high densities of potential predators yet experience lower per capita
   predation-the predation paradox. We suggest fear effects in urban
   habitats could be a significant mechanism influencing nestling condition
   in birds, despite lowered predation rates. We manipulated exposure of
   nesting birds to adult-consuming predator risk in residential yards
   across a gradient of urbanization to determine the relative influence of
   urbanization and fear on nestling condition. We found nestlings had
   reduced mass in nests exposed to predator playbacks as well as in more
   urban areas. Despite lower per capita predation rates in urban areas,
   fear effects from increased predator densities may influence passerine
   fitness through reduced nestling condition. As urban development
   expands, biodiversity conservation hinges on a deeper mechanistic
   understanding of how urbanization affects reproductive outcomes.},

   unclear. Here, we investigated how honey bee abundance and foraging
   patterns related to those of native bee abundance and diversity in
   residential gardens and native vegetation remnants for 2 years in
   urbanized areas of the Southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot and
   assessed how niche overlap influenced these relationships. Honeybees did
   not overtly suppress native bee abundance; however, complex
   relationships emerged when analysing these relationships according to
   body size, time of day and floral resource levels. Native bee richness
   was positively correlated with overall honeybee abundance in the first
   year, but negatively correlated in the second year, and varied with body
   size. Native bees that had higher resource overlap with honey bees were
   negatively associated with honey bee abundance, and resource overlap
   between honey bees and native bees was higher in residential gardens.
   Relationships with honey bees varied between native bee taxa, reflecting
   adaptations to different flora, plus specialization. Thus, competition
   with introduced bees varies by species and location, mediated by dietary
   breadth and overlap and by other life-history traits of individual bee
   species.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Biodiversity is declining around the world and knowledge
   about biodiversity declines in a similar way. In this study, we
   addressed predictors of species knowledge, i.e., the question of what
   influences or causes species knowledge. The focus was knowledge about
   common bird species in Germany. Data were collected from July to October
   2020 via an online questionnaire, containing demographic data,
   engagement in birdwatching, interest/activity, and images of 28 bird
   species native to Germany. Data were collected from adult students,
   lecturers and administrative staff of the Eberhard Karls University
   Tubingen. Men identified more species than women, garden owners more
   than non-owners. Hometown size had no influence. Employees scored higher
   than students. However, we found that birding specialization was the
   most important predictor, followed by bird-related interest/activity. We
   suggest including such questions in addition to conventional demographic
   questions in the future. Biodiversity is declining, and knowledge about
   biodiversity declines in a similar way. Previous studies have already
   addressed predictors of species knowledge. Here, we studied bird species
   knowledge related to demographics, but also to individual differences in
   affinity to nature, by including (i) birding specialization and (ii)
   bird-related activities/interest. Data were collected from July to
   October 2020 via an online questionnaire, containing demographic data,
   birding specialization, interest/activity, and images of 28 bird species
   native to Germany. Participants were adult students, lecturers and
   administrative staff of the Eberhard Karls University Tubingen. A total
   of 1967 questionnaires were returned in this study (35.3\% male, 53.8\%
   students, 69\% had access to a garden). Mean identification score was
   16.31 +/- 6.38. Thus, participants were able to identify more than half
   of the species (total species n = 28). Men identified more species than
   women, garden owners had higher identification scores than non-owners,
   while hometown size was not significant. A distance to the next forest
   patch >10 km was related to lower identification scores. Employees
   scored higher than students. Correlation between species knowledge and
   birding specialization was high, as was the correlation with bird
   interest/activity. Higher scores were found in older people. In the
   linear univariate model, birding specialization and bird interest were
   the most influential predictors of species knowledge, followed by
   distance to next forest patch and occupation (student vs employees).
   Other variables were not significant. We suggest including such measures
   (interest, attitude, etc.) into further studies and move forward from
   the urban-rural narrative to more complex analyses of living
   circumstances.},

Title = {Impacts of the introduced European honeybee on Australian bee-flower

Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The European honeybee Apis mellifera is a highly successful, abundant
   species and has been introduced into habitats across the globe. As a
   supergeneralist species, the European honeybee has the potential to
   disrupt pollination networks, especially in Australia, whose flora and
   fauna have co-evolved for millions of years. The role of honeybees in
   pollination networks in Australia has been little explored and has never
   been characterised in urban areas, which may favour this exotic species
   due to the proliferation of similarly exotic plant species which this
   hyper-generalist can utilise, unlike many native bee taxa. Here, we use
   a bipartite network approach to compare the roles, in terms of
   species-level properties, of honeybees with native bee taxa in
   bee-flower ('pollination') networks in an urbanised biodiversity
   hotspot. We also assessed whether the abundance of honeybees influences
   overall network structure. Pollination networks were created from
   surveys across seven residential gardens and seven urban native
   vegetation remnants conducted monthly during the spring-summer period
   over two years. There were consistent differences in species-level
   properties between bee taxa, with honeybees often differing from all
   other native bees. Honeybees had significant impacts on network
   properties, being associated with higher nestedness, extinction slopes
   of plants, functional complementarity and niche overlap (year two), as
   well as lower weighted connectance and generalisation. These
   associations all are indicative that competition is occurring between
   the introduced honeybee and the native bee taxa in bee-flower networks.
   In conclusion, the introduced honeybee occupies a dominant, distinct
   position in bee-flower networks in urban habitats in the southwest
   Western Australian biodiversity hotspot and has a major, potentially
   disruptive, influence on plant-pollinator network properties in these
   areas.},

Title = {Garden plants for wild bees-Laypersons' assessment of their suitability
   and opinions on gardening approaches},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {62},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Gardens can support wild bees in otherwise resource-poor environments if
   they provide suitable food plants and nesting sites. Public attitudes
   towards planting for pollinators are currently not well understood and
   little information is available about what laypersons know about
   bee-friendly plants. The present study aimed to fill this knowledge gap
   with the help of photographs of 30 garden plants. Half of these plants
   were suitable food sources (nectar and/or pollen) for wild bees, the
   other half were not. Laypersons' perceptions of the 30 plants and their
   attitudes towards certain types of garden management (bee-friendly or
   not) were investigated. The plants were assigned to five picture sets
   (each set included three suitable and three unsuitable plants), and for
   each set data from 40 persons were collected (n = 200, all adults, 63 \%
   women). Participants considered plants that are suitable for wild bees
   as more suitable than plants that are not. However, an overall mean
   suitability score of 4.9 on the 7-step assessment scale even for the
   unsuitable plants indicated that respondents were not able to clearly
   differentiate between the two types. Most plants were perceived as
   beautiful and desirable, which correlated with attributed bee
   suitability. For this reason, a number of attractive plants that do not
   produce pollen such as Forsythia x intermedia were considered suitable
   for wild bees, while common ivy (Hedera helix), a good provider of
   nectar, but one of the least attractive plants, was not. Participants
   placed importance on bee-friendly, ecological gardening. The support for
   bee-friendly gardening was linked to the number of plants participants
   could correctly identify and to their ecological knowledge. The results
   suggest that while many people would like to improve the suitability of
   their gardens for bees, there is a lack of knowledge about bee-friendly
   species and a need for improved information and communication.},

Abstract = {Urban gardens are important for human well-being, biodiversity and other

   from their owners being aware of the state of biodiversity in their

   assess the motivations and biodiversity knowledge of owners of 33
   domestic gardens in the city of Basel (Switzerland) and related them to
   a survey of native plants and several groups of ground-dwelling
   invertebrates in their gardens. Owners showed different priorities, with
   promotion of habitat for biodiversity, receiving, on average, higher
   scores than cultivation, recreation and garden designing. Owners
   prioritizing biodiversity promotion had gardens with high habitat
   richness. The garden owners' perceptions of both native plant and
   overall invertebrate diversity were not correlated with actual diversity
   data for native plants and ground-dwelling invertebrates. The
   perceptions of the abundance of invertebrate groups by garden owners
   with good biodiversity knowledge were not more accurate than those from
   owners with less knowledge. Despite their willingness, many owners do
   not know all the opportunities to promote biodiversity. Initiatives to
   further biodiversity-friendly gardening should thus transfer knowledge.},

Abstract = {Systena frontalis (F.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is an important pest
   in ornamental plant nurseries in the United States. Information on
   current pest status and management practices employed by nurseries,
   garden centers, and landscape care operations are crucial to developing
   an effective research and extension program for ornamental crops. An
   online survey was developed and administered by the research team in
   2020 to gather data on pest status and current pest management
   practices. The questionnaire included three focus areas: 1) participant
   (location, industry type, or operating area); 2) pest status indicators
   (incidence, affected crops, and estimated loss); and 3) common pest
   management practices. The questionnaire was distributed to stakeholders
   via e-mail lists, newsletters, and blogs. Seventy-five responses were
   received; 82.6\% of which were from wholesale nursery operators in 19
   U.S. states and 1 Canadian province. For most respondents (72\%), damage
   recurred yearly in the past 10 yr and persisted from April to October.
   About 56\% of respondents reported damage on more than five host plant
   species (with Hydrangea spp. being the most frequently identified)
   representing approximately 25\% of the total number of plants grown in
   the facilities. Presence of S. frontalis is being monitored mainly
   through visual inspection of foliage for adult presence or foliage
   damage (100\%), with scouting occurring mainly at weekly intervals
   (57\%). The majority of respondents used broad-spectrum insecticides
   (such as pyrethroids) for adult (89\%) and larval control (47\%). We
   estimated that a grower spends USD\$1,637/ha/yr on insecticides and
   labor for monitoring and implementing S. frontalis management.},

Abstract = {Energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings is one of the
   main scopes of energy studies. These buildings have a high potential for
   saving energy and applying renewable energy technologies. This research
   goal is to explore an energy demand analysis in a commercial birds'
   exhibition building. In the first step, the heating and cooling loads
   are calculated with consideration of the birds' thermal needs. In the
   next step, total electricity demand is determined by visual inspection,
   and a new approach is proposed for saving energy by classifying the
   birds in the studied building. Finally, an optimal combination of
   electricity generation resources, including wind and solar energy
   resources, is designed. The result is compared with the current
   electricity supply (electricity grid) based on economic and
   environmental factors. The results indicate that energy consumption is
   decreased by about 21.49\% based on the introduced approach, while the
   renewable strategy is economically reasonable. This energy-saving caused
   31\% lower NPV for the grid-connected energy supply and 21\% lower NPV
   for the renewable-powered energy supply.},

   2017. We evaluated the effect of Demand CS (pyrethroid adulticide with
   active ingredient lambda-cyhalothrin) and Archer (IGR with active
   ingredient pyriproxyfen) exposure with respect to reproduction (measured
   by fecundity, fertility, and adult emergence) and abundance of
   host-seeking mosquitoes Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae). These
   mosquitoes were collected using BG-Sentinel 2 traps; oviposition
   intensity was monitored using ovitraps for each property involved in the

   table characteristics. Significantly more Ae. albopictus eggs (p < .05)
   were detected in ovitraps located in control lots, whereas no
   significant differences were observed in host-seeking adult abundance of
   Ae. albopictus between treatments. Potential reasons for this finding
   are discussed with respect to oviposition and host-seeking behavior of
   Ae. albopictus. Pyriproxyfen could be a useful control method for some
   populations of Ae. albopictus, especially where resistance to other
   active ingredients or cryptic oviposition sources are present.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Mammographic density (MD), the proportion of
   radiologically dense breast tissue, is a strong risk factor for breast
   cancer. Our objective is to investigate the influence of occupations and
   occupational exposure to physical, chemical, and microbiological agents
   on MD in Spanish premenopausal women.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study based on 1362 premenopausal
   workers, aged 39-50, who attended a gynecological screening in a breast
   radiodiagnosis unit of Madrid City Council. The work history was
   compiled through a personal interview. Exposure to occupational agents
   was evaluated using the Spanish job-exposure matrix MatEmESp. MD
   percentage was assessed using the validated semi-automated computer tool
   DM-Scan. The association between occupation, occupational exposures, and
   MD was quantified using multiple linear regression models, adjusted for
   age, educational level, body mass index, parity, previous breast
   biopsies, family history of breast cancer, energy intake, use of oral
   contraceptives, smoking, and alcohol consumption.
   Results: Although no occupation was statistically significantly
   associated with MD, a borderline significant inverse association was
   mainly observed in orchard, greenhouse, nursery, and garden workers
   (beta = -6.60; 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI) = -14.27; 1.07) and
   information and communication technology technicians (beta = -7.27;
   95\%CI = -15.37; 0.84). On the contrary, a positive association was
   found among technicians in art galleries, museums, and libraries (beta =
   8.47; 95\%CI = -0.65; 17.60). Women occupationally exposed to
   fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides tended to have lower MD. The
   percentage of density decreased by almost 2\% for every 5 years spent in
   occupations exposed to the mentioned agents.
   Conclusions: Although our findings point to a lack of association with
   the occupations and exposures analyzed, this study supports a deeper
   exploration of the role of certain occupational agents in MD, such as
   pesticides.},

Title = {Overview of Native Chicken Breeds in Italy: Conservation Status and
   Rearing Systems in Use},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Simple Summary
   The ongoing loss of domestic animal breeds around the world is occurring
   at an alarming rate. Thus, the registration and preservation of native
   breeds is of great importance. The aim of this study, which forms part
   of a conservation program, was to provide an overview of the
   conservation statuses of native Italian poultry breeds being reared by
   local breeders in Italy. The data collected by means of a census
   questionnaire demonstrate the low population sizes of these breeds in
   Italy and highlight the need for campaigns aimed at publicizing and
   promoting the benefits of native breeds with the goal of increasing
   population sizes. Identifying strategies to facilitate breeders' access
   to pure breed birds is also essential, and would require collaborative
   efforts of university research centers, public entities, and breeders.
   The most reared species of farm animal around the world is the chicken.
   However, the intensification of livestock systems has led to a gradual
   increase in the concentration of a limited number of breeds, resulting
   in substantial erosion to the genetic pool. The initial step of an
   `animal conservation program' entails establishing the actual
   conservation statuses of the breeds concerned in a defined area; in this
   case, in Italy. To this end, a survey of breeds was performed by means
   of a census questionnaire divided into two parts. The first part
   collected information on breeds, breeders, housing facilities, and
   management aspects, the results of which are presented here. The second
   part of the questionnaire regarded chicken products and their markets,
   and these data will be reported in a second paper. The breed status of
   six chicken breeds was shown to be exceptionally worrying, with total
   numbers ranging from just 18 to 186 birds. Population sizes exceeding
   1000 birds was identified for just four breeds, the maximum being 3400.
   Some improvements in status were noted in relation to breeds which had
   been the subject of conservation efforts in the past. The two most
   common breeds reported are the Bionda Piemontese, a double-purpose
   breed, and the Livorno egg-laying hen. Collo Nudo Italiano, Millefiori
   Piemontese, Pollo Trentino, and Tirolese chicken breeds and the Castano
   Precoce turkey breed were not listed by breeders at all. The most
   reported turkey breeds are the Bronzato Comune and the Ermellinato di
   Rovigo. The population sizes of native Italian poultry breeds were shown
   to be generally poor. Italian poultry farmers and the population at
   large are largely ignorant about indigenous poultry breeds. Thus,
   promoting the virtues of Italian breeds would help their conservation by
   encouraging breeders to rear these birds and consumers to buy their
   products. The identification of strategies to facilitate access to pure
   breed birds is essential, and will require the collaboration of
   university research centers, public entities, and breeders. The results
   presented in this paper constitute the initial part of a more complex
   conservation program.},

Abstract = {Urbanisation is a prominent and increasing form of land-use change, with
   the potential to disrupt the interactions between pollinators such as
   bees and the flowering plants that they visit. This in turn may cause
   cascading local extinctions and have consequences for pollination
   services. Network approaches go beyond simple metrics of abundance and
   species richness, enabling understanding of how the structure of
   plant-pollinator communities are affected by urbanisation. Here we
   compared pollination networks between native vegetation (bushland)
   remnants and residential gardens in the urbanised region of the
   southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot. Across fourteen sites, seven
   per habitat, plant-bee visitor networks were created from surveys
   conducted monthly during the spring-summer period over two years.
   Extinction slope (a measure of how extinctions cascade through the
   network), and network robustness and nestedness were higher for bushland
   remnants, suggesting that networks in bushland remnants had greater
   functional integrity, but if disrupted, more cascading extinctions could
   occur. In contrast, niche overlap between pollinators was higher in
   residential gardens, suggesting greater competition for resources. Most
   species-level properties did not differ between habitats, except for
   normalised degree, which was higher in bushland remnants. In conclusion,
   it appears that pollination networks in managed residential gardens are
   not structurally equivalent with those in bushland remnants. This has
   implications for conservation of wild bee assemblages in this
   biodiversity hotspot, and suggests removal of remnant native vegetation
   for residential development could disrupt the integrity of
   plant-pollinator assemblages.},

Abstract = {Urbanization has been shown to strongly affect community composition of
   various taxa with potentially strong shifts in ecological interactions,
   including those between hosts and parasites. We investigated the effect
   of urbanization on the composition of arthropods in nests of great tits
   in Flanders, Belgium. These nests contain taxonomically and functionally
   diverse arthropod communities including parasites, predators,
   detritivores and accidental commensals. Using a standardized
   hierarchical sampling design with subplots (200 m x 200 m) nested in
   plots (3 km x 3 km) of varying urbanization levels, we collected
   arthropods from nests of resident great tits after the young had
   fledged. Arthropods were extracted, identified to Primary Taxonomical
   Groups (PTG) and counted. Using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs)
   we found diverging effects of urbanization on PTG occurrences and
   abundances at various levels, but we did not find an overall signal in
   arthropod diversity or richness. Also, visual inspection of non-metric
   multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots did not reveal any community
   differences between urbanization levels at plot or subplot scales. Land
   use and environmental variables at different distances around nestboxes
   did not contribute much to the variation between communities. Our
   results indicate that arthropod nestbox communities are generally not
   adversely affected by urbanization, and even city gardens and parks
   harbor comparable communities to forests and suburban areas. We thus
   found no evidence for a parasite release effect due to urbanization, nor
   an increased risk of parasitism in human-dominated environments.},

Title = {Effect of Weed Management on the Parasitoid Community in Mediterranean
   Vineyards},
Journal = {BIOLOGY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Parasitoid wasps control insect pests in agricultural crops, but often
   require additional resources from non-crop plants. Vineyard growers
   sometimes address this need by planting or sowing pre-selected herbs
   around the plots or between the vine rows. Here, we explored the simpler
   strategy of conserving spontaneously growing weeds within Mediterranean
   vineyards, and trimming them mechanically when they reach large size and
   interfere with farming activities. We compared this strategy with
   matched plots, in which resident weeds were sprayed regularly with
   herbicides, representing the conventional treatment. As predicted,
   overall parasitoid abundance and the number of parasitoid species were
   higher in the weed conservation plots. However, the direction and
   magnitude of the effect differed between the dominant parasitoid
   species, and populations of some potential pests increased in the weed
   conservation treatment. Conservation of weeds that grow spontaneously in
   vineyards is a low-cost practice that offers multiple benefits, such as
   reduced soil erosion, stabilization of soil temperatures, and diminished
   exposure of farmers to agrochemicals. Our results show that communities
   of important biological control agents may gain from this practice as
   well. Nevertheless, weed conservation within vineyards can only be
   sustainable if its benefits outweigh the risks of attracting crop pests.
   Enriching agroecosystems with non-crop vegetation is a popular strategy
   for conservation biocontrol. In vineyards, the effects of specific
   seeded or planted cover crops on natural enemies are well-studied,
   whereas conserving spontaneously developing weeds received less
   attention. We compared parasitoid communities between matched pairs of
   vineyard plots in northern Israel, differing in weed management
   practices: ``herbicide{''}, repeated herbicide applications vs. ``ground
   cover{''}, maintaining resident weeds and trimming them when needed.
   Using suction sampling, we assessed the parasitoids' abundance,
   richness, and composition during three grape-growing seasons. Ground
   cover plots had greater parasitoid abundances and cumulative species
   richness than herbicide-treated plots, possibly because of their higher
   vegetation cover and richness. Dominant parasitoid species varied in
   their magnitude and direction of response to weed management. Their
   responses seem to combine tracking of host distributions with attraction
   to additional vegetation-provided resources. Parasitoid community
   composition was mildly yet significantly influenced by weed management,
   while season, year, and habitat (weeds vs. vine) had stronger effects.
   Vineyard weeds thus support local biocontrol agents and provide
   additional previously demonstrated benefits (e.g., soil conservation,
   lower agrochemical exposure) but might also attract some crop pests.
   When the benefits outweigh this risk, weed conservation seems a
   promising step towards more sustainable agricultural management.},

Abstract = {Urban parks play a crucial role in conserving the biophysical
   environment, yet conservation efforts mostly focus on biodiversity
   hotspots, iconic mammal species, and nature conservation areas. A
   challenge in enhancing the role of urban parks in conservation relates
   to the varied, and often conflicted, priorities of communities and city
   authorities in the engagement process. Using a qualitative research
   approach through in-depth interviews with community leaders, councilors,
   community-based organizations, and youth organizations, this study
   explores stakeholder engagement in the planning and management of Mofolo
   Park in Soweto, Johannesburg. Results indicate that although the City of
   Johannesburg wanted to add food gardens to the park, the community was
   not united in support of this. Rather, the community wanted better
   safety, security and ablutions in the park, in contrast to the City of
   Johannesburg officials. Community members also expressed concerns about
   water pollution, sewerage spills, security and vandalism within the
   park, noting this inhibited their full enjoyment of the park. The study
   also revealed that women's voices were mostly silenced during community
   discussions. The facilitator, who represented the City of Johannesburg,
   a few extroverted, vocal people and men dominated the discourse. This
   study concludes that although community engagement through stakeholder
   dialogues can, and should, play a crucial role in managing urban parks,
   the priorities and voices of the various stakeholders need to be
   carefully considered if the park is to be sustainably managed and fit
   for purpose as an urban green recreational space for local communities.},

   (Dermanyssoidea: Macronyssidae) Infestation in Portugal},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 14},
Abstract = {Ornithonyssus bursa (Berlese, 1888), also known as the tropical fowl
   mite, is a blood-feeding ectoparasite of domestic and wild birds. It is
   considered a serious pest to poultry in warm and tropical climates and
   has been reported to attack humans, causing gamasoidosis. Avian-mite
   dermatitis may be difficult to recognize and misdiagnosed as bites from
   other arthropods. The present report describes two cases of human
   dermatitis linked to O. bursa infestation. Both cases occurred in an
   apartment in a residential area in Oeiras, Portugal, where two members
   of the same family presented with pruritic erythematous skin eruptions
   disseminated over their body over a period of 4 months. The lesions were
   located mostly in the pelvic, gluteal, coccygeal, and perineal regions,
   and also on the neck, wrists and torso. On inspecting the mattresses and
   the covers of the bedrooms, three mites similar to 1 mm long by 0.5 mm
   wide were found. The three specimens were identified as O. bursa.
   Investigations tracing back the source of infestation, revealed that the
   mites were carried over from chickens raised 45 km away (Sesimbra,
   Setubal) that, after being slaughtered for consumption, had been
   transported by car to the apartment in Oeiras. The chickens were farmed
   in an open backyard henhouse that allowed free access to several species
   of wild birds, including pigeons (Columba livia), turtle doves
   (Streptopelia decaocto), and sparrows (Passer domesticus). Recent
   reports suggest that O. bursa may be established in Mediterranean
   countries, increasing the risk of gamasoidosis. This is the first record
   linking O. bursa infestation of chickens with human dermatitis in
   continental Portugal. More research is needed to assess the extent of
   poultry infestation and evaluate the possible implications for the
   poultry industry, as well as for human health in Portugal.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is one of the most intensive forms of landscape and habitat
   transformation, resulting in species loss, and taxonomic and functional
   homogenization of different communities. Whilst green infrastructure
   (the network of natural and semi-natural areas in cities) has been
   studied extensively in terms of specific features that promote
   biodiversity, there have been no studies that have assessed how species
   richness in different types of green space (GS) varies with increasing
   levels of urbanization in the surrounding matrix. We studied the effects
   of different types of GS and urbanization in the surrounding matrix on
   bird communities in the mid-sized city of Gottingen, Germany. We used
   the point-count method for bird observations in allotments and parks. To
   determine the level of urbanization, we calculated percentage of
   impervious surfaces around GSs. Increasing levels of urbanization around
   GSs had no effect on the species richness, functional traits or the
   community composition of birds. Nevertheless, we found that species
   richness and functional traits varied according to GS type. Parks had a
   greater species richness and were found to have more ground nesting and
   tropical migrant birds compared to allotments. We found more cavity
   nesting and resident birds in allotments. As different types of GS can
   contribute to the presence of different species and functional trait
   variations, their positive effect on bird species richness can be
   enhanced when they are present together in urban landscapes. Our
   findings suggest that green spaces with a high variety of local
   characteristics should be incorporated into urban planning designs in
   order to ensure diverse bird communities in cities.},

Journal = {PSYCHE-A JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Species composition, distribution, and trophic relationships of
   bumblebees are studied in six types of urban habitat: urban parks,
   botanical gardens, least-disturbed areas within the city, residential
   areas, and roadsides. Twenty bumblebee species are recorded in the
   present study. The species composition of bumblebees has changed from
   1933 to 2017. Rare species have disappeared from the city-Bombus
   fragrans, B. cullumanus, and B. jonellus. The core of urban bumblebee
   communities consists of ecologically plastic species, most of which
   belong to the functional morphoecological ``short-tongued{''} group
   (83\%). The more specialized ``medium-tongued{''} and ``long-tongued{''}
   species are less diverse. Their populations make up 14\% and 3\% of the
   total bumblebee population. Five most common species, B. lucorum, B.
   terrestris, B. lapidarius, B. pascuorum, and B. hypnorum, are found at
   locations of the most noted categories of habitats. One of the main
   factors affecting the diversity of morphoecological groups of bumblebees
   in urban conditions is the state of floral resources. The bumblebees are
   observed feeding on more than 60 plant species of the families
   Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, Rosaceae, and Salicaceae in urban
   environment; however, the insects favored plants of 30 species. The
   ornamental, ruderal, and some invasive species of plants are significant
   in bumblebees' feeding in urban conditions. The resources for bumblebee
   feeding and sustainable density of nesting sites are rich in quality and
   quantity only at a few of model urban sites. At these territories, the
   highest species diversity of bumblebee is recorded, including rare,
   protected, and vulnerable species. The ecological potential of other
   studied urban sites is enough to sustain the most ecologically plastic
   bumblebee species.},

Title = {Wild bees and hoverflies respond differently to urbanisation, human
   population density and urban form},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {204},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While urbanisation contributes to global biodiversity declines,
   flower-rich urban habitats may provide beneficial pollinator habitats.
   We investigated the potential of urban residential areas to contribute
   to pollinator diversity by analysing wild bee and hoverfly species
   richness and composition of species assemblages of summer-active
   species, sampled in 53 gardens across urban and rural landscapes of
   Malmo, the regional capital of Sweden's southernmost county. Species
   richness differed between urban and rural gardens, and between four
   urban residential types (ranging from low human density and high
   vegetation cover, to high human density and low vegetation cover), and
   taxonomic groups responded differently. Solitary bee species richness
   was higher in urban than rural gardens, driven by a higher richness in
   low-density urban gardens compared to both high-density urban gardens
   and rural gardens. In contrast, bumblebee species richness was higher in
   rural than urban gardens, whereas differences among the urban types were
   less clear. Hoverfly species richness was consistently higher in rural
   gardens than any urban garden type. Species richness of all groups was
   negatively related to human population density at the landscape scale
   (radius 500 m), but unrelated to vegetation cover. This indicates that
   population density affects pollinator habitat quality through associated
   green space management and design. Rural and urban wild bee species
   assemblages consisted of different species (significant species
   turnover), whereas urban hoverfly assemblages were a subset of rural
   ones (significant nestedness). Species nestedness of hoverflies, but not
   bees, increased with human population density. We show that urban areas
   can complement the regional wild bee species pool, mainly caused by
   large variation in tenure and management at small spatial scales, while
   urbanisation drives a systematic loss of hoverfly species. We suggest
   alternatives to improve dense residential areas for pollinators.},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Resource availability, particularly food, can limit the size of bird
   populations during the nonbreeding season. Resident and short-distance
   migrant birds, wintering in colder environments, should show strong
   effects of food limitation on winter survival. Here, we introduce a
   novel experiment testing for the effect of supplemental feeding on the
   winter survival of the Dark-eyed Junco (junco hyemalis), a short- to
   medium-distance migrant in North America. Color-ringed juncos were
   monitored by resighting in the winters of 2011, 2012, and 2013. Winter
   supplemental feeding significantly increased junco survival within
   winters. However, it is possible that juncos not resighted underwent
   within-winter dispersal rather than died. Thus, in the winter of 2014,
   very high frequency radio transmitters were attached to 29 juncos from
   unsupplemented sites to ascertain the fate of birds not resighted. We
   found that movement beyond the study area was minimal and most juncos
   maintained a discrete home range. Of the radiotagged birds, 27.5\% were
   not resighted during observation periods, but were located and confirmed
   alive via radiotracking. A correction factor for within-winter dispersal
   was applied to previous years' data and the effect of food
   supplementation remained statistically significant for two of the three
   winters; the trend was the same, but not statistically significant
   during the warmest winter. The present results contribute to a
   developing conceptual model of migration-specific effects of winter food
   limitation. Dark-eyed Juncos are an iconic backyard birdfeeder species
   that have shown a steady population decline for decades. Supplemental
   feeding during the wintering period may regularly elevate population
   recruitment by increasing winter survival in avian species that winter
   in thermally challenging environments.},

Abstract = {In latitudinal avian migrants, increasing photoperiods induce fat
   deposition and body mass increase, and subsequent night-time migratory
   restlessness in captive birds, but the underlying mechanisms remain
   poorly understood. We hypothesized that an enhanced hypothalamic
   neuronal plasticity was associated with the photostimulated spring
   migration phenotype. We tested this idea in adult migratory red-headed
   buntings (Emberiza bruniceps), as compared with resident Indian
   weaverbirds (Ploceus philippinus). Birds were exposed to a stimulatory
   long photoperiod (14L:10D, LP), while controls were kept on a short
   photoperiod (10L:14D, SP). Under both photoperiods, one half of birds
   also received a high calorie, protein- and fat-rich diet (SP-R, LP-R)
   while the other half stayed on the normal diet (SP-N, LP-N). Thirty days
   later, as expected, the LP had induced multiple changes in the behaviour
   and physiology in migratory buntings. Photostimulated buntings also
   developed a preference for the rich food diet. Most interestingly, the
   LP and the rich diet, both separately and in association, increased
   neurogenesis in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), as measured by an
   increased number of cells immunoreactive for doublecortin (DCX), a
   marker of recently born neurons, in buntings, but not weaverbirds. This
   neurogenesis was associated with an increased density of fibres
   immunoreactive for the orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY). This
   hypothalamic plasticity observed in a migratory, but not in a
   non-migratory, species in response to photoperiod and food quality might
   represent an adaptation to the pre-migratory fattening, as required to
   support the extensive energy expenses that incur during the migratory
   flight.},

Title = {Designing parks for older adults: A qualitative study using walk-along
   interviews},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {54},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The proportion of older adults in the population is increasing and
   ageing is associated with poorer physical, mental and social health.
   Hence, there is increasing need for community facilities that are
   appealing and suitable to older adults and promote good health and
   well-being. Visiting parks has been shown to facilitate a multitude of
   physical, psychological, and social health benefits; however, the
   frequency of park visitation by older adults is low. A better
   understanding of the needs and preferences of park features among older
   adults will help park designers to create parks that encourage their
   visitation. The aim of this qualitative walk-along study was to explore
   park features that influence park visitation, park-based physical
   activity and social interaction among older adults (65+ years).
   Participants (n = 30, mean age = 74.9 years {[}sd 5.4)], 50 \% female)
   were interviewed by a researcher while walking in one of eight diverse
   parks located in varying socio-economic status areas of metropolitan
   Melbourne, Australia. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and
   analysed using NVivo 12 software. Participants primarily reported using
   parks for walking, sitting/relaxing, enjoying nature and socialising
   with others and walking was the preferred park-based activity. Park
   features highly valued for visitation included: a well-maintained,
   peaceful and attractive environment with established trees, gardens and
   birdlife; seating; pleasant paths; toilets; cafes; water features;
   shade/shelter; facilities for grandchildren; and the presence of other
   people. Features most valued for physical activity included walking
   paths, organised activities, and fitness equipment. Features most valued
   for social interaction included picnic/barbecue facilities, organised
   events, a cafe and aesthetics. This evidence is important for policy and
   decision makers, urban planning, landscape architects, and local, state
   and national government organisations to ensure our parks are designed
   to support older adults to lead healthy and active lives.},

Title = {``It may also have prevented churchgoers from falling asleep{''}:
   southernwood,Artemisia abrotanumL. (fam. Asteraceae), in the
   church bouquet, and its contemporary presence as a heritage plant in
   Sweden},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Introduction Southernwood,Artemisia abrotanumL., is a plant that has
   been cultivated for centuries. Most probable is that it has its origin
   in the eastern Mediterranean area. It has been kept for its fragrance
   and has a history of being a medicinal and insect-repellent plant. In
   earlier centuries, the plant was commonly found in peasants' gardens in
   Sweden and utilised especially as a component in the bouquets brought to
   church by women. The aim of this article is to bring together data
   aboutArtemisia abrotanumand to summarise its cultural history and folk
   botanical importance. In Sweden, it is still grown in some gardens in
   the countryside and is esteemed for its fragrance. Methods In the early
   twentieth century, various folklore archives in Sweden (Lund, Uppsala)
   distributed questionnaires about the use of church bouquets. These
   records provided interesting information about the importance of
   southernwood and other species. We have also used data found in
   ethnographic records and local historical reports. Between 2007 and
   2017, a nationwide inventory organised by the Programme for Diversity of
   Cultivated Plants (POM) documented and gathered several heirloom
   varieties of southernwood. Results and discussion Together with a few
   other domestic plants of foreign origin (e.g.Lavandula
   angustifoliaMill.,Tanacetum balsamitaL., andTanacetum
   vulgareL.),Artemisia abrotanumhas been cultivated throughout Sweden in
   peasants' gardens as a medicinal plant and for its fragrance. According
   to the sources,Artemisia abrotanumwas one of the most common species
   cultivated by the Swedish peasantry. Although used in folk medicine and
   to some extent as a repellent, it was most esteemed for its fragrance.
   Peasant women would carry a twig of the plant in the obligatory church
   bouquet or in the hymnal when attending the services in the Lutheran
   church on Sundays. In Sweden, this custom with the church bouquet has
   been known since the time of the Reformation in the sixteenth century
   and survived until the late nineteenth century, when major changes took
   place in connection with industrialisation, modernisation,
   secularisation and urbanisation. Although the custom with the church
   bouquet disappeared, nationwide inventories conducted by the Programme
   for Diversity of Cultivated Plants in 2007-2015 revealed that the plant
   still exists in many gardens on the countryside throughout Sweden as a
   cultural relict and reminiscence plants. People care for the plant, have
   sentiments for it and it is spread from person-to-person. Several
   heirloom varieties have been discovered, which will be preserved ex situ
   for the future. Conclusions Southernwood was probably the most commonly
   used herb in the peasant women's church bouquet until the end of the
   nineteenth century. It had a satisfying fragrance and was easy to grow.
   Although the custom has disappeared, the plant has survived until the
   present day in many gardens as a reminiscence of the custom of former
   times.},

Title = {Eradicating the large white butterfly from New Zealand eliminates a
   threat to endemic Brassicaceae},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {In May 2010 the large white butterfly,Pieris brassicaeL. (Lepidoptera:
   Pieridae), was discovered to have established in New Zealand. It is a
   Palearctic species that-due to its wide host plant range within the
   Brassicaceae-was regarded as a risk to New Zealand's native brassicas.
   New Zealand has 83 native species of Brassicaceae including 81 that are
   endemic, and many are threatened by both habitat loss and herbivory by
   other organisms. Initially a program was implemented to slow its spread,
   then an eradication attempt commenced in November 2012.
   TheP.brassicaepopulation was distributed over an area of approximately
   100 km(2)primarily in urban residential gardens. The eradication attempt
   involved promoting public engagement and reports of sightings, including
   offering a bounty for a two week period, systematically searching
   gardens forP.brassicaeand its host plants, removing host plants,
   ground-based spraying of insecticide to kill eggs and larvae, searching
   for pupae, capturing adults with nets, and augmenting natural enemy
   populations. The attempt was supported by research that helped to
   progressively refine the eradication strategy and evaluate its
   performance. The last New Zealand detection ofP.brassicaeoccurred on 16
   December 2014, the eradication program ceased on 4 June 2016
   andP.brassicaewas officially declared eradicated from New Zealand on 22
   November 2016, 6.5 years after it was first detected and 4 years after
   the eradication attempt commenced. This is the first species of
   butterfly ever to have been eradicated worldwide.},

Journal = {CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-36},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Caribbean is a biodiversity hotspot due to its rich biodiversity and
   wholesale loss of primary vegetation. Yet, there is a paucity of studies
   on the status and trends of terrestrial avifauna populations in the
   region. We combined survey data from six habitats (Quill and Gilboa
   Hill, Town, Botanical Garden, Garden Road, and Venus Bay) on a small
   Lesser Antillean island over a seven-year period. Species abundance and
   richness varied among habitats, with Town having the highest species
   richness. Logistic regressions revealed significant differences among
   habitat and year (P = 0.008), but not foraging guild, season, rainfall
   or elevation (P > 0.05). The Quill (P = 0.0003) and Town (P = 0.001)
   differed significantly from the other habitats surveyed. Granivorous +
   frugivorous and omnivorous species were most commonly detected in the
   Quill, whereas nectarivores and granivores were most commonly detected
   in Town. The influence of total annual precipitation on bird detection
   rates was unsubstantial. However, site-specific climate data for the
   different habitats are not available. Though resident landbird
   populations on St. Eustatius were stable over the survey period, we
   recommend that annual monitoring continue in the same habitats,
   especially following extensive vegetation damage caused by hurricanes
   Irma and Maria in September 2017 and in light of predicted global
   climate change. The results of our monitoring proved useful in
   evaluating protected areas and Important Bird Areas compared with
   non-protected areas. We encourage island researchers and conservation
   stewards to initiate similar long-term monitoring in order to determine
   the status of their resident landbird populations.},

Title = {Environmental interactions between people and birds in semiarid lands of
   the Zapotitlan Valley, Central Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {Background Birds have been among the most important element in lives of
   humans around the world, due to their presence and abundance in
   practically all ecosystems. Zapotitlan Salinas, a community of the
   Tehuacan Valley, has been a site of interest for studying ecology of
   bird communities, but no previous studies addressing the relationship
   between humans and birds have been conducted in the area. Based on their
   local knowledge, people of the area shape the use and conservation of
   local bird fauna diversity, which is being maintained or lost under the
   influence of factors like commerce, tourism, agriculture intensification
   or abandonment, public policies for conservation, environmental changes,
   among others. This study aims to analyze the patterns of interactions
   between humans and birds in a context of high biocultural diversity with
   a long history and facing the environmental and social challenges of
   semiarid areas. Methods Ecological sampling for documenting bird species
   richness was conducted from November 2015 to May 2017 in three transects
   that included agroforestry systems, forests, and fallow agricultural
   land. The method of counting by fixed radius points at 16 points within
   the study systems was used. Thirty in-depth interviews were conducted
   with local people who own land in the study areas by random sampling and
   choosing experts of Zapotitlan Salinas, Puebla, a semiarid natural
   protected area and, since 2019, recognized as Mixed World Heritage. Some
   visitor guides of the Helia Bravo Hollis Botanical Garden who are member
   of the community and local people who dedicated part of their time to
   catching birds were considered as local experts. They have experience in
   identifying birds through bird watching and listening to bird songs, as
   well as their knowledge on behavior and habits of the bird species
   occurring in their locality. We in addition conducted free listing of
   bird species recognized by people and interviews on ecological aspects,
   forms of use, and management of birds using a photographic catalog as
   visual stimulus. The following aspects were addressed with local people:
   (i) the bird species of Zapotitlan recognized by them; (ii) the
   biological, ecological, and behavioral knowledge about these species;
   (iii) the description of practices of use and management of these
   animals; (iv) the perceived changes regarding presence and abundance of
   the wild birds recognized; and (v) the regulations of these practices
   and uses. Results Through the ecological sampling, we identified 89 bird
   species, a number representing nearly 68\% of all species reported for
   the Zapotitlan Valley. The species recorded belong to 61 genera, 26
   families, and 11 orders. Local people interviewed recognized 62
   morphospecies occurring in their territory, and designated them with 50
   local names. The interactions of local people with birds and the
   knowledge related to habitats and habits varied according to people's
   daily life activities and the ways of inter-generational transmission of
   knowledge. The interactions identified respond to several motivations.
   The most intense are those of utilitarian nature (three types of use are
   recognized: nutritional, medicinal, and ornamental), while other less
   notorious but equally relevant are those related to the awareness and
   conservation of biological diversity, and aesthetic appreciation of
   nature. Also relevant are those interactions shaped by the people's
   worldview since some species are interpreted as climatic environmental
   predictors, amulets, or omens.
   Conclusions To understand the various human-bird environmental
   interactions, it is necessary not only to address the utilitarian
   assessment that species have in a specific place but also those
   associated with cultural expressions and the connection between these
   aspects. Lifestyles, traditions, and beliefs model intangible forms of
   use, such as the interpretation of climate predictors. Ancient roles of
   birds in local culture are ongoing, and new demand of ornamental birds
   from cities influences catching activities but local and regional
   regulations have contributed to maintain them below a critical level.},

Abstract = {Urban expansion is considered to be one of the main threats to global

   those found in allotments (community gardens) and domestic gardens, and
   improving management approaches in urban greenspace and highly urbanised
   areas (e.g. by increasing floral resources and nesting sites) will
   benefit pollinator conservation. Opportunities for pollinator

   Case Study in the Tallinn Zoological Gardens},
Journal = {BIOSEMIOTICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {115-135},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper addresses the biosemiotic dimensions of human relationship
   with captive animals and aims to uncover how these factors influence
   handling practices and human-animal interactions within zoological
   gardens. Zoological gardens are quintessential hybrid environments, and
   as such, they are places of interspecies interactions and mutual
   influences. These interactions are profoundly shaped by human attitudes
   towards animals. The roots of these attitudes can be found at the
   cultural and institutional levels (how particular animal species are
   culturally perceived and managed in zoos) as well as at the biosemiotic
   level (similarities between Umwelten). Previous studies have suggested
   that keepers' attitudes towards animals have direct influences on their
   handling style and, consequently, have an impact on animals' perception
   of keepers and other humans. This suggests that the type of relationship
   between keepers and animals can translate into handling styles that may
   affect animals' perceptions of humans and worsen or improve their
   welfare. In this paper, we present a case study involving chimpanzees'
   keepers at the Tallinn Zoological Gardens (Estonia). A series of
   interviews were conducted, which aimed to uncover the way keepers
   understand their relationships with captive animals and how this
   influences handling. This work offers a comparative approach by bringing
   forward the experiences of keepers who work with various animal species
   belonging to different taxa (Cebuella pygmae, Pan troglodytes) and class
   (Mammalia and Reptilia, i.e. Crocodylus porosus). Such an approach aims
   to highlight the biosemiotic factors behind the emergence of different
   types of keeper-animal relationships. We expect to uncover whether
   extremely different Umwelten may shape human-animal bonds. By
   highlighting the agency of animals in daily activities and work routine,
   we also aim to initiate a discussion on the way animals influence
   handling practices within zoological gardens. Our objective is to
   understand how individual animals influence handling practices within
   zoological gardens.},

Journal = {HERPETOLOGICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {93-98},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus has a natural distribution
   in North America, but was spread by human activities in different
   regions around the world. It is listed as the most invasive amphibian
   species, affecting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and the community
   of native species. In addition, the American bullfrog is extensively
   associated with lethal pathogens, with high correlation of the presence
   of this species with population declines and extinctions. Here we test
   if this alien species has spread through the landscape, establishing
   populations at new locations. We used diverse methods including
   georeferencing of satellite images, ethnobiological interviews and field
   data to evaluate the dispersion and effects of L. catesbeianus
   introduction on amphibian composition, species number, and density of
   individuals in forest fragments in an Atlantic Forest landscape. We did
   not find any relationship between density of individuals, number of
   species or composition of the native anuran assemblages in forest
   fragments in relation to the presence or proximity of American bullfrog
   introduction points. Additionally, we found that the dispersion
   potential of this species in the studied landscape is zero, as it was
   only found in those fragments where it was specifically introduced 15
   years ago. The species has not established new populations in the
   landscape. Although exotic, L. catesbeianus thrives in lentic habitats
   and has no apparent effect on the structural metrics of the native
   anuran assemblage. Despite this alien species exhibiting a capacity to
   adapt and survive at the point of introduction, its potential for
   propagation is limited probably by the fragmented terrestrial landscape
   and regional stream network.},

   of 243 plant species were recorded from the studied homegardens of which
   six species were used as food plants for rearing of Eri silkworm and 10
   species were used in construction of mountage. Trees related to Eri
   culture contributed to 37.47\% of the total importance value index (IVI)
   in the studied homegardens. Heteropanax fragrans (Roxb.) Seem and
   Ricinus communes L. were the primary food plants of Eri silkworm and
   were found to be dominant in the homegardens. Activities such as land
   preparation, sowing, pruning, weeding and watering are carried out for
   the management of Eri silkworm food plant species and were found to vary
   for different species.
   Interpretation : There is an urgent need to document the indigenous
   knowledge and traditional practices associated with the management of
   host and food plants used in the rearing of Eri silkworm in the present
   day context as it is a part of their cultural heritage and should be
   reoriented through integration of modern farming technique.},

Title = {``ONE THOUGHT ONLY OF FOOD...{''}: ROUTINE PRACTICES OF KURGAN PEOPLE
   DURING STARVATION OF THE EARLY 1920S},

Year = {2020},

Pages = {80-87},
Abstract = {The article considers routine practices of Kurgan's people survival
   during the starvation in 1921-1922. In Kurgan, starvation reached its
   climax in the spring of 1922, when a third of the urban population went
   hungry. The remaining residents of Kurgan were in comparatively better
   conditions due to their salaries and personal subsidiary plots. The
   salaries of ordinary Kurgan workers and clerks were small, but job loss
   was critical for people. Vegetable gardens and livestock were of a
   significant help for many citizens, as well as other things that they
   could sell and change for food. Substitute goods and carrion of animals
   and birds became food. Extreme conditions forced the population to
   change their usual lifestyle. Some people, trying to escape from the
   starvation, moved to more favourable regions of the country. The rest
   tried to survive on small wages and scarce food rations; step by step
   they sold their property, tried to get special cards for canteens,
   begged, etc. Cards for canteens immediately became the subject of
   machinations as something valuable. In general, the criminal situation
   escalated: because of starvation, petty and grand thefts, assaults and
   murders spread widely. Throughout the interwar period, in the memory of
   Kurgan people, there was a fear of starvation of 1921-1922. Frequent
   supply breakdowns were accompanied by worrying rumors and a desire to
   stock up on something. Standard distribution, hours-long queues became a
   part of the routine life of Soviet citizens.},

Title = {Identifying indigenous practices for cultivation of wild saprophytic
   mushrooms: responding to the need for sustainable utilization of natural
   resources},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},

Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {Background Due to increasing pressure on natural resources, subsistence
   agriculture communities in Uganda and Sub-Saharan Africa are
   experiencing increasingly restricted access to diminishing natural
   resources that are a critical requirement of their livelihoods.
   Previously, common-pool resources like forests and grasslands have been
   either gazetted for conservation or leased for agriculture, the latter
   in particular for large-scale sugarcane production. Satisfying the
   increasing consumer demand for grassland or forestry products like wild
   mushrooms as food or medicine, requires innovative ethno-biological and
   industry development strategies to improve production capacity, while
   easing the pressure on diminishing natural resources and averting
   ecosystems degradation. Methods This case study addresses traditional
   knowledge systems for artisanal mycoculture to identify cultivation
   practices that enhance sustainable utilization of natural resources.
   Multi-scalar stakeholder engagement across government and community
   sectors identified artisanal mushroom producers across five districts in
   Uganda. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews characterized
   artisanal production methods and identified locally used substrates for
   cultivation of different mushroom species. Results Artisanal practices
   were characterized for the cultivation of six wild saprophytic mushroom
   species including Volvariella speciosa (akasukusuku), two Termitomyces
   sp. (obunegyere and another locally unnamed species), Agaricus sp.
   (ensyabire) and Agrocybe sp. (emponzira), and one exotic Pleurotus sp.
   (oyster) that are used as food or medicine. The substrates used for each
   species differed according to the mushroom's mode of decomposition,
   those being the following: tertiary decomposers such as those growing
   under rotting tree stumps or logs from forestry activity like the
   Agrocybe sp. known as emponzira which grows in forests, thickets, or
   near homesteads where big logs of hardwood have been left to rot. Also
   pieces of firewood are chipped off whenever need arises thus providing
   fuel; secondary decomposers growing on naturally composted grass
   associated with termites like the Termitomyces sp. known as obunegyere
   growing in protected sites in gardens, composted cattle manure for
   Agaricus sp. known as ensyabire in the kraal area where cattle manure is
   plenty, composted maize cobs for a locally unnamed Agaricus sp. on
   heaped cobs placed near homesteads; and primary decomposers growing on
   waste sorghum from brewing the traditional alcoholic drink, muramba for
   Pleurotus sp. (oyster), and banana and spear grass residue from banana
   juice processing like the Volvariella speciosa known as akasukusuku
   because it is associated with the banana plantation locally known in the
   Luganda language as olusuku and is usually heaped under ficus trees.
   Management practices also varied based on mode of decomposition and
   other ecological requirements such as the following: zero tillage and
   minimal disturbance in areas where obunegyere grow, heaping banana and
   spear grass residues under the cool ficus trees which also keep them
   away from banana stump that may cause infestation with nematodes and
   insects. Even within the generic practices accessibility by the users is
   critical for example placing logs near homes where children can use them
   to play, they can be used as fire wood and to even get off-season
   mushroom as household waste water can make the mushrooms grow.
   Conclusions Our description of artisanal mycoculture methods that
   respond to conservation and utilization pressures, demonstrates the
   value of addressing traditional knowledge to improve ethno-biology and
   mycoculture industry practice. Traditional communities engage in
   multiple technological and organizational innovations and practices for
   sustainability and in the case of mushroom production to conserve the
   environment and culture, ensure variety, food and nutrition security,
   and income. The results of this study present opportunities to preserve
   ecosystem quality while developing an artisanal mycoculture system. They
   have also identified aspects of artisanal mycoculture that most urgently
   require further ethno-biological study and industry development. Future
   research and industry development can utilize the result of this study
   to boost artisanal production of wild saprophytic mushrooms in
   Sub-Saharan countries, for food or medicinal consumption, and
   environment conservation. Further development of production efficiencies
   in context with sustainable natural resource management is recommended.},

Abstract = {An `attract-and-kill' (AK) device was evaluated for suppression of adult
   Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae),
   on residential citrus. The AK device, made from weather-resistant
   plasticized PVC, lured D. citri adults by simulating the color of citrus
   flush and killed them with beta-cyfluthrin. This study evaluated: 1)
   lethality of AK devices weathered up to 8 wk on residential citrus; 2)
   survival of psyllids caged with potted plants and AK devices; 3) psyllid
   suppression achieved by AK devices on individual dooryard trees. AK
   devices weathered for up to 8 wk remained lethal to psyllids. Greenhouse
   trials evaluated survival of adult psyllids caged for 4 d with orange
   jasmine plants that were: 1) treated with an (beta-cyfluthrin-infused)
   AK device; 2) treated with a blank (no insecticide) AK device; or 3)
   `untreated' with no AK device. After 4 d, psyllid survival was on
   average 95\% lower among adults exposed to plants with AK devices than
   adults exposed to untreated plants or plants with blank AK devices. Less
   than half of the adults exposed to plants with AK devices were alive
   after 1 d and nearly all were dead after 4 d. Deployment of 20 AK
   devices per tree provided significant psyllid suppression on infested
   lemon trees from winter to summer and reduced mean reproduction
   (cumulative eggs) by 91\% and mean attack intensity (cumulative
   psyllid-days) of adults by 59\% and nymphs by 53\%. AK devices could be
   an effective control option for D. citri in urban areas.},

Abstract = {In 2017, we found 17 dead females of Megachile frigida Smith in clear
   plastic bags of composted bark mulch in a residential yard in Bozeman,
   Montana, USA. Females apparently entered bags via small ventilation
   holes, then became trapped and died. To investigate whether this is a
   common source of mortality, we deployed unmodified bags of mulch and
   those fitted with cardboard tubes (as potential nest sites) at three
   nearby sites in 2018. We found two dead M. frigida females and five
   completed leaf cells in one of these bags of mulch fitted with cardboard
   tubes; two male M. frigida emerged from these leaf cells. In 2018, we
   also discovered three dead female M. frigida and three dead females of a
   second leafcutter bee species, Megachile gemula Cresson, in clear bags
   of another type of bark mulch. Both mulches emitted nearly identical
   blends of volatile organic compounds, suggesting their odors could

Title = {Exposure to Non-Native Tropical Milkweed Promotes Reproductive
   Development in Migratory Monarch Butterflies},
Journal = {INSECTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: North American monarchs (Danaus plexippus) are well-known
   for their long-distance migrations; however, some monarchs within the
   migratory range have adopted a resident lifestyle and breed year-round
   at sites where tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica) is planted in
   the southern coastal United States. An important question is whether
   exposure to exotic milkweed alters monarch migratory physiology,
   particularly the ability to enter and remain in the hormonally-induced
   state of reproductive diapause, whereby adults delay reproductive
   maturity. Cued by cooler temperatures and shorter photoperiods, diapause
   is a component of the monarch's migratory syndrome that includes
   directional flight behavior, lipid accumulation, and the exceptional
   longevity of the migratory generation. Methods: Here, we experimentally
   test how exposure to tropical milkweed during the larval and adult
   stages influences monarch reproductive status during fall migration.
   Caterpillars reared under fall-like conditions were fed tropical versus
   native milkweed diets, and wild adult migrants were placed in outdoor
   flight cages with tropical milkweed, native milkweed, or no milkweed.
   Results: We found that monarchs exposed to tropical milkweed as larvae
   were more likely to be reproductively active (exhibit mating behavior in
   males and develop mature eggs in females) compared to monarchs exposed
   to native milkweed. Among wild-caught fall migrants, females exposed to
   tropical milkweed showed greater egg development than females exposed to
   native or no milkweed, although a similar response was not observed for
   males. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence that exposure to
   tropical milkweed can increase monarch reproductive activity, which
   could promote continued residency at year-round breeding sites and
   decrease monarch migratory propensity.},

Journal = {INDOOR AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {7},
Pages = {887-904},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Indoor vertical greenery systems (iVGSs) are usually linked to drawbacks
   such as high initial investment and maintenance costs, and possible
   damage to buildings. Plants may attract insects and mosquitoes, and some
   release excessive pollen if indoors. Moss gardening might be an
   alternative solution because bryophytes are environment friendly in
   conserving water, controlling erosion, filtering hazardous chemicals and
   rainwater, and sequestering carbon. The aim of this study is to develop
   a Moss-iVGS design protocol by considering the characteristics of a
   Moss-iVGS prototype, foliage thickness, and the influence of lighting on
   moss cultivation in the tropics. A mixed approach combining experiments
   and a questionnaire survey was adopted. Results show that Moss-iVGS can
   withstand 45 days of drought without any water supply or regular
   maintenance. The moss was able to absorb moisture from humid air to
   maintain its survival. Moss is abundant in nature, easy to maintain, has
   high aesthetic value, and has numerous environmental benefits in the
   long run. Conventional VGS drawbacks could be possibly solved or
   mitigated by Moss-iVGS. Not limited to a pattern, Moss-iVGS could have
   various types of design such as moss tile and moss carpet for indoor
   use. Different species of moss could be tested in various indoor
   environments in a further study to assist commercialization.},

Abstract = {The multiple benefits of `nature' for human health and well-being have
   been documented at an increasing rate over the past 30 years. A growing
   body of research also demonstrates the positive well-being benefits of
   nature-connectedness. There is, however, a lack of evidence about how
   people's subjective nature experience relates to deliberately designed
   and managed urban green infrastructure (GI) with definable `objective'
   characteristics such as vegetation type, structure and density. Our
   study addresses this gap. Site users (n = 1411) were invited to walk
   through woodland, shrub and herbaceous planting at three distinctive
   levels of planting structure at 31 sites throughout England, whilst
   participating in a self-guided questionnaire survey assessing reactions
   to aesthetics, perceived plant and invertebrate biodiversity,
   restorative effect, nature-connectedness and socio-demographic
   characteristics. There was a significant positive relationship between
   perceived naturalness and planting structure. Perceived naturalness was
   also positively related to the perceived plant and invertebrate
   biodiversity value, participants' aesthetic appreciation and the
   self-reported restorative effect of the planting. A negative
   relationship was recorded between perceived naturalness and perceived
   tidiness and care. Our findings showed that participants perceived
   `naturalness' as biodiverse, attractive and restorative, but not
   necessarily tidy. Perceived naturalness was also related to
   participants' educational qualifications, gender and
   nature-connectedness, with women and more nature-connected participants
   perceiving significantly greater levels of naturalness in the planting.
   These findings are highly significant for policymakers and built
   environment professionals throughout the world aiming to design, manage
   and fund urban GI to achieve positive human health and biodiversity
   outcomes. This applies particularly under austerity approaches to
   managing urban green spaces where local authorities have experienced
   cuts in funding and must prioritise and justify GI maintenance practices
   and regimes.

Abstract = {There is a multi-billion dollar global industry dedicated to feeding
   wild birds in residential gardens. This extraordinary boost to food
   resources is almost certainly reshaping entire bird communities, yet the
   large-scale, long-term impacts on community ecology remain unknown. Here
   we reveal a 40-year transformation of the bird communities using garden
   bird feeders in Britain, and provide evidence to suggest how this may
   have contributed to national-scale population changes. We find that
   increases in bird diversity at feeders are associated with increasing
   community evenness, as species previously rarely observed in gardens
   have increasingly exploited the growing variety of foods on offer over
   time. Urban areas of Britain are consequently nurturing growing
   populations of feeder-using bird species, while the populations of
   species that do not use feeders remain unchanged. Our findings
   illustrate the on-going, gross impact people can have on bird community

Abstract = {Understanding the complex diversity of species and their potential uses
   in traditional agroforestry systems is crucial for enhancing the
   productivity of tropical systems and ensuring the sustainability of the
   natural resource base. The aim of this study is the evaluation of the
   role of home gardens and parklands, which are prominent tropical
   agroforestry systems, in the conservation and management of
   biodiversity. Our study quantified and compared the diversity of woody
   and herbaceous perennial species and their uses in traditional home
   gardens and parkland agroforestry systems under a sub-humid climate in
   western Ethiopia. A sociological survey of 130 household respondents
   revealed 14 different uses of the species, mostly for shade, fuelwood,
   food, and as traditional medicine. Vegetation inventory showed that the
   Fisher's alpha diversity index and species richness were significantly
   higher in home gardens (Fisher's alpha = 5.28 +/- 0.35) than in
   parklands (Fisher's alpha = 1.62 +/- 0.18). Both systems were
   significantly different in species composition (Sorenson's similarity
   coefficient = 35\%). The differences occurred primarily because of the
   high intensity of management and the cultivation of exotic tree species
   in the home gardens, whereas parklands harbored mostly native flora
   owing to the deliberate retention and assisted regeneration by farmers.
   In home gardens, Mangifera indica L. was the most important woody
   species, followed by Cordia africana Lam. and Coffea arabica L. On the
   other hand, Syzygium guineense Wall. was the most important species in
   parklands, followed by C. africana and M. indica. The species diversity
   of agroforestry practices must be further augmented with both indigenous
   and useful, non-invasive exotic woody and herbaceous species,
   particularly in parklands that showed lower than expected species
   diversity compared to home-gardens.},

   Using a systems approach, we developed Bayesian network models
   integrating pollinator dispersal and resource switching to estimate
   city-scale effects of management interventions on plant-pollinator
   community robustness to species loss. We show that residential gardens
   and allotments (community gardens) are pollinator `hotspots': gardens
   due to their extensive area, and allotments due to their high pollinator
   diversity and leverage on city-scale plant-pollinator community
   robustness. Household income was positively associated with pollinator
   abundance in gardens, highlighting the influence of socioeconomic
   factors. Our results underpin urban planning recommendations to enhance
   pollinator conservation, using increasing city-scale community

Abstract = {This study compares caterpillar communities (Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera
   sawflies) in agricultural hedgerows dominated by aggressive non-native
   plants (novel hedgerows) and hedgerows comprised largely of indigenous
   plants. It differs from controlled common garden studies because it
   examines the impact of evolutionarily novel plants that have replaced
   native plants in unmanaged ecosystems and thus provides a more accurate
   measure of what is happening to interactions between plants and insects
   in invaded natural areas. Four hedgerows of each treatment were searched
   methodically along 100m transects during June and July 2011 for a
   seasonal total of 500min each. Seasonal totals of species richness,
   caterpillar abundance, and caterpillar biomass were recorded and
   compared using linear mixed models. We also estimated a Lepidoptera
   productivity index for each hedgerow based on the plant species
   composition and biomass as well as literature host records for each
   species present. Although we found similar richness of plant species,
   and more plant biomass in novel hedgerows, novel hedgerows had 68\%
   fewer caterpillar species, 91\% fewer caterpillars, and 96\% less
   caterpillar biomass than native hedgerows. Moreover, novel hedgerows
   were predicted to have 5.4 times less Lepidoptera productivity based on
   their plant composition. Interactions between caterpillars and hedgerow
   plants were also significantly impacted by introduced plants, with novel
   hedgerows supporting 84\% fewer interactions between plants and
   caterpillars and 57\% less interaction diversity than native hedgerows.
   This is a considerably larger impact of novel plants on a critical
   component of terrestrial food webs than has been measured in common
   garden experiments at the same location and demonstrates that
   plant-herbivore interactions are compromised when novel species replace
   resident species, even if plant species richness does not change.},

Abstract = {Long-term and widespread monitoring programs are essential to
   understanding the role of human-dominated landscapes in supporting wild
   bee populations. Urbanization results in increased impervious surfaces
   throughout the landscape, fragmentation of green space, and a loss of
   naturally occurring floral vegetation. All of these changes have a
   negative impact on pollinator diversity. The objective of this study was
   to assess the abundance and richness of wild bee species throughout a
   small city in northwest Pennsylvania and identify how management of land
   throughout the city may influence bee communities. Seventeen sites
   across a land use gradient, moving from areas with large open spaces and
   mainly permeable surfaces, to sites in the city center consisting of
   mainly impermeable surfaces, were sampled over a 2-year period. During
   this time, 106 known species were identified with four state records and
   1 undescribed species. Bee species richness was greatest at sites with
   the largest amount of permeable surface and naturally-occurring, native
   vegetation. Richness decreased on the college campus and city center
   where landscapes were highly managed and impermeable surfaces were most
   abundant. While floral richness was not related to bee abundance and
   richness, the number of open blooms near traps did have a positive
   impact on bee species richness. Overall, this survey revealed
   considerable richness never before recorded for northwest Pennsylvania,
   suggesting the importance of conservation management in homeowner and
   community yard space.},

Abstract = {Plant genetic variation can have far-reaching effects on associated
   communities and ecosystems. Heritable variation in ecologically relevant
   plant traits is often non-randomly distributed across a species' range
   and can exhibit geographic clines. In the event of range expansions and
   migration, previously unfamiliar genotypes may have large impacts on
   resident communities and ecosystems due to the introduction of novel and
   heritable phenotypic variation. Here we test the hypothesis that
   geographic origin of a focal plant genotype has effects on belowground
   invertebrate communities using a common garden field experiment. We
   sampled soil invertebrates from 103 Oenothera biennis genotypes, which
   were collected from across the species' range and planted into a common
   garden field experiment at the northern range limit. We enumerated 24
   000 individuals from 190 morphospecies and found that the diversity,
   abundance, and composition of soil invertebrate communities varied
   greatly among plant genotypes. Despite strong effects of plant genotype,
   we found few genetic correlations between plant traits and soil
   invertebrate community variables. However, herbivore damage was strongly
   related to variation in the soil invertebrate community. Geographic
   origin of plant genotypes had at most a weak effect on belowground
   communities. We speculate that predicting the extended effects of
   population movement on associated communities will require detailed
   knowledge of the trait variation occurring within focal species across
   particular environmental gradients.},

Abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses continue to threaten
   smallholder poultry producers in several South-east Asian countries,
   including Vietnam. In particular, the free-grazing duck system has been
   repeatedly highlighted as a major risk factor for HPAI outbreaks.
   Free-grazing ducks, which scavenge on rice paddies after the harvest,
   account for a large proportion of the duck population in Vietnam and the
   wider South-east Asian region. However, the structure and dynamics of
   the free-grazing duck production from farm to consumption has not been
   described for Vietnam. In this study, we used a value chain approach to
   provide a complete picture of the actors involved in the production and
   marketing of free-grazing duck eggs and spent layer ducks, as well as to
   investigate the governance structure of this food system. Group
   interviews and key informant interviews were conducted in two provinces
   located in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) and the Red River Delta (RRD).
   The results presented here highlight similarities and differences in
   farming and trade practices between the two provinces. The trade of
   spent layer ducks involved large volumes of live ducks being sent to
   China and Cambodia for consumption, generating a substantial risk of
   transboundary spread of pathogens, including HPAI viruses. We describe
   the major role of duck yards, which act as hubs in the northbound trade
   of spent layer ducks. These yards should be considered as essential
   links in the value chain of spent layer ducks when considering HPAI
   surveillance and control. The veterinary authorities are only marginally
   involved in the value chain activities, and their influence could be
   strengthened by increasing surveillance activities for instance in duck
   yards. Last, we discuss the dynamics of the duck value chain and further
   implications for future HPAI management policies.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The period from 1890 to 1960 in Australia, as elsewhere, is widely
   acknowledged as pivotal in the development of modernity, involving
   increasing urbanisation, commodification, nationalism, state power,
   bureaucratisation, occupational specialisation, technocratic thinking
   and faith in science. This era ushered in a vastly expanded state
   infrastructure for environmental management, and saw the rise and fall
   of progressive conservation activism, as well as precursors to the
   popular environmentalism emerging in the 1960s. Little, however, is
   known of how typical middle-and working-class residents of Australian
   cities and towns understood nature in this period, and how their
   understandings may have changed in the face of such far-reaching
   developments. A focus on relationships between people, plants and
   invertebrates in home garden settings provides one window onto this
   issue, providing evidence of how those who gardened negotiated a more or
   less self-conscious engagement with `nature' in a domestic setting.
   Close examination of texts produced by and for gardeners suggests that
   while the dominant social construction of the relationship between
   nature and humans increasingly emphasised human autonomy and control,
   the embodied experience of home gardening gave rise to diverse
   understandings. The sense of control and independence that many
   gardeners had come to expect by the 1950s was challenged by the enduring
   autonomy of nature, and many gardeners accepted the limitations of their
   control. Home gardening thus both reflected and challenged prevailing
   modernist ideas about emancipation from nature.},

Abstract = {Mushere children's ethno-ornithology was surveyed from October to
   November 2015 to find out their level of bird knowledge-as well as
   whether and how children valued and learned about birds-in order to
   determine the potential role such knowledge might play in Mushere
   biodiversity conservation. Methods included picture elicitation
   exercises, free-listing, and semi-structured interviews. Our results
   revealed a limited knowledge of birds in Mushere children, and that bird
   knowledge was gendered. Girls learned through observation, while boys
   learned through practical bird-related activities. Learning was mostly
   horizontal for boys but vertical and/or oblique for girls; the most
   reported learning mode was through oral tradition. Farmland and garden
   birds were the most common groups, with birds in the families Columbidae
   and Estrildidae having the highest salience and frequency of mention. We
   suggest that this reflects the importance of ecological salience, since
   both groups are relatively locally abundant. The children also had a
   limited knowledge of cultural beliefs and uses of the birds, but valued
   birds as important. We argue that how much children will know and learn
   about any biological domain will be determined by the cultural attitudes
   and perceptions of that domain, and the cultural importance attached to
   it. We conclude that the limited knowledge of birds in Mushere children
   reflects Mushere cultural indifference (ornithoapatheia) to birds. We
   suggest that a consistent and deliberate conservation education program
   that will work towards encouraging ornithophilia, the love of birds, and
   biophilia, the love of nature, in Mushere children could be beneficial.},

Abstract = {Urban small water bodies, such as ponds, are essential elements of human
   socio-economic landscapes. Ponds also provide important habitats for
   species that would otherwise not survive in the urban environment.
   Knowledge on the biodiversity of urban ponds and the relationship
   between their ecological value and factors linked to urbanization and
   socio-economic status is crucial for decisions on where and how to
   establish and manage ponds in cities to deliver maximum biodiversity
   benefits. Our study investigates if the pattern of urban-pond
   biodiversity can be related to different socio-economic factors, such as
   level of wealth, education or percentage of buildings of different
   types. Because of lack of previous studies investigating that, our study
   is of exploratory character and many different variables are used. We
   found that the biodiversity of aquatic insects was significantly
   negatively associated with urbanisation variables such as amount of
   buildings and number of residents living around ponds. This relationship
   did not differ depending on the spatial scale of our investigation. In
   contrast, we did not find a significant relationship with variables
   representing socio-economic status, such as education level and wealth
   of people. This latter result suggests that the socio-economic status of
   residents does not lead to any particular effect in terms of the
   management and function of ponds that would affect biodiversity.
   However, there is a need for a finer-scale investigation of the
   different potential mechanism in which residents in areas with differing
   socio-economic status could indirectly influence ponds.},

Abstract = {Native grasses act as host plants, providing food and shelter, for
   numerous Lepidoptera species during their larval stage. As grassland
   habitat decreases because of conversion to agriculture and urban areas,
   prairie specialist butterflies and moths have also declined. Addition of
   native species to urban and agriculture landscapes has been shown to
   benefit Lepidoptera communities in various ways. Native grasses have
   grown in popularity as a landscaping plant due to their low nutrient
   requirements, drought tolerance, and soil stabilization properties.
   However, the benefits of native grasses to Lepidoptera are not well
   known to many entomologists or horticulturists, let alone the average
   consumer. We reviewed the literature that identified native prairie
   graminoids as host plants for native Lepidoptera in Minnesota,
   especially plants widely available in the horticultural trade that could
   be planted for restoration or landscaping purposes. The context of the
   Lepidoptera and host plant associations found in the literature are
   described. In total, we found 36 Lepidoptera species that used 17
   prairie graminoids as host plants cited in the literature. Three native
   grasses, Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash, Andropogon gerardii
   Vitman and Panicum virgatum L. and were found to be used by the most
   Lepidoptera species, 11, 9, and 8, respectively. Most likely there are
   additional moth species that use these grasses as host plants because
   butterfly species tend to be better documented than moth species. The
   specific larval habits and host plant species were unknown for many
   species of moths that feed or are suspected to feed on graminoids,
   showing the need for further research in this area. This information can
   assist horticulturalists, ecologists, landscape planners, land managers,
   and homeowners in their decisions to buy and plant native grass species.
   In general, this knowledge provides increased awareness about the larval
   life stage of butterflies and moths to concerned citizens and green

Title = {Short-term social memory deficits in adult female mice exposed to

Abstract = {The accumulated organic residues in tannery-plant courtyards are an
   eating attraction to small rodents; however, the contact of these
   animals with these residues may change their social behavior. Thus, the
   aim of the present study is to investigate whether the exposure to
   tannery effluent (TE) can damage the social recognition memory of female
   Swiss mice, as well as to assess whether vitamin C supplementation could
   provide information about how TE constituents can damage these animals'
   memory. We have observed that resident females exposed to TE (without
   vitamin supplementation) did not explore the anogenital region, their
   body or chased intruding females for shorter time or with lower
   frequency during the retest session of the social recognition test, fact
   that indicates social recognition memory deficit in these animals. Such
   finding is reinforced by the confirmation that there was no change in
   the animals' olfactory function during the buried food test, or
   locomotor changes in females exposed to the pollutant. Since no
   behavioral change was observed in the females exposed to TE and treated
   with vitamin C (before or after the exposure), it is possible saying
   that these social cognitive impairments seem to be directly related to
   the imbalance between the cellular production of reactive oxygen species
   and the counteracting antioxidant mechanisms (oxidative stress) in
   female mice exposed to the pollutant (without vitamin supplementation).
   Therefore, the present study evidences that the direct contact with
   tannery effluent, even for a short period-of-time, may cause short-term
   social memory deficits in adult female Swiss mice. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {The importance of plants to peoples of the circumpolar North is often
   overlooked by non-residents. This oversight stems partly from
   perceptions of northern diets as exclusively meat-and fish-based and
   from a tendency for visiting researchers to assign plants to categories
   of utility-edible, medicinal, material-without also considering complex
   relationships between plants and culture. This paper focuses on the
   ``sea of relationships'' (Cajete 2000: 178) between plants and fishing
   in the Inuit Community of Makkovik, where plant mentors teach how plants
   are integrated into cultural practices and day-to-day life. We looked to
   Indigenous methodologies for guidance in developing research questions,
   learning about plants through story and practice, and understanding and
   communicating collective knowledge. Makkovimiut plant mentors
   collectively tell a story of plants and fishing, illustrated in this
   paper by Makkovimiut artist Aunt Nellie Winters through her Inukuluk
   drawings. These oral and visual stories describe plants as part of a
   large network of relationships connecting trees, fish, birds, soil,
   berries, and people. Similarly, cultural practices are connected to each
   other; fishing is connected to berry picking, sharing, traveling,
   gardening, and celebrating, among other practices. Indigenous
   methodologies, with their focus on relationships, encourage us to seek
   connections between people and plants, and broaden our understanding of
   utility and value. Thinking of plants in relation-connected to
   everything in an active web of relationships-helps us recognize plants
   as vital facilitators of cultural practices, values, and community
   well-being and offers insights into the different kinds of relationships
   we might cultivate within this interconnected},

Abstract = {The pet trade has been responsible for many introductions of non-native
   species. Freshwater ornamental plants and animals originating from the
   pet trade are stocked to garden ponds. The present survey focused on
   awareness and responsible behaviour related to biological invasion risks
   of companies that designed, built, and stocked garden ponds. A
   representative number (n=124) of companies (commercial garden pond
   architects and builders) in the Czech Republic were surveyed regarding
   the offer of non-native, invasive and threatened native species. The
   survey was conducted over the entire warm period (from 1 May 2015 to 31
   September 2015) while using personal visits, correspondence and
   interviews to list the species on offer. Traditional' ornamental species
   were offered by 39.1\% of surveyed vendors, non-traditional marginal'
   species by 5.6\%, common native species by 6.5\% and threatened native
   species by 2.4\%. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that
   garden pond' vendors offer non-native species with a risk of biological
   invasion; moreover, threatened native animals were also on sale. It is
   probable that a similar situation exists in other countries. It is
   important for the conservation of native aquatic biota to raise
   awareness of the need to reduce risk through responsible behaviour of
   those involved in the pet trade. It is also essential to prohibit
   stocking of potential invaders and to enforce the illegal capture and
   sale of native species.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {Investigations of gut microbiomes have shed light on the diversity and
   genetic content of these communities, and helped shape our understanding
   of how host-associated microorganisms influence host physiology,
   behavior, and health. Despite the importance of gut microbes to
   metazoans, our understanding of the changes in diversity and composition
   across the alimentary tract, and the source of the resident community
   are limited. Here, using community metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene
   sequencing, we assess microbial community diversity and coding potential
   in the foregut, midgut, and hindgut of a juvenile Panchlora cockroach,
   which resides in the refuse piles of the leaf-cutter ant species Atta
   colombica. We found a significant shift in the microbial community
   structure and coding potential throughout the three gut sections of
   Panchlora sp., and through comparison with previously generated
   metagenomes of the cockroach's food source and niche, we reveal that
   this shift in microbial community composition is influenced by the
   ecosystems in which Panchlora sp. occurs. While the foregut is composed
   of microbes that likely originate from the symbiotic fungus gardens of
   the ants, the midgut and hindgut are composed of a microbial community
   that is likely cockroach-specific. Analogous to mammalian systems, the
   midgut and hindgut appear to be dominated by Firmicutes and
   Bacteroidetes with the capacity for polysaccharide degradation,
   suggesting they may assist in the degradation of dietary plant material.
   Our work underscores the prominence of community changes throughout gut
   microbiomes and highlights ecological factors that underpin the
   structure and function of the symbiotic microbial communities of
   metazoans.},

Abstract = {To accommodate a migratory life history, migrants express a greater
   number of physiological and behavioral stages per annum than residents
   and are thus considered to have higher finite state diversity (FSD). To
   investigate the physiological mechanisms and constraints associated with
   migration, direct comparison of two subspecies of white-crowned
   sparrow-migrant, Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii, and resident, Z. l.
   nuttalli -were made under common garden conditions of photoperiod and
   housing, as birds progressed from winter through the vernal life history
   stages. We tested the hypothesis that migrants (higher FSD) respond
   differently than residents (lower FSD) to the initial predictive cue,
   photoperiod, to initiate and integrate the progression of vernal stages
   of prenuptial molt, migration and development of breeding. If
   differences in vernal phenology were noted, then the basis for the
   distinctions was considered genetic. Results indicate that (1) residents
   had a lower threshold to vernal photoperiod with elevations of plasma
   androgen, growth and development of reproductive structures preceding
   those of migrants; (2) only migrants displayed prenuptial molt,
   preparations for migration and migratory restlessness; and (3) neither
   baseline nor stress-induced plasma corticosterone differed across
   subspecies, suggesting energetic demands of the common garden were
   insufficient to induce a differential adrenocortical response in either
   subspecies, highlighting the impact of environmental conditions on
   corticosterone secretion. Thus, in a common garden experiment, Z. l.
   gambelii responds differently to the initial predictive cue,
   photoperiod, to initiate and execute the vernal stages of molt,
   migration and development of breeding in comparison to the shared stage
   of breeding with Z. l. nuttalli, confirming a genetic basis for the
   subspecies differences.},

Abstract = {As Midwestern (United States) cities experience population decline,
   there is growing interest in converting underutilized vacant spaces to
   agricultural production. Urban agriculture varies in area and scope, yet
   most growers use similar cultivation practices such as avoiding chemical
   control of crop pests. For community gardens and farms that sell produce
   commercially, effective pest suppression by natural enemies is important
   for both societal, economic, and marketing reasons. To gauge the amount
   of prey suppression at 28 urban food production sites, we measured
   removal of sentinel eggs and larvae of the cabbage looper Trichoplusia
   ni (Hubner), a caterpillar pest that defoliates Brassica. We
   investigated how landscape and local factors, such as scale of
   production, influence cabbage looper mortality caused by predators.
   Predators removed 50\% of eggs and 25\% of larvae over a 3-d period.
   Landscape factors did not predict mortality rates, and the amount of
   loss and damage to sentinel prey were similar across sites that differed
   in scale (residential gardens, community gardens, and farms). To confirm
   that removal of sentinel items was likely caused by natural enemies, we
   set up a laboratory assay that measured predation of cabbage looper eggs
   and larvae by several predators occurring in urban gardens. Lady beetles
   caused the highest mortality rates, suggesting their potential value for
   biocontrol; spiders and pirate bugs also consumed both eggs and larvae
   at high rates. Our results suggest that urban growers benefit from high
   consumption rates of cabbage looper eggs and larvae by arthropod
   predators.},

Abstract = {Despite the negative impacts of urbanisation, some species adapt to

   Bycanistes bucinator are a large avian forest frugivore that uses urban
   environments in South Africa. Consequently, we used GPS/UHF transmitters
   to study their home range size, movement and habitat use in an
   urban-forest mosaic in Eshowe, South Africa from March to October 2014.
   We estimated the home range size using three methods: minimum convex
   polygon (MCP), kernel density estimation (KDE) and local convex hull
   (LoCoH). Our results showed that overall monthly home range size was 5.1
   +/- 1.28 km(2) (mean +/- SE; 95\% MCP), 4.6 +/- 1.14 km(2) (95\% KDE)
   and 1.9 +/- 0. 46 km(2) (95\% LoCoH). However, individual home range
   sizes varied monthly and seasonally. We found that all individuals
   tagged used mostly the indigenous forest and frequently utilised urban
   residential areas (gardens) with little or no use of cultivated land.
   Observed individual variations in monthly and seasonal home ranges could
   be a response to variations in availability of key fruit resources in
   the urban residential and indigenous forest mosaic. This study supports
   the use of more than one method of home range estimation for insight

   queen fecundity and death of all resident queens in over 60\% of the

Title = {Maintaining experiences of nature as a city grows},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Experiences of nature contribute to human health and well-being, yet as
   the world's population continues to concentrate in towns and cities
   there is mounting concern that these experiences are diminishing.
   Despite this, little is known about how we can maintain experiences of
   nature as cities grow. Here, we quantify how people's opportunities to
   experience nature might change with future urban growth in the city of
   Brisbane, Australia. We simulated the addition of 84,642 houses under
   compact and sprawling growth scenarios and modeled changes in people's
   opportunities to experience nature by estimating changes in backyard
   size, public green space provision, and bird species richness close to
   households. We discovered that the form of urban growth could strongly
   influence people's opportunities to experience nature in a way that is
   highly nonrandom across the socioeconomic gradient. Under a sprawling
   pattern of development, with low residential densities and few
   interstitial green spaces, our models suggest severe declines in access
   to public green space and bird species richness around people's homes.
   These declines are predicted to be concentrated in socioeconomically
   disadvantaged areas of the city. Compact development leads to greater
   reductions in backyard size, but smaller declines in access to public
   green space and bird species richness. Our results point to a difficult
   trade-off; residential infill will maintain larger green spaces and
   higher overall bird diversity but reduce backyard sizes, impacting
   people's opportunities to experience nature in a different way. Careful
   planning is needed to balance the availability of public and private
   urban green spaces to ensure that the opportunities for people to
   experience nature are maintained as urbanization continues.},

Abstract = {Studies of Zugunruhe - the migratory restlessness' behaviour of captive
   birds - have been integral to our understanding of animal migration,
   revealing an inherited propensity to migrate and an endogenous timing
   and navigation system. However, differences between Zugunruhe in
   captivity and migration in the wild call for more data, in particular on
   variation within and among taxa with diverse migration strategies. Here,
   we characterise Zugunruhe in a long-term dataset of activity profiles
   from stonechats (genus Saxicola) with diverse migratory phenotypes (976
   migration periods from 414 birds), using a flexible and consistent
   quantitative approach based on changepoint analysis. For east African,
   Austrian, Irish, and Siberian stonechats and hybrids, we report key
   inter-population differences in the occurrence, timing, and intensity of
   Zugunruhe. In line with expectations, we found the highest Zugunruhe
   intensity in the longest-distance migrants, more variable patterns in
   short-distance migrants, and intermediate characteristics of hybrids
   relative to their parental groups. Inter-population differences imply
   high evolutionary lability of Zugunruhe timing within a robustly
   structured annual cycle. However, counter to theory, Irish partial
   migrants showed no segregation between migrant and resident individuals,
   and previously reported nocturnal restlessness was confirmed for
   resident African stonechats. Further features of nocturnal restlessness
   that did not align with migratory behaviour of stonechats were juvenile
   nocturnal restlessness even prior to postjuvenile moult, and protandry
   in spring, although stonechats winter in heterosexual pairs.
   Importantly, Zugunruhe of all populations declined with age, and the
   intensity of an individual bird's Zugunruhe was correlated with activity
   levels during other parts of the annual cycle. Our results confirm
   endogenous, population-specific migration programmes but also reveal
   apparent discrepancies between Zugunruhe and migration in the wild. We
   thus highlight both the continued potential of Zugunruhe study and the
   need for circumspect interpretation when using migratory restlessness to
   make inferences about migration in the wild.},

Title = {Forest gardens - new opportunities for urban children to understand and
   develop relationships with other organisms},

Abstract = {This case study explores a learning situation in a forest garden in
   Sweden. A forest garden is an edible polyculture landscape with
   different layers of mostly perennial vegetation. The forest garden is
   designed to maximize the yield of useful plants while minimizing the
   input of energy and resources, including human labour. Forest gardens
   may offer learning situations that contextualize interconnectedness and
   relations between organisms as well as situations that are beneficial
   for evaluative development (Keller t, 2002), i.e. the development of
   values, beliefs and moral perspectives in children.
   Twenty-seven seven to eight year old primary school children were
   followed in the first six months of a three year project in which they
   participated in developing a forest garden.
   The aim of the study is to investigate how the children reason with
   respect to different organisms' dependence on and relations to each
   other, themselves included. Specifically: How do the children describe
   their own relationships with other organisms, as well as the
   relationships between other organisms in the forest garden?
   What values of nature are expressed by the children, and in relation to
   which situations in the forest garden? Data were collected in the form
   of field notes, audio and video recordings and photos from the
   children's visits to the forest garden. The photos were used for
   stimulated recall in focus group interviews. The data were analysed
   using a combination of qualitative content analysis (Patton, 2002) and
   semi-quantitative methods.
   The children in the study presented a unidirectional perspective about
   the relationship between themselves and the organisms, especially the
   insects, in the forest garden. Rather than asking what these organisms
   can do for me/us, they pose the question: What can I/we do for the
   bugs/plants/ bees?
   The humanistic values, expressed by the children as a willingness to
   help other organisms (mostly insects) are in line with the explicit aims
   of the former curriculum for Biology to ``promote care and respect for
   nature{''}. We should note that these humanistic values are no longer
   explicitly stated in the current curriculum. It is striking that the
   anthropocentric ecosystem services perspective (introduced in the
   current curriculum from grade 4), is so rare in the data. The children
   seldom mentioned the benefits for humans from insect pollination, even
   though this relationship is clearly stated by the pedagogues together
   with humanistic values.
   In observations, the children showed a great deal of curiosity for the
   natural environment (naturalistic value) as well as joy and enthusiasm
   about participating in the different activities that took place in the
   forest garden. Aesthetic values were expressed in relation to flowers,
   cones, berries, a snail's shell etc. This study shows that forest
   gardens have the potential to be places where children can connect
   emotionally and cognitively to other organisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Abstract = {Private residential property occupies a major part of the urban land
   base, yet considerable potential remains for improving the ecological
   performance of private gardens and landscapes. Ecologically-oriented
   approaches to design of residential properties, however, are only
   valuable if they are compatible with private landowner interests and
   needs-otherwise they may never be implemented. Landscape designers would
   benefit from more comprehensive guidance for ecologically-oriented
   planting design that best fits within residential settings. This paper
   identifies plant-based design strategies that may improve avian species
   richness, reviews scientific literature supporting these options, and
   describes three years of structured design research to evaluate how
   these strategies can be compatible with the programmatic and aesthetic
   goals of residential landowners. We worked with three New York State
   communities beginning with a community/neighborhood-scale visioning and
   goal setting process and ending with parcel-scale landscape designs. The
   project, in total, developed residential landscape designs for 50
   private properties, each incorporating urban ecological benefits in
   combination with the interests and needs of the owner. We share here a
   set of planting design strategies for enhancing avian habitat on
   residential private property generated during this process. They include
   planting strategies that: a) contribute to landscape networks; b) build
   vegetative structure at sites; c) provide microrefugia; d) optimize
   forage resource availability; and e) enhance plant diversity.
   Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of design results for the
   strategies is discussed.},

Abstract = {What happens when an exotic herbivore invades and encounters novel host
   plants and enemies? Here, we investigate the impacts of host plant
   quality and plant architecture on an exotic generalist herbivore,
   Epiphyas postvittana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and its interactions
   with resident parasitoids in California. Using artificial diet and five
   plant species, we found significant effects of diet on the fitness of E.
   postvittana under laboratory conditions. In the field, based on a common
   garden experiment with host plants of nine species, we found that larval
   parasitism varied among plant species by a factor of 2.1 with a higher
   risk of parasitism on shorter than taller plants. Parasitism of egg
   masses varied by a factor of 4.7 among plant species with a higher risk
   of parasitism on taller than shorter plants. In the laboratory, the
   foraging time of a resident egg parasitoid on excised leaves varied
   among plant species, but did not correspond to observed egg parasitism
   rates on these same plants in the field. On leaves of Plantago
   lanceolata, the probability of egg parasitism decreased with trichome
   density. Overall, there was a significant effect of host plant on the
   intrinsic rate of increase of E. postvittana and on the extent of
   parasitism by resident parasitoids, but no correlation existed between
   these two effects. The recent decline of E. postvittana in California
   may be due to the low quality of some host plants and to the many
   resident enemies that readily attack it, perhaps due to its phylogenetic
   relatedness to resident tortricids.},

Abstract = {Variation in densities of native and exotic urban-adapted birds across
   suburban habitats may reveal levels of adaptation that predict
   vulnerability to habitat modification over time. We investigated the
   densities of the eight most common exotic and native birds in a southern
   hemisphere city across suburbs of varying housing density, vegetative
   cover and garden vegetation characteristics to determine whether avian
   population densities are maintained across variations in habitat
   structure that mirror current temporal trends in land use and
   landscaping/gardening preferences. We also tested whether densities of
   birds in residential areas bordering undeveloped patches were higher due
   to spill-over from patches. Densities of all four native species were
   highest in undeveloped patches and these species were largely absent
   from high density housing areas. While densities of two exotic species
   (blackbird, song thrush) were slightly higher in suburbs with greater
   vegetation complexity, they were still present in higher density housing
   suburbs in significant numbers. Common starlings were similarly abundant
   across all residential habitats and house sparrow density increased in
   higher density housing areas. Blackbirds appeared least vulnerable to
   housing densification and landscaping and gardening trends because they
   were abundant across all habitats, including undeveloped patches.
   Densities of native birds were higher in residential areas bordering
   undeveloped patches indicating spill-over was occurring and emphasising
   the role that patches could play in boosting city-wide native bird
   abundances. Native birds are vulnerable to reductions in garden size and
   vegetation complexity that should have little or positive effects on
   populations of common exotic species.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the information
   pregnant women received regarding possible exposures to five recognized
   reprotoxic agents during their pregnancy.
   Study design: A cohort study was conducted using two postnatal units in
   France. Women hospitalized in postnatal units were requested to complete
   a self-administered two part questionnaire. The first part gathered
   information about the patient's socio-professional level and the type of
   pregnancy follow-up. The second part examined the information the
   patient received regarding daily products containing the following known
   reprotoxic agents: bisphenol A, toluene, n-hexane,
   cis-chloroallyl-triaza-azonia-adamantane-chloride and O-phenyl-phenol.
   The women cited the sources of information. We combined the employment
   status and educational level to separate the women into two groups. The
   groups were then compared using the Chi Square test or Fisher's exact
   test.
   Result(s): There were 390 women in this study. Our results showed the
   women received information regarding the following: 21.6\% (n=84)
   regarding tin cans, 21.9\% (n =85) concerning plastic meal boxes when
   heated in microwave ovens, 8.8\% (n=32) about water in gas-bottles,
   27.4\% (n=106) about non organic foods, 39.3\% (n= 152) about hair dyes,
   17\% (n = 66) about nail polishes, 23.4\% (n =103) about insect
   repellents, 34.4\% (n=133) about ``do-it-yourself{''} products, 2.1\%
   (n=8) about gardening products, 26.7\% (n=103) about electric plug-in
   repellents, 21.1\% (n= 81) about housekeeping products, and 6.8\% (n=
   26) about register receipts. Women with a higher level of education and
   a qualified occupation were better informed about these daily products.
   These women were more likely to learn the information on their own
   (internet, media).
   Conclusion(s): Our study showed French women did not receive sufficient
   information regarding potential exposures to reprotoxic agents during
   pregnancy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {118},
Number = {3},
Pages = {624-639},

Abstract = {Bird-window collisions at houses have been identified as a significant
   source of mortality for North American birds, but which types of houses
   and windows are most problematic remains poorly understood. We assessed
   how neighborhood type, yard conditions, house attributes, and window
   type influenced collision rates. Data were collected from citizen
   scientists across Alberta, Canada, who surveyed their houses daily. In
   relation to the best-fitting model, the yard model explained 58.1\% of
   the explained deviance, the neighborhood model 45.6\%, and the house
   model 42.6\%. The factors that had the largest effect for predicting
   collision risk included season and whether the house was in a rural or
   an urban area (rural areas in the fall had a 6.0x higher collision risk
   than urban areas in the winter), the height of vegetation in the front
   yard of the house (trees >2 stories high increased collision risk by
   3.6x compared to houses with no trees), and the presence of a bird
   feeder (which increased collision risk by 1.73). This suggests that
   multiple factors affect collision rates and that the suitability of a
   yard as bird habitat is likely a key driver. Given that few homeowners
   are likely to take an approach that reduces the number of birds in their
   yards, future focus needs to be given to bird-friendly urban design and
   developing the most effective window deterrents so that collisions can
   be reduced and birds enjoyed in urban environments.},

Abstract = {Active ingredients in residential and agricultural insecticides have
   changed over time, due in part to regulatory restrictions. Few studies
   have evaluated how changes in active ingredients have impacted
   insecticide levels measured in.homes. We measured concentrations of
   insecticides in one carpet dust sample from each of 434 homes in
   California from 2001 to 2006. Analytes included four insecticides sold
   for indoor home use during our study period (carbaryl, cypermethrin,
   permethrin, and propoxur) and four that are no longer sold for indoor
   use including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethylene (DDT, removed from the
   market in 1972), chlordane (1988), chlorpyrifos (2001), and diazinon
   (2004). We considered other potential determinants of concentrations of
   insecticides in carpet dust, such as home and garden use, occupational
   exposure; and nearby agricultural applications. We calculated the
   percentage change in the concentration of each insecticide per year,
   adjusting for significant determinants. In adjusted models,
   concentrations of insecticides in carpet dust decreased for three of
   four insecticides no longer sold for residential use: chlordane (-15\%
   per year), chlorpyrifos (-31\%), diazinon (-48\%), and propoxur (-34\%),
   which is currently sold for residential use but with increased
   restrictions since 1997. Concentrations of other insecticides sold for
   indoor use (carbaryl, cypermethrin, and permethrin) and DDT did not

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {The value of urban biodiversity is increasingly emphasised from both
   social and ecological perspectives, as biodiversity has been linked to
   providing multiple benefits ranging from supporting city sustainability
   to enhancing the health and well-being of individual residents. At
   present many urban studies lack integrated methods of assessing urban
   biodiversity that would allow the capture of both social and ecological
   values of green space and enable better management and planning for
   urban biodiversity. Here we introduce a method of scoring urban habitats
   at a fine scale, which measures habitat attributes that act as
   biodiversity indicators common to both social and ecological fields.
   This provides a single, comparable score that represents the capacity of
   habitats to support biodiversity and people's connection to that
   biodiversity. Our results show a clear ranking of urban spaces from
   those characterised as being wilder and greener, to those dominated by
   paved surfaces that are more highly managed. We applied this scoring
   approach to predict and compare biodiversity across neighbourhoods in
   three New Zealand cities. We found biodiversity across neighbourhoods
   was significantly related to socioeconomic class, due mainly to the
   greater cover of mature gardens of high biodiversity value in regions of
   higher socioeconomic status. As such, while all neighbourhoods provided
   opportunities for residents to connect to nature through public green
   space, those people living in more deprived neighbourhoods are less
   likely to be exposed to nearby biodiverse spaces, and therefore may
   encounter fewer opportunities to connect to nature and gain the benefits
   which urban biodiversity can afford. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Potential ecosystem service delivery by endemic plants in New Zealand
   vineyards: successes and prospects},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {Vineyards worldwide occupy over 7 million hectares and are typically
   virtual mono-cultures, with high and costly inputs of water and
   agro-chemicals, Understanding and enhancing ecosystem services can
   reduce inputs and their costs and help satisfy market demands for
   evidence of more sustainable practices. In this New Zealand work,
   low-growing, endemic plant species were evaluated for their potential
   benefits as Service Providing Units (SPUs) or Ecosystem Service
   Providers (ESPs), The services provided were weed suppression,
   conservation of beneficial invertebrates, soil moisture retention and
   microbial activity. The potential Ecosystem Dis-services (EDS) from the
   selected plant species by hosting the larvae of a key vine moth pest,
   the light brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana), was also quantified.
   Questionnaires were used to evaluate winegrowers' perceptions of the
   value of and problems associated with such endemic plant species in
   their vineyards. Growth and survival rates of the 14 plant species, in
   eight families, were evaluated, with Leptinella dioica (Asteraceae) and
   Acaena inermis `purpurea' (Rosaceae) having the highest growth rates in
   terms of area covered and the highest survival rate after 12 months. All
   14 plant species suppressed weeds, with Leptinella squalida, Geranium
   sessiliforum (Geraniaceae), Hebe chathamica (Plantaginaceae),
   Scleranthus uniflorus (Caryophyllaceae) and L. dioica, each reducing
   weed cover by >95\%. Plant species also differed in the diversity of
   arthropods that they supported, with the Shannon Wiener diversity index
   (H') for these taxa ranging from 0 to 1.3. G. sessiliforum and
   Muehlenbeckia axillaris (Polygonaceae) had the highest invertebrate
   diversity. Density of spiders was correlated with arthropod diversity
   and G. sessiliflorum and H. chathamica had the highest densities of
   these arthropods. Several plant species associated with higher soil
   moisture content than in control plots. The best performing species in
   this context were A, inermis `purpurea' and Lobelia angulata
   (Lobeliaceae). Soil beneath all plant species had a higher microbial
   activity than in control plots, with L. dioica being highest in this
   respect. Survival proportion to the adult stage of the moth pest,. E,
   postvittana, on all plant species was poor (<0.3). When judged by a
   ranking combining multiple criteria, the most promising plant species
   were (in decreasing order) G. sessiliflorum, A. inerrnis `purpurea', H,
   chathamica, axillaris, L. dioica, L, angulata, L. squalida and S.
   uniflorus. Winegrowers surveyed said that they probably would deploy
   endemic plants around their vines. This research demonstrates that
   enhancing plant diversity in vineyards can deliver SPUs, harbour ESPs
   and therefore deliver ES. The data also shows that growers are willing
   to follow these protocols, with appropriate advice founded on sound
   research.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},

Volume = {198},

Abstract = {Large carnivorous mammals, such as the gray wolf (Canis lupus) have been
   recently expanding to human dominated landscapes in many regions.
   Although wolves tend to avoid human infrastructure, visitations close to
   human residences might be unavoidable in territories that are highly
   fragmented by residential areas. House yard visits are of particular
   concern: according to the Finnish legislation, wolves that repeatedly
   approach within 150 m from the nearest residential building can legally
   be killed for human safety. We analyzed the average distance from house
   yards and probability of house yard visitations by wolves against sex,
   age class, time of the day, season and house density for 25 territorial
   GPS-tracked wolves in Finland. Generally, wolves avoid houses with mean
   distances higher than from random locations in the territory. This
   difference became higher with decreasing house density for sub-adults
   while for adults this difference decreased slightly with decreasing
   house density. Probability of visitation in house-yards increased with
   increasing house densities, was far higher at night than in the daytime,
   a difference that was greater with increasing house density. Sub-adults
   visited house-yards more often than adult wolves in the first summer
   after spring dispersal from the natal pack to a territory, but there was
   no difference in winter. The indication that wolves learn within a
   season to avoid moving to near residential buildings in human-dominated
   territories is when the territory becomes more familiar to wolves which
   is a noteworthy result for the management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Peridomestic ({''}backyard{''}) chicken flocks are gaining popularity in
   the developed world (e.g., North America or Europe), yet little is known
   regarding prevalence or severity of their ectoparasites. Therefore, five
   birds on each of 20 properties throughout southern California were
   surveyed in summer for on-host (permanent) and off-host dwelling
   (temporary) ectoparasites. Only four premises (20\%) were entirely free
   of ectoparasites. In declining order of prevalence (\% of premises),
   permanent ectoparasites included six chicken louse species: Menacanthus
   stramineus (Nitzsch) (50\%), Goniocotes gallinae (De Geer) (35\%),
   Lipeurus caponis (L.) (20\%), Menopon gallinae (L.) (15\%), Menacanthus
   cornutus (Schommer) (5\%), and Cuclotogaster heterographus (Nitzsch)
   (5\%). Only one flea species, Echidnophaga gallinacea (Westwood) (20\%),
   was found. Three parasitic mite species were observed: Ornithonyssus
   sylviarum (Canestrini \& Fanzago) (15\%), Knemidocoptes mutans (Robin \&
   Lanquetin) (10\%), and Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer) (5\%). Many
   infestations consisted of a few to a dozen individuals per bird, but M.
   stramineus, G. gallinae, M. cornutus, and E. gallinacea were abundant
   (dozens to hundreds of individuals) on some birds, and damage by K.
   mutans was severe on two premises. Off-host dwelling ectoparasites were
   rare (D. gallinae) or absent (Cimex lectularius L., Argasidae). Parasite
   diversity in peridomestic flocks greatly exceeds that is routinely
   observed on commercial chicken flocks and highlights a need for
   increased biosecurity and development of ectoparasite control options
   for homeowners.},

Title = {Reproductive Allochrony in Seasonally Sympatric Populations Maintained

Abstract = {Reproductive allochrony presents a potential barrier to gene flow and is
   common in seasonally sympatric migratory and sedentary birds. Mechanisms
   mediating reproductive allochrony can influence population divergence
   and the capacity of populations to respond to environmental change. We
   asked whether reproductive allochrony in seasonally sympatric birds
   results from a difference in response to supplementary or photoperiodic
   cues and whether the response varies in relation to the distance
   separating breeding and wintering locations as measured by stable
   isotopes. We held seasonally sympatric migratory and sedentary male
   dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) in a common garden in early spring
   under simulated natural changes in photoperiod and made measurements of
   reproductive and migratory physiology. On the same dates and
   photoperiods, sedentary juncos had higher testosterone (initial and
   gonadotropin-releasing hormone induced), more developed cloacal
   protuberances, and larger testes than migrants. In contrast, migratory
   juncos had larger fat reserves (fuel for migration). We found a negative
   relationship between testis mass and feather hydrogen isotope ratios,
   indicating that testis growth was more delayed in migrants making longer
   migrations. We conclude that reproductive allochrony in seasonally
   sympatric migratory and sedentary birds can result from a differential
   response to photoperiodic cues in a common garden, and as a result, gene
   flow between migrants and residents may be reduced by photoperiodic
   control of reproductive development. Further, earlier breeding in
   response to future climate change may currently be constrained by
   differential response to photoperiodic cues.},

Title = {Social and environmental factors drive variation in plant and bird

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {210-222},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {We examined whether environmental or social factors alone, or a
   combination of social ecological factors were more effective at
   explaining patterns in plant and bird assemblages across urban green
   spaces. Thirty publicly accessible, passive recreation greenspaces
   provided by municipal councils (i.e. city parks) were surveyed in a
   highly urbanised city - Sydney, Australia. Plant communities were
   influenced most by topography and park management approach, and to a
   lesser extent by land-use history. Greenspaces with greater topographic
   variation and that were co-managed with local citizen groups hosted
   higher plant species richness and abundance. Bird species richness
   within greenspaces increased with increasing distance from the central
   business district and decreasing distance from freshwater. Bird
   abundance was best explained by a combination of social-ecological
   factors, with abundance increasing with increasing site (greenspace)
   age, increasing percent concrete groundcover of a site and increasing
   proximity to the central business district. We identified a group of
   `rare city parks', dissimilar in ecological composition that hosted more
   complex and species rich plant communities compared to `common city
   parks'. We suggest this difference is likely because rare city parks
   received management and maintenance input from local citizen groups,
   whereas common city parks were managed and maintained exclusively by
   local councils. How different social factors, such as management
   approach and ongoing maintenance, are linked to the ecology of urban
   greenspaces are key areas for future investigation to help create
   sustainable urban landscapes that provide maximum benefits to urban
   residents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {33-42},

Abstract = {Coastal ponds, due to their proximity to human activity, may be
   particularly vulnerable to invasions by non-native species. A number of
   invasive tunicate species have been documented in several of the coastal
   ponds on the island of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Tunicates are
   voracious filter feeders, thus our study attempted to examine the impact
   of their feeding on the normal food web in a coastal pond. In 2012 and
   2013, we sampled Stonewall (high tunicate abundance) and Lagoon Ponds
   (tunicates absent) on Martha's Vineyard. We used quadrat sampling to
   quantify tunicate abundance, eelgrass shoot density and eelgrass canopy
   height. Fish, invertebrates and aquatic vegetation were collected via
   beach seine, minnow trap, crab traps or by hand. Water samples were run
   through a filter to collect phytoplankton. These biota samples were
   processed for carbon and nitrogen isotopic analysis. Temperature loggers
   were deployed in both ponds to collect water temperature. Detailed
   bathymetric readings were taken to generate an estimate of the volume of
   each pond. Tunicate filtration rates from published scientific
   literature, our volume estimate of Stonewall Pond and our measured
   tunicate abundance were used in a model to estimate the time needed by
   tunicates to filter a volume of water equal to Stonewall Pond. That time
   varied from less than an hour to over 17 hours. Isotopic analysis showed
   that tunicates were feeding on similar resources as the commercial
   shellfish species. There was broad overlap in the isotopic signatures
   between the biota from both ponds, suggesting that tunicates were not
   having a measurable impact to the food web. Tunicates exhibit
   significant seasonal abundance changes, with the peak occurring late
   summer into the early fall. The limited duration of this peak may not be
   sufficient to be reflected in the isotopic signature of resident biota.
   As water temperature continues to increase with climate change, the
   current assemblage of tunicates in these shallow water systems on
   Martha's Vineyard will likely change in response.},

Abstract = {Populations of House and Tree Sparrows have rapidly declined in various
   breeding habitats throughout their European distribution range; however,
   the strongest decline was recorded within urban environments. In our
   study we investigated fine-scale distribution, population densities and
   habitat selection of both sparrow species within a 200 x 200 m squares
   in a medium sized city (Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic) during the
   breeding season. The total population density of House and Tree Sparrow
   was 11.7 and 2.8 individuals/10 ha; however the densities of both
   sparrow species markedly differed among various urban units. The highest
   density of House Sparrow was recorded in residential areas (33.3 ind./10
   ha) and Tree Sparrows were mostly found in garden colonies (10.3 ind./10
   ha). After removing spatial effects, we found that numbers of both
   sparrows were negatively correlated with area of artificial surfaces
   (e.g. pavements, streets, railway networks or parking spaces) and
   positively correlated with area of city green. Built-up area did not
   affect numbers of House Sparrow, but there was a slight negative
   relationship with Tree Sparrow numbers. However, maximum numbers per
   square for both species were found in the areas where city green
   represented ca 50 \% of all habitats. This suggests that mix of built-up
   areas and city green is more important for sparrow numbers than each
   habitat per se. Comparison of use/availability for studied habitat
   reveals that both sparrow species clearly avoided artificial surfaces.
   House Sparrow showed preference for built-up areas and Tree Sparrow
   showed similar preference for built-up areas and city green. Different
   habitat selection can be explained by a combination of different
   requirements for nest sites together with the nutritional needs of
   sparrows during the breeding season. The majority of nest sites were
   located in artificial structures such as roof tiles (80\% for House
   Sparrow and 50\% for Tree Sparrow), followed by nests located in
   crevices and holes on buildings. Both sparrows nested in older
   buildings: 92\% of House Sparrow and 85\% of Tree Sparrow nests were
   situated in buildings older than 30 years, i.e. built before the 1980s.},

Abstract = {The eastern migratory monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus L.) population
   in North America hit record low numbers during the 2013-2014
   overwintering season, prompting pleas by scientists and conservation
   groups to plant the butterfly's milkweed host plants (Asclepias spp.) in
   residential areas. While planting butterfly gardens with host plants
   seems like an intuitive action, no previous study has directly compared
   larval survival in gardens and natural areas to demonstrate that gardens
   are suitable habitats for Lepidoptera. In this study, milkweed was
   planted in residential gardens and natural areas. In 2009 and 2010,
   plants were monitored for oviposition by monarch butterflies and
   survival of monarch eggs and caterpillars. Monarchs oviposited
   significantly more frequently in gardens than in natural sites, with 2.0
   and 6.2 times more eggs per plant per observation in 2009 and 2010,
   respectively. There were no significant differences in overall subadult
   survival between gardens and natural areas. Significant differences in
   survival were measured for egg and larval cohorts when analyzed
   separately, but these were not consistent between years. These results
   suggest that planting gardens with suitable larval host plants can be an
   effective tool for restoring habitat for monarch butterflies. If planted
   over a large area, garden plantings may be useful as a partial
   mitigation for dramatic loss of monarch habitat in agricultural
   settings.},

   Greenspaces},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {141},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Small urban greenspaces, such as neighborhood parks and private gardens,
   have often been overlooked or considered unlikely habitat sources owing
   to their small size, even though they may still provide important
   nesting and food resources for common songbirds. The objective of this
   study was to determine the role of small greenspaces, comprising a
   variety of land-use types, by assessing the distribution and abundance
   of four common songbird species. Point count data collected by the
   Baltimore Ecosystem Study were analyzed for four common urban songbirds:
   American robin (Turdus migratorius), northern cardinal (Cardinalis
   cardinalis), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), and European starling
   (Sturnus vulgaris). Vacant land, small parks, and residential land cover
   within a 200 m radius for each point count location were calculated as a
   proxy for private lawns and gardens,. Abundance modeling was conducted
   to determine which land-cover types best predicted the abundance values
   of each species and the distribution of each species across the city was
   mapped. American robin abundance was positively associated with small
   parks and negatively associated with vacant land, indicating that some
   form of greenspace management might be necessary for American robin use,
   specifically for foraging in short grass or nesting in younger trees.
   European starlings were negatively associated with small parks and had
   the greatest occurrence probability within the densely developed areas
   of downtown Baltimore. Results from this study can inform landscape
   planners of the benefits of certain spatial configurations and land uses
   that could increase urban biodiversity and sustainability. (C) 2015

Abstract = {This study provides a better understanding of the perspective and
   attitudes of farmers towards sustainable land management (SLM) practices
   in central Spain. Farmer's willingness to change from conventional
   tillage to cover crops in vineyards is seen as an indicator for adoption
   of sustainable agriculture. Two complementary approaches were used: open
   interviews (n=25) and surveys (n=64). The portrait of these winegrowers
   is of mature farmers, owners of their lands and conscious of soil
   erosion problems (81\%), although not on their own lands. They observe
   soil degradation (45\%); however, they are more conscious of problems in
   their vines or grapes (64\%). Only 32\% would be willing to use cover
   crops to avoid erosion. The barriers for adoption were mainly related to
   water constraints, lack of knowledge and inability to accept production
   decreases. Results indicate an underlying lack of information on SLM.
   They show confusion or mistakes regarding the relationship between
   tillage and erosion. Young farmers are more prone to change practices.
   Scientific results are not effectively communicated; there are no
   efficient local structures to provide them with knowledge and advice in
   their work, including guidance on environmental issues. The EU
   agri-environment payments cover the costs of SLM practices for avoiding
   erosion or compaction and increasing SOC. In spite of that, participants
   do not apply for subsidies to compensate the income foregone. Policy
   makers, extension services and scientists have to face this situation to
   tackle the limited knowledge transfer revealed in this study. Copyright

Abstract = {In an urban environment, ants can find shelter for the construction of

   this reason, the aim of this study is to know the composition of ant
   communities in urban gardens in the city of Juiz de Fora, southeast
   region of Brazil. Samples were taken from six gardens between November
   2005 and June 2006. We used a consortium of three methodologies: active
   searching, baits and pitfall traps. We collected specimens of 26 genera
   and seven subfamilies. The subfamily Myrmicinae was the most diverse,
   and the genus Wasmannia, was considered the most constant, followed by
   Camponotus and Linepithema. The efficiency index of the methodologies
   demonstrated that active searching was the most efficient (96.15\%)
   methodology. This method is efficient and sufficient for sampling ants
   in urban gardens, since 25 of the 26 genera sampled, presenting seven
   exclusive genera. The green area was not positively correlated with the
   diversity of ant genera in the urban gardens, demonstrating that other

   residential area},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {517},
Pages = {207-214},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Urban runoff can be a significant source of pesticides in urban streams.
   However, quantification of this source has been difficult because
   pesticide use by urban residents (e.g., on pavements or in gardens) is
   often unknown, particularly at the scale of a residential catchment.
   Proper quantification and characterization of pesticide loss via urban
   runoff require sound information on the use and occurrence of pesticides
   at hydrologically-relevant spatial scales, involving various
   hydrological conditions. We conducted a monitoring study in a
   residential area (9.5 ha, Flanders, Belgium) to investigate the use and
   loss of a widely-used herbicide (glyphosate) and its major degradation
   product (aminomethylphosphonic acid, AMPA). The study covered 13
   rainfall events over 67 days. Overall, less than 0.5\% of glyphosate
   applied was recovered from the storm drain outflow in the catchment.
   Maximum detected concentrations were 6.1 mu g/L and 5.8 mu g/L for
   glyphosate and AMPA, respectively, both of which are below the predicted
   no-effect concentration for surface water proposed by the Flemish
   environmental agency (10 mu g/L), but are above the EU drinking water
   standard (0.1 mu g/L). The measured concentrations and percentage loss
   rates can be attributed partially to the strong sorption capacity of
   glyphosate and low runoff potential in the study area. However,
   glyphosate loss varied considerably among rainfall events and event load
   of glyphosate mass was mainly controlled by rainfall amount, according
   to further statistical analyses. To obtain urban pesticide management
   insights, robust tools are required to investigate the loss and
   occurrence of pesticides influenced by various factors, particularly the
   hydrological and spatial factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {As our world becomes increasingly urbanized, cities are often where we
   come into contact with the natural world-not just in parks and urban
   nature preserves, but in more familiar places like residential yards. We
   conducted bird surveys and social surveys in Chicago-area residential
   landscapes near forest preserves (primarily in middle- and high-income
   areas) to examine residents' perceptions of the birds that co-inhabit
   their neighborhoods and the relationship of those perceptions with
   characteristics of the bird community. We found that residents value
   many aspects of neighborhood birds, especially those related to
   aesthetics and birds' place in the ecosystem. Our results indicate that
   while birds were generally well liked and annoyances were minor, several
   common and visible urban species, such as the House Sparrow (Passer
   domesticus), European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris), and Blue Jay
   (Cyanocitta cristata), may attract attention for their negative
   qualities, such as their sounds and effects on personal property. The
   results also indicate that residents' valuations of ecosystem services
   are linked to their perceptions of bird species richness rather than the
   actual species richness, and people may perceive only a subset of the
   birds in their neighborhoods. Although birds provide many important
   ecosystem services, perhaps one of their most important roles in cities
   is as a relatable and likable connecting point between city dwellers and
   the broader environment.},

Abstract = {1. The spillover of exotic predators from managed ecosystems into
   natural habitats may exacerbate the biodiversity losses caused by
   land-use intensification. 2. In the present study, the impacts of the
   exotic wandering spider Cheiracanthium mildei L.Koch in an oak woodland
   ecosystem adjacent to an intensively-managed agricultural system were
   examined. 3. Abundance and species richness of resident spiders and
   insects in oak branches were reduced in the presence of C. mildei.
   Contrary to expectations, C.mildei did not disproportionately affect
   other wandering spider species, but appeared to impact spiders from all
   tested functional groups. Numbers of herbivorous and predatory insects
   were also lower in the presence of C. mildei. 4. Although the apparent
   effects of this spider extend to multiple trophic levels in oak
   woodland, its voracity and relatively large size may ultimately
   strengthen herbivore suppression in the vineyard-oak woodland landscape.},

Abstract = {Pyrethroid insecticides are widely used on agricultural crops, as well
   as for nurseries, golf courses, urban structural and landscaping sites,
   residential home and garden pest control, and mosquito abatement.
   Evaluation of sensitive marine and estuarine species is essential for
   the development of toxicity testing and risk-assessment protocols. Two
   estuarine crustacean species, Americamysis bahia (mysids) and
   Palaemonetes pugio (grass shrimp), were tested with the commonly used
   pyrethroid compounds, lambda-cyhalothrin, permethrin, cypermethrin,
   deltamethrin, and phenothrin. Sensitivities of adult and larval grass
   shrimp and 7-day-old mysids were compared using standard 96-h LC50
   bioassay protocols. Adult and larval grass shrimp were more sensitive
   than the mysids to all the pyrethroids tested. Larval grass shrimp were
   approximately 18-fold more sensitive to lambda-cyhalothrin than the
   mysids. Larval grass shrimp were similar in sensitivity to adult grass
   shrimp for cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and phenothrin, but larvae were
   approximately twice as sensitive to lambda-cyhalothrin and permethrin as
   adult shrimp. Acute toxicity to estuarine crustaceans occurred at low
   nanogram per liter concentrations of some pyrethroids, illustrating the
   need for careful regulation of the use of pyrethroid compounds in the
   coastal zone. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {Performing weeds: Gardening, plant agencies and urban plant conservation},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {124-136},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Private domestic gardens have been the site of diverse inquiry in both
   the social and natural sciences. Intersected by these inquiries this
   paper focuses on how `weeds' are (re)constituted through gardening
   practices in domestic gardens in Christchurch, New Zealand. The paper
   arises out of an interdisciplinary ecological and social scientific
   study of the factors influencing the distribution and regeneration of 12
   bird-dispersed native woody species from Riccarton Bush, an urban forest
   remnant of significant ecological rarity, into surrounding residential
   properties. As part of this study we were especially interested in how
   people's everyday experiences and encounters in their gardens guide
   their gardening practices and what possibilities, if any, these create
   for self-introduced native seedlings to establish, and mature into
   adults. Drawing inspiration from literatures on human-plant relations we
   use the concepts of performance, non-human and `planty' agencies to
   argue that weeds are performed by people and plants rather than having a
   pre-determined or pre-figured meaning. Empirically the paper seeks to
   highlight the diverse, unique and disruptive agencies of plants.
   Methodologically it reflects on ways of engaging with and researching
   human-plant relations. In concluding, the paper examines how concepts of
   performance, non-human and planty agencies can provide insights for weed
   management and urban plant conservation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Changes in breeding wader assemblages, vegetation and land use within
   machair environments over three decades},
Journal = {BIRD STUDY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Pages = {287-300},
Abstract = {Capsule Changing agricultural activity and soil chemistry appear to be
   associated with some changes in breeding wader assemblages on the
   machair of the Outer Hebrides, Scotland, between the 1980s and 2000s.
   Aims To identify potential factors in addition to nest predation by
   Hedgehogs that could have driven changes in machair breeding wader
   assemblage of the Western Isles.
   Methods Surveys of breeding waders in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s and of
   vegetation in 1976 and 2009 were carried out on machair habitats on the
   west coast of Uist (four study sites). Generalized linear mixed models
   were used to identify associations between: (1) breeding wader densities
   in 2007-2010 and vegetation metrics (Ellenberg indicator values, axes
   determined by detrended correspondence analyses and structural measures)
   derived from the 2009 vegetation survey and (2) changes in breeding
   wader densities between 1983-1987 and 2007-2010 and changes in
   vegetation metrics derived from surveys in 1976 and 2009. Reported
   changes in agricultural use were assessed from interviews with local
   land managers to assess the likely influence of land-use changes on
   vegetation and breeding waders.
   Results Changes in population densities of breeding waders differed
   between species and sites over the three decades. Overall, Eurasian
   Oystercatcher and Common Redshank increased. Common Ringed Plover,
   Dunlin and possibly Common Snipe decreased and there were no significant
   changes for Northern Lapwing. Changes in vegetation indicated relatively
   small decreases in soil fertility of machair grassland cultivation,
   increased soil salinity and a decrease in overall vegetation cover.
   Higher breeding wader densities were associated with higher values of
   soil moisture, pH, fertility, salinity, vegetation height, vegetation
   density and extent of cultivation with inter-specific differences mostly
   associated with vegetation structure. Where soil fertility declined,
   Ringed Plover and Dunlin tended to decline while Oystercatcher
   increased. Temporal changes in Lapwing density were positively
   associated with changes in soil moisture. Ringed Plover density changes
   were positively associated with indicators of vegetation shade
   intolerance, soil acidity, soil fertility and reduced soil salinity.
   Changes of Redshank were positively associated with vegetation height.
   Reported changes in land use included a reduction in the number of
   people practising cultivation, though not necessarily in the area
   cultivated, reductions in numbers of grazing cattle and increases in
   numbers of sheep, a switch from using seaweed and farmyard manure to
   using compound fertilizers and deeper ploughing.
   Conclusions Although pointing to some interesting changes in machair
   systems associated with soil fertility, moisture and salinity that may
   have affected breeding waders, possibly acting through alterations to
   food supplies, further understanding of how waders use the mosaic of
   habitats is required to understand potential mechanisms. The importance
   of vegetation changes relative to, and interacting with, predation
   deserves further attention.},

Title = {Macrolepidoptera biodiversity in Wooster, Ohio from 2001 through 2009},
Journal = {ZOOKEYS},
Year = {2014},
Number = {452},
Pages = {79-105},
Abstract = {A Skinner mercury vapor light trap was operated from 2001 through 2009
   in a residential backyard to document biodiversity within the moth
   families Thyatiridae, Drepanidae, Geometridae, Mimallonidae,
   Apatelodidae, Lasiocampidae, Saturniidae, Sphingidae, Erebidae
   (including Lymantriinae and Arctiinae), Euteliidae, Nolidae, and
   Noctuidae. When making comparisons to older literature, we recalculated
   our results to conform to the older classification of the Noctuoidea.
   Moths were released after identification. There were 501 species
   documented in 77581 captures from 1290 sampling dates. There was a
   perceived risk that released moths would fly back into the trap the
   following evening. This should result in an abnormal number of rare
   moths that are caught multiple times. The number of species caught twice
   versus the number caught once was no different than a similar ratio for
   surveys that used more traditional sampling methods. Therefore this
   concern does not seem to be valid for these data. These data are
   provided in a supplementary file available for download.
   There were three previous surveys conducted in nearby natural areas.
   They documented fewer species than were documented here. To understand
   this better, we examined several specialized groups of moths that tend
   to use host plants not typically found in an urban residential yard.
   More species in Schinia Hubner, Catocala Schrank, Acronicta
   Ochsenheimer, and Herminiinae Leech were found in this survey than the
   other local surveys. Only in the Papaipema Smith did we recover fewer
   species, though it was still above 70\% of what was expected. This
   diversity could be a result of sampling effort, but it shows that this
   urban location has a very diverse moth fauna. We suggest that this
   diversity is partly due to the planting of native plant species in the
   area about the light trap. Therefore we would concur with others that
   urban landscapes can be planned to increase biodiversity relevant to
   more natural ecosystems.
   In this study we looked at the ratio of the number of species of
   Geometridae divided by the number of species of Noctuidae as one
   approach to evaluating the level of disturbance in the moth assemblage.
   Although the yearly average was nearly constant, the seasonal ratio
   ranged from 0.09 to 0.91 depending on the sampling date. We also
   calculated alpha diversity and found that seasonal change in alpha
   diversity greatly exceeded yearly differences. This strong seasonal
   component means that a comparison between two studies requires a
   correction for seasonality and similar sampling intervals. In this
   study, a shift of two weeks would be sufficient to result in a
   significant difference in alpha diversity. This is the equivalent of
   increasing temperature by 1.53 degrees C. Seasonal shifts limit the
   usefulness of this methodology for environmental assessment because the
   within season change exceeds the between season change. This problem is
   compounded when sampling designs interact with this seasonality.
   In describing our data, we made use of a growing degree day (GDD) model.
   This approach corrects for simple temperature dependent shifts in moth
   biology. Consequently, some of the variability in the data was removed,
   which should improve the power of statistical tests involving survey
   data. If sampling protocols were based on growing degree days rather
   than calendar dates, the bias caused by temperature induced shifts in
   seasonal cycles could be reduced.},

Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {806-813},
Abstract = {There is increasing evidence of a positive relation between green spaces
   in people's living environment and self-reported indicators of physical
   and mental health. However, to this moment health anxiety has not been
   contextualized in the light of the restorative and anxiolytic
   experiences of urban nature nor has it been studied in reference to the
   awareness of nature experiences. We aimed to determine whether
   ``awareness of nature experiences{''} was a significant modifier of the
   beneficial effects of interaction of older citizens with urban green
   spaces. This construct represents the purposeful and conscious
   interaction with nature, a specific behaviour pre-formed as a cognitive
   representation of the ``self' in a natural context, providing an
   internal replica of the previously experienced external natural world
   which guides people when they choose to visit an urban park. A
   cross-sectional interview study was conducted amongst 97 elderly
   visitors of ``Tzar Simeon Garden{''} Park in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. After
   controlling for ``awareness of nature experiences{''}, hierarchical
   multiple regression model accounted for 94\% of the variance in health
   anxiety. The independent variables ``appreciation of bird songs{''},
   ``appreciation of vegetation{''}, ``weekly visits to the park{''} and
   ``years of visiting the park{''} remained significant, but their power
   decreased, and ``age{''} became non-significant predictor. The overall
   predictive capacity of the model rose significantly after ``awareness of
   nature experiences{''} was added. In conclusion, health anxiety among
   Bulgarian elderly adults is somewhat higher than in other similar
   populations but still does not exceed acceptable levels. The actual
   interaction and experiences of the park were predictors of health
   anxiety independent from confounding factors. Their power, however, was
   to some extent dependent on individual ``awareness of nature
   experiences{''}, which had unique contribution to the model. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Using the point count method, linear mixed models, Shannon's diversity
   index, and Bray-Curtis cluster analysis, we conducted a study of the
   effect of urban fabric layout on bird diversity and distribution in
   northern Rwanda. The results showed a significant effect of city
   landscapes on bird richness and relative abundance; residential
   neighborhoods, institutional grounds, and informal settlements had the
   highest species diversity in comparison to other microlandscape types.
   Riversides were characterized by specialized bird species, commonly
   known to be restricted to wetland environments. Built-up areas and open
   field landscapes had comparable results. One Albertine Rift endemic bird
   species, the Ruwenzori Double-collared Sunbird (Cinnyris stuhlmanni),
   was recorded. Three migratory birds were found in Musanze city for the
   first time: the Common Sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos), the Spotted
   Flycatcher (Muscicapa striata), and the Willow Warbler (Phylloscopus
   trochilus). Two bird species have not been previously reported in
   Rwanda: the Garden Warbler (Sylvia borin) and the Lesser Spotted Eagle
   (Aquila pomarina). The implications of this study are particularly
   relevant to urban decision makers who should consider the existence of a
   great diversity of avian fauna when developing and implementing master

Title = {Native and exotic woody vegetation communities in domestic gardens in

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Vegetation in private gardens contributes significantly to plant species
   richness and vegetation volume across urban areas. Drivers of garden
   diversity and structure are complex, reflecting the diversity of social,
   cultural, and socioeconomic characteristics of the householders who
   manage their gardens, as well as their predecessors. Here we investigate
   the woodiness of gardens, and focus on (1) the prevalence of native
   versus exotic woody plants and (2) the influence of characteristics of
   garden owners, the gardens, and their proximity to neighborhood green
   spaces to identify the degree to which these factors explain patterns in
   native and exotic woody species communities in entire (back and front)
   gardens in southern temperate New Zealand. We found few consistent
   patterns in structure in woody species community composition. Outlying
   gardens were characterized by low species richness and abundance.
   Thirty-seven species commonly occurred across most gardens: most of
   these were exotic. Twelve native species were common throughout most
   gardens. There was significant but weak matching to social and
   environmental variables: vegetated area, species knowledge, and
   education explained pattern in native communities, whereas vegetated
   area, species knowledge, and householder age explained variation in
   exotic communities. Native trees >5 m tall occurred in only 58\% of
   gardens. Tall tree density was 10/ha, and 29\% of gardens lacked any
   trees >5 m. Tree presence was weakly (positively) associated with extent
   and proximity of neighborhood green space. We suggest that the legacy of
   previous owners' gardening practices is important to consider when
   identifying drivers of garden plant community structure.},

Abstract = {The fragmentation of landscapes, induced by the growing urbanisation, is
   a major cause of biodiversity loss. Ecological corridors are landscape
   elements that make up for the negative effects of habitat fragmentation
   in agricultural or natural landscapes. However, their effectiveness have
   been rarely assess in an urban context. To do so, we analysed shrews in
   woodlots, corridors and domestic gardens that are connected or
   disconnected from a corridor. Indeed, these mammals are very sensitive
   to fragmentation and could play an important ecological role even in
   small and isolated areas such as domestic gardens. Ninety-seven shrews,
   from three species were trapped. In our study, Sorex coronatus, Sorex
   minutus and Crocidura russula were not widely distributed and mainly
   occurred in woodlots, corridors and connected gardens. In gardens, shrew
   occurrences were mainly determined by landscape configuration with
   negative effects of the distance to the corridor and the distance to the
   woodlot, stronger for C.russula than Sorex species. At the local scale,
   garden management and vegetation showed a positive effect mainly for
   Sorex species. The quality of gardens seems good enough to permit the
   co-occurrence of several species of shrews and thus competition was not
   identified as a major process for determining the occurrence. We showed
   that, as in other ecosystems, ecological corridors in urban context can
   play an effective role for the distribution of organisms with low
   dispersal capabilities and should be develop in planning strategies.},

Abstract = {1 Tropical small-holder farmers rely on sustainable food production.
   Crop seed predation by ants can cause substantial yield loss and result
   in high pesticide use.
   2 We conducted field experiments and questionnaire-based surveys aiming
   to assess the effect of sown-seed predation on four crop species
   (Cucumis sativus, Daucus carota, Capsicum frutescens and Solanum
   melongena) in 15 vegetable gardens and the resulting impact on the net
   income of Indonesian farmers. Furthermore, we tested a commonly applied
   insecticide and herbicide for seed, seedling and plant protection aiming
   to understand their effect on ant seed predation.
   3 We found that the mean percentage of seeds removed per garden was
   42.0\%, 49.4\%, 48.0\% and 50.6\% for C. sativus, D. carota, C.
   frutescens and S. melongena, respectively, halving the farmers' income
   after considering initial and operational costs. Insecticide and
   herbicide treatments did not affect seed predation success or overall
   ant abundance, although they had positive and negative effects on ant
   species-specific abundance.
   4 High overall ant abundance caused high seed predation rate in all
   gardens as a result of a functional redundancy of ant species, which
   compensated for pesticide-related species loss.
   5 Environmentally-friendly and more sustainable practices such as
   overseeding or seedling production in nurseries could substitute for
   these inefficient approaches of chemical pest control, although this
   requires further research.},

Title = {New incursions of West Nile virus lineage 2 in Italy in 2013: the value

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is one of the most serious public health threats
   that Europe and the Mediterranean countries are currently facing. In
   Italy, WNV emerged in 1998 and has been circulating since 2008. To
   tackle its continuous incursions, Italian national and regional
   institutions set up a surveillance program, which includes the
   serological screening of sentinel horses, sentinel-chickens and backyard
   poultry flocks and the surveillance on all equine neurological cases,
   resident captured and wild dead birds, and vectors. This communication
   aims to assess the importance of the entomological surveillance program
   as an early warning system for WNV circulation. In the province of
   Modena, the circulation of WNV lineage 2 strains was first detected in
   pools of Culex pipiens on July the 3rd, 42 days prior to the onset of
   the first 2013 human WNV neuroinvasive case reported in the same
   province. Similarly in Veneto, WNV was first detected on July 3rd in a
   pool of Cx. pipiens collected in the province of Venezia. The first
   human neuroinvasive case in this region occurred in the Rovigo province
   on July the 24th, seven days after the detection of WNV lineage 2 in a
   mosquito pool collected in the same province. Up to the end of July
   2013, WNV circulation was further detected in several other pools of Cx.
   pipiens mosquitoes collected in Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Lombardia.
   According to the NS3 partial sequence alignments including all recent
   European and Italian Lineage 2 strains, the new circulating WNV lineage
   2 strains share high nt homology with the Hungarian and with the
   previous lineage 2 strains isolated in Veneto and Sardegna in 2011 and
   2012. These data provide a clear and practical demonstration of the
   relevance of a reliable entomological surveillance program to early
   detect WNV in Italy.},

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Two synchronous projects undertaken in 2011 examined the likely impact
   of increasing urban densification on invertebrate populations within
   urban settlement in Perth, Western Australia. One project analysed the
   ant fauna found in 20 gardens and lawns in small to very small
   properties (these having a bungalow or duplex (semi-detached) as the
   main residential building, and a lawn or garden area of 43 m(2)-332
   m(2)) east, south, north and west of the Central Business District
   (CBD). The other project examined the ant fauna at 14 sites, principally
   in native regrowth along the Kwinana Freeway, a major artery that runs
   north to south through Perth's suburbs. The gardens and lawns produced a
   very depauperate fauna of 26 ant species, of which a maximum of 20 were
   native and at least six species were exotic. The ant fauna from regrowth
   adjacent to the Kwinana Freeway and at two additional sites (one a bush
   control) was more than twice as rich, the 56 species collected including
   only two exotics. In the garden project, ant richness, evenness and
   abundance were not significantly correlated with size of the garden
   area. The same applied even when the exotic Pheidole
   megacephala-dominated gardens were removed from the analysis. Ordination
   analysis combining the two sets of data revealed a distinct clustering
   of most of the regrowth sites, whereas the bush control stood alone and
   garden or lawn sites exhibited a much looser pattern of association. We
   suggest that increasing the density of Perth suburbs is resulting in
   drastic loss of native invertebrate fauna, of which ants are a useful
   bioindicator. However, native vegetation regrowth along major arterial
   roads could act as a reservoir for invertebrate species that might
   otherwise disappear entirely from the Perth metropolitan area.},

Title = {Predicting Summer Site Occupancy for an Invasive Species, the Common
   Brushtail Possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), in an Urban Environment},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Invasive species are often favoured in fragmented, highly-modified,
   human-dominated landscapes such as urban areas. Because successful
   invasive urban adapters can occupy habitat that is quite different from
   that in their original range, effective management programmes for
   invasive species in urban areas require an understanding of
   distribution, habitat and resource requirements at a local scale that is
   tailored to the fine-scale heterogeneity typical of urban landscapes.
   The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is one of New
   Zealand's most destructive invasive pest species. As brushtail possums
   traditionally occupy forest habitat, control in New Zealand has focussed
   on rural and forest habitats, and forest fragments in cities. However,
   as successful urban adapters, possums may be occupying a wider range of
   habitats. Here we use site occupancy methods to determine the
   distribution of brushtail possums across five distinguishable urban
   habitat types during summer, which is when possums have the greatest
   impacts on breeding birds. We collected data on possum presence/absence
   and habitat characteristics, including possible sources of supplementary
   food (fruit trees, vegetable gardens, compost heaps), and the
   availability of forest fragments from 150 survey locations. Predictive
   distribution models constructed using the programme PRESENCE revealed
   that while occupancy rates were highest in forest fragments, possums
   were still present across a large proportion of residential habitat with
   occupancy decreasing as housing density increased and green cover
   decreased. The presence of supplementary food sources was important in
   predicting possum occupancy, which may reflect the high nutritional
   value of these food types. Additionally, occupancy decreased as the
   proportion of forest fragment decreased, indicating the importance of
   forest fragments in determining possum distribution. Control operations
   to protect native birds from possum predation in cities should include
   well-vegetated residential areas; these modified habitats not only
   support possums but provide a source for reinvasion of fragments.},

Abstract = {The emergence and spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 has
   caused substantial poultry-related economic losses and public health
   concerns in relation to a potential pandemic. While biosecurity measures
   for commercial poultry industry are of the highest standards, these
   measures are difficult to implement and often unaffordable for backyard
   poultry farming, particularly in tropical and low-income settings. We
   designed a feasible biosecurity intervention to improve flock hygiene in
   Cambodia, - based on community hygiene, cleaning of poultry flock areas
   and human and poultry movement control. We conducted a cluster
   randomized and controlled intervention trial in 18 villages in Takeo
   province to evaluate improvements in biosecurity-related knowledge and
   practices. The intervention relied on community involvement and
   community education using special information dissemination tools. We
   trained village teams (VT) to assist villagers in implementing the
   intervention using a cascade training approach, in which a few
   individuals were trained, who in turn trained a larger group of people.
   During the 14 month follow up, we conducted observational and
   interview-based surveys (baseline vs. final surveys, VT supervision
   visits, monitoring surveys) to assess VTs' motivation, intervention
   messages dissemination and the implementation of recommended measures.
   Most of villagers (95\%, confidence interval: 87.8-100.0\%) in
   intervention villages received general information about how to raise
   poultry. Farmers in intervention villages reported to have made more
   changes (>= 1 biosecurity related practice during the study period)
   compared with that of control villages (70.0\% (260/372) vs. 22.6\%
   (85/377), p value < 0.01). When observing biosecurity-related practices
   in intervention villages, overall scores increased significantly (p <
   0.05). Practices such as use of quarantine cages for new and sick birds,
   limitation of people movement in backyards and waste management reached
   high scores during the 15-months period within five of the nine
   intervention villages. Cascade training managed to reach out to almost
   all villagers and significantly influence changes in biosecurity
   practices in the community. However, further follow-ups are needed to
   assess whether practices-related changes persist over a longer period of
   time. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {How should we grow cities to minimize their biodiversity impacts?},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {401-410},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Urbanization causes severe environmental degradation and continues to
   increase in scale and intensity around the world, but little is known
   about how we should design cities to minimize their ecological impact.
   With a sprawling style of urban development, low intensity impact is
   spread across a wide area, and with a compact form of development
   intense impact is concentrated over a small area; it remains unclear
   which of these development styles has a lower overall ecological impact.
   Here, we compare the consequences of compact and sprawling urban growth
   patterns on bird distributions across the city of Brisbane, Australia.
   We predicted the impact on bird populations of adding 84 642 houses to
   the city in either a compact or sprawling design using statistical
   models of bird distributions. We show that urban growth of any type
   reduces bird distributions overall, but compact development
   substantially slows these reductions at the city scale. Urban-sensitive
   species particularly benefited from compact development at the city
   scale because large green spaces were left intact, whereas the
   distributions of nonnative species expanded as a result of sprawling
   development. As well as minimizing ecological disruption, compact urban
   development maintains human access to public green spaces. However,
   backyards are smaller, which impacts opportunities for people to
   experience nature close to home. Our results suggest that cities built
   to minimize per capita ecological impact are characterized by high
   residential density, with large interstitial green spaces and small
   backyards, and that there are important trade-offs between maintaining
   city-wide species diversity and people's access to biodiversity in their
   own backyard.},

Abstract = {1. Sedentary grazers can be numerous in fresh waters, despite the
   constraints on resource availability and the increased predation risk
   inherent in this lifestyle. The retreats of sedentary grazers have been
   assumed to provide protection to the resident (a house), but also may
   provide additional fertilised food for the grazer (i.e. a garden). If
   retreats function as a garden, then they should (i) contain a higher
   quality and/or quantity of food than the alternative food source.
   Furthermore, the proportion of retreat-derived carbon and nitrogen
   assimilated by the resident should be (ii) related to overall resource
   availability (more when resources are limited) or (iii) perhaps also to
   larval density. Alternatively, if retreats provide a less risky food
   source, then (iv) assimilation of material from the retreat is likely to
   be greater under conditions in which the risk of emerging from the
   retreat is high. 2. We tested these four hypotheses for the common and
   widespread gallery-building grazing caddisfly Tinodes waeneri. Resource
   availability, larval density and biomass, and exposure were measured for
   populations from six lakes of differing productivity in August, October
   and January. 3. Galleries always contained more algal food than the
   surrounding epilithon, suggesting that gardening is effective.
   Furthermore, gallery chlorophyll a content in August, and the disparity
   in food quality (assessed from the C : N ratio) between gallery and
   epilithon (quality higher in the former) in October were positively
   related to the proportion of larval biomass that was derived from the
   gallery. Larval density and wave exposure parameters were not related to
   larval assimilation of gallery material. 4. Galleries that are
   fertilised by the occupant provide more, and sometimes also better
   quality, food (in terms of the C : N ratio) than is otherwise available.
   Thus, the gallery plays a substantial role in larval nutrition, and this
   role is greater at key times of food shortage.},

Abstract = {We evaluated the strategies to tackle maternal and infant health
   problems developed by women's groups in rural Malawi.
   Quantitative data were analyzed on strategies developed by 184 groups at
   two of the meetings in the community action cycle (attended by 3365 and
   3047 women). Data on strategies implemented was collected through a
   survey of the 197 groups active in January 2010. Qualitative data on the
   identification and implementation of strategies was collected through 17
   focus group discussions and 12 interviews with men and women.
   To address the maternal and child health problems identified the five
   most common strategies identified were: health education sessions,
   bicycle ambulances, training of traditional birth attendants, wetland
   vegetable garden (dimba garden) cultivation and distribution of
   insecticide treated bednets (ITNs). The five most common strategies
   actually implemented were: dimba garden cultivation, health education
   sessions, ITN distribution, health programme radio listening clubs and
   clearing house surroundings. The rationale behind the strategies and the
   factors facilitating and hindering implementation are presented.
   The potential impact of the strategies on health is discussed. Women's
   groups help communities to take control of their health issues and have
   the potential to reduce neonatal, infant and maternal mortality and
   morbidity in the longer term. (C) 2012 Royal Society of Tropical

Title = {Linking Foraging Decisions to Residential Yard Bird Composition},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Urban bird communities have higher densities but lower diversity
   compared with wildlands. However, recent studies show that residential
   urban yards with native plantings have higher native bird diversity
   compared with yards with exotic vegetation. Here we tested whether
   landscape designs also affect bird foraging behavior. We estimated
   foraging decisions by measuring the giving-up densities (GUD; amount of
   food resources remaining when the final forager quits foraging on an
   artificial food patch, i.e seed trays) in residential yards in Phoenix,
   AZ, USA. We assessed how two yard designs (mesic: lush, exotic
   vegetation; xeric: drought-tolerant and native vegetation) differed in
   foraging costs. Further, we developed a statistical model to calculate
   GUDs for every species visiting the seed tray. Birds foraging in mesic
   yards depleted seed trays to a lower level (i.e. had lower GUDs)
   compared to birds foraging in xeric yards. After accounting for bird
   densities, the lower GUDs in mesic yards appeared largely driven by
   invasive and synanthropic species. Furthermore, behavioral responses of
   individual species were affected by yard design. Species visiting trays
   in both yard designs had lower GUDs in mesic yards. Differences in
   resource abundance (i.e., alternative resources more abundant and of
   higher quality in xeric yards) contributed to our results, while
   predation costs associated with foraging did not. By enhancing the GUD,
   a common method for assessing the costs associated with foraging, our
   statistical model provided insights into how individual species and bird
   densities influenced the GUD. These differences we found in foraging
   behavior were indicative of differences in habitat quality, and thus our
   study lends additional support for native landscapes to help reverse the
   loss of urban bird diversity.},

   (Cactaceae) in the Tehuacan Valley: human guided selection and gene flow},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 14},
Abstract = {Background: Use of plant resources and ecosystems practiced by
   indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica commonly involves domestication of
   plant populations and landscapes. Our study analyzed interactions of
   coexisting wild and managed populations of the pitaya Stenocereus
   pruinosus, a columnar cactus used for its edible fruit occurring in
   natural forests, silviculturally managed in milpa agroforestry systems,
   and agriculturally managed in homegardens of the Tehuacan Valley,
   Mexico. We aimed at analyzing criteria of artificial selection and their
   consequences on phenotypic diversity and differentiation, as well as
   documenting management of propagules at landscape level and their
   possible contribution to gene flow among populations.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted to 83 households of
   the region to document perception of variation, criteria of artificial
   selection, and patterns of moving propagules among wild and managed
   populations. Morphological variation of trees from nine wild,
   silviculturally and agriculturally managed populations was analyzed for
   37 characters through univariate and multivariate statistical methods.
   In addition, indexes of morphological diversity (MD) per population and
   phenotypic differentiation (PD) among populations were calculated using
   character states and frequencies.
   Results: People recognized 15 pitaya varieties based on their pulp
   color, fruit size, form, flavor, and thorniness. On average, in wild
   populations we recorded one variety per population, in silviculturally
   managed populations 1.58 +/- 0.77 varieties per parcel, and in
   agriculturally managed populations 2.19 +/- 1.12 varieties per
   homegarden. Farmers select in favor of sweet flavor (71\% of households
   interviewed) and pulp color (46\%) mainly red, orange and yellow.
   Artificial selection is practiced in homegardens and 65\% of people
   interviewed also do it in agroforestry systems. People obtain fruit and
   branches from different population types and move propagules from one
   another. Multivariate analyses showed morphological differentiation of
   wild and agriculturally managed populations, mainly due to differences
   in reproductive characters; however, the phenotypic differentiation
   indexes were relatively low among all populations studied. Morphological
   diversity of S. pruinosus (average MD = 0.600) is higher than in other
   columnar cacti species previously analyzed.
   Conclusions: Artificial selection in favor of high quality fruit
   promotes morphological variation and divergence because of the continual
   replacement of plant material propagated and introduction of propagules
   from other villages and regions. This process is counteracted by high
   gene flow influenced by natural factors (pollinators and seed
   dispersers) but also by human management (movement of propagules among
   populations), all of which determines relatively low phenotypic
   differentiation among populations. Conservation of genetic resources of
   S. pruinosus should be based on the traditional forms of germplasm
   management by local people.},

Abstract = {Cat predation of birds in residential landscapes is ephemeral,
   unpredictable, and spatially dispersed, and thus requires many
   person-hours to observe. We sought to identify whether specific
   behaviors, traits, or feeding ecologies of birds contribute to their
   probability of cat-caused mortality around residences across temperate
   North America. In addressing this question, we evaluated citizen science
   data with respect to peer-reviewed species accounts (Birds of North
   America, BNA). Using information on cat predation from the BNA, we found
   that species that glean their prey from the ground or breed in nest
   boxes were three times more likely to be depredated by cats, while birds
   that hawk were over two times less likely to become cat prey than would
   be predicted by random chance. Data from citizen science sources also
   showed that birds using nest boxes had increased susceptibility to cat
   predation, as did those that use feeders and that glean from foliage. We
   caution that observations of predation by citizen science volunteers may
   be biased towards detection at feeders. Future research should focus on
   developing volunteer survey techniques for improving estimates of bird
   mortality rates and sources.},

Abstract = {Urban processes lead to species loss. Palmas is a young city under
   construction; thus, it provides a rare opportunity to analyze changes in
   bird richness in a developing city. Eighty city blocks, which were
   classified into five different categories according to different levels
   of urbanization, were sampled. Bird counting took place during a dry
   season and a rainy season in four parallel transects in each block. In
   these blocks, we estimated 20 variables related to woody vegetation,
   land cover and type of urban use. The estimated bird species richness
   for the study area was very high (151 species); nevertheless, species
   reduction occurred as a function of the urbanization processes. Although
   representing only 11\% of the city surface, the not-urbanized blocks
   showed the highest species richness, which corresponded to 96.3\% of the
   richness estimated in the city. The average species richness for most
   trophic groups, families, open-field or forest species and resident or
   migratory species decreased significantly in urbanized blocks. According
   to a Hierarchical Partitioning analysis the environmental variables that
   made the greatest positive contribution to the variation in bird species
   richness in urbanized blocks were the percentage of block area planned
   for residential use, the density of native trees and the percentage area
   covered by unpaved roads, whereas the commercial block density, the
   density of exotic trees and the percentage of block area built had the
   greatest negative contribution. Based on our results, policies aimed to
   maintain Cerrado native species in urbanized blocks would contribute to
   reduce bird species loss. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Number = {7},
Pages = {583-592},
Abstract = {Context. Increasingly, ornithologists are being asked to identify major
   sources of avian mortality so as to identify conservation priorities.
   Aims. Considerable evidence suggests that windows of office towers are a
   lethal hazard for migrating birds. The factors influencing the risk of
   bird-window collisions in residential settings are not understood as
   well.
   Methods. Citizen scientists were requested to participate in an online
   survey that asked about characteristics concerning their homes and
   yards, general demographic information about participants, and whether
   they had observed evidence of bird-window collisions at their home.
   Key results. We found that 39.0\% of 1458 participants observed a
   bird-window collision in the previous year. The mean number of reported
   collisions was 1.7 +/- 4.6 per residence per year, with 38\% of
   collisions resulting in a mortality.
   Conclusions. Collisions were not random, with the highest collision and
   mortality rates at rural residences, with bird feeders > rural
   residences without feeders > urban residences with feeders > urban
   residences without feeders > apartments. At urban houses, the age of
   neighbourhood was a significant predictor of collision rates, with newer
   neighbourhoods reporting fewer collisions than older neighbourhoods.
   Most people remembered collisions occurring in the summer months.
   Implications. Our results are consistent with past research, suggesting
   that window collisions with residential homes are an important source of
   mortality for birds. However, we found large variation in the frequency
   of collisions at different types of residences. Proper stratification of
   residence type is crucial to getting accurate estimates of bird-window
   collisions when scaling local data into larger-scale mortality
   estimates.},

Title = {Population dynamics of Dasycercus blythi (Marsupialia:
   Dasyuridae) in central Australia: how does the mulgara persist?},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Number = {5},
Pages = {419-428},
Abstract = {Context. Central Australia has been a graveyard for native mammals, with
   many small and medium-sized species becoming extinct or persisting in
   reduced geographical ranges in this region since the advent of European
   settlement. Species in the critical weight range (35-5500 g) have been
   affected most dramatically.
   Aims. We compared the dynamics of two geographically distant populations
   of a medium-sized surviving desert mammal, the brush-tailed mulgara
   (Dasycercus blythi, similar to 100 g), and tested the hypothesis that
   this species' persistence can be explained by its demographic
   plasticity.
   Methods. Paired sampling grids, each 31.5 ha, were set up in the Tanami
   Desert on the northern edge of the species' geographical range and near
   Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park (UKTNP) on the southern boundary. Animals
   were live-trapped every 3 months between 1992 and 1995, and estimates
   made of population size, residency, reproduction, bodyweight and tail
   width; the latter was used as an index of condition.
   Key results. The UKTNP site supported a larger population of D. blythi
   than did the Tanami Desert site. In both areas, the population
   fluctuated annually, declining during the breeding season (June to
   October) and increasing again following the influx of juveniles in
   spring. Females had one litter per year, with a median and maximum
   litter size of six; births in the Tanami occurred in July, at least a
   month earlier than they did at UKTNP. Bodyweights and tail widths peaked
   before breeding and then declined until spring, with animals retaining
   better body condition in the Tanami than at UKTNP. In both regions,
   individuals were resident for 1-2 years; daughters remained near their
   mother's home range but males moved to other areas.
   Conclusions. The results provided little support for our initial
   expectation that populations of D. blythi would behave differently in
   disparate parts of the species' geographical range, and suggested
   instead that this mulgara exhibits a predictable life history, with
   limited demographic flexibility.
   Implications. The persistence of D. blythi in central Australia is most
   likely a result of its striking flexibility in use of food resources,
   its ability to enter torpor and to tolerate large declines in bodyweight
   and condition, and its propensity to dig deep burrows. We suggest that
   these attributes buffer mulgaras from the impacts of introduced
   predators that have contributed to extinctions of other medium-sized
   marsupials, and from climatic and resource uncertainties that shape the
   dynamics of many smaller desert mammals.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {154},

Abstract = {A detailed knowledge of the habitat requirements of steppe birds living
   in farmland habitats is necessary to identify agricultural practices
   compatible with their conservation. The globally threatened Great
   Bustard Otis tarda is a partial migrant in central Iberia, but factors
   affecting its winter habitat use have not been identified. We assessed
   habitat differences between breeding and wintering areas and winter
   habitat selection of radiotagged migrant female Great Bustards in
   central Spain. Of 68 tagged females, 35\% moved to wintering areas
   located 64.3 +/- 24.0 km south of their breeding areas, and 80\%
   wintered in a single area of c. 236 km2. A census of the population in
   this area identified it as one of the most important wintering areas of
   this species in the world, holding c. 1500 individuals. There were
   significant differences between breeding and wintering habitats of
   individually marked migrant females. Compared with breeding areas,
   wintering areas of migrant females were located further from roads and
   urban nuclei, had lower human population densities and area of urban
   developments, and a higher diversity of land-use types, with less cover
   of cereals and more vineyards and olive groves. Within this area,
   radiotracked migrant females preferred sites with more vineyards and a
   lower land-use diversity. Our results highlight the importance of
   traditional Mediterranean dry farmland mosaics, and suggest that
   different conservation strategies are needed for migrant and resident
   populations in winter to secure the conservation of suitable wintering
   habitat for Great Bustards in the Iberian Peninsula.},

Title = {Accounting for detectability when estimating avian abundance in an urban
   area},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {391-397},
Abstract = {Urban areas can support significant bird populations, including species
   of conservation concern, but urban ecologists have been slow to apply
   detectability-based counting techniques. We compared abundances and
   relative abundances of eight urban birds, derived using two commonly
   applied techniques (fixed-radius point and strip sampling) and distance
   sampling. We evaluated the influence of habitat and two covariates
   (observer and whether birds were seen or heard) on detectability. Due to
   built-up structures in urban areas, point counts are appropriate.
   Unavoidable and sometimes complex but necessary interactions with
   multiple property owners may compromise the number of points able to be
   counted and therefore the precision of estimates. Abundances from strip
   and fixed-radius point counts were on average only one-third (strip) and
   less than one-half (fixed-radius point) those obtained using distance
   sampling, with interspecific variation in the degree to which densities
   were underestimated. Rankings of relative abundances were mostly
   similar, although distance sampling ranked silvereye (Zosterops
   lateralis) and grey warbler (Geggone igata) relatively higher in
   residential habitat. Habitat did not appear to influence detectability
   for most species, but the two covariates (observer and seen/heard)
   improved model fit for a number of species, indicating it is useful to
   record this information. Well-standardised non-detectability-based
   counts could provide useful information on community structure and
   relative abundances in urban areas, but distance sampling is necessary
   to track the population status of species, although it cannot usefully
   be applied to rare species.},

Volume = {34},
Number = {5},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urbanisation affects indigenous fauna in many ways; some species persist
   and even increase in urban areas, whereas others are lost. The causative
   mechanisms determining changes in distributions and community structure
   remain elusive. We investigated three hypothesized mechanisms, which
   influence success or failure of the insectivorous bat assemblage across
   the urban landscape of Sydney, Australia; landscape heterogeneity
   (diversity of land uses), productivity (as indexed by landscape geology)
   and trait diversity. We present data on species richness and activity
   (bat passes per night) collected systematically using ultrasonic bat
   detectors from randomly selected landscapes (each 25 km2). Landscapes
   were categorized into classes including urban, suburban and vegetated,
   where suburban sites were additionally stratified based on geology, as a
   proxy for productivity. Four landscape elements were sampled within each
   landscape, including remnant bushland (>2 ha), riparian areas, open
   space/parkland and residential/built space. We found that there was
   significantly greater bat activity and more species of bat in areas on
   fertile shale geologies (p<0.05), supporting the productivity, rather
   than the heterogeneity hypothesis. Within landscapes, there was no
   significant effect of the landscape element sampled, although bushland
   and riparian sites recorded greater bat activity than open space or
   backyard sites. Using general linear mixed models we found bat activity
   and species richness were sensitive to landscape geology and increasing
   housing density at a landscape scale. Using an RLQ analysis a
   significant relationship was found between these variables and species
   traits in structuring the community present (p<0.01). Specifically,
   open-adapted bats were associated with areas of greater housing density,
   while clutter-adapted bats were uncommon in urban areas and more
   associated with greater amounts of bushland in the landscape. Overall we
   found greater support for the productivity and traits hypotheses, rather
   than the heterogeneity hypothesis. The degree of urbanisation and amount
   of bushland remaining, in combination with landscape geology, influenced
   bat activity and mediated the trait response. Our findings reflect
   global trends of species diversity and abundance in urban landscapes,
   suggesting that processes affecting bat species distribution in urban
   ecosystems may be predictable at a landscape scale.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have revealed several examples of intimate associations

   Here, we surveyed Streptomyces Actinobacteria co-occurring with 10

   both phylogenetic and community ecology approaches. From these 10
   species, and 19 other scolytine beetles that occur in the same trees, we

Abstract = {The analysis of the fisheries in Passo de Torres was based on interviews
   and landings carried out between October 2007 and December 2009. The
   city has a fuel supply station, an ice factory, seven landing piers and
   three small shipyards. The fleet comprises 35 vessels (8-20 m, 40-360
   HP) that fish between Santa Marta and Rio Grande (28 degrees S-32
   degrees S) and provide fish to local market and processing industries in
   Santa Catarina state. This fleet fish mainly with driftnets, but also
   with trawls and bottom longline. The main species in the catches were
   Micropogonias furnieri, Cynoscion guatucupa, Urophycis brasiliensis,
   Pomatomus saltatrix, Sphyrna sp., Isurus oxyrinchus, Prionace glauca,
   Paralonchurus brasiliensis, Pleoticus muelleri, Artemesia longinaris and
   Epinephelus marginatus. Incidental catches of sea turtles, seabirds and
   marine mammals were reported; as a result, mitigation mechanisms must be
   found. Work relations among ship owners, masters and deck fishermen were
   based on verbal agreements that fix share in total income distribution.
   Most fishermen were born in the city and had low schooling and training.
   Fishing involved 6\% of the workforce and yielded about R\$ 8,039,000 in
   2008, second only to farming. The landings were estimated in 3,512
   tonnes, 2.5\% of the total in Santa Catarina state. In a scenario of
   decreasing resources, Passo de Torres could have some competitive
   advantages not only because it is closer to markets than Rio Grande and
   to fishing grounds than Laguna and Itajai.},

Abstract = {The substantial decline of eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) stocks
   along the east coast of the United States has prompted the growth of
   many types of restoration and enhancement efforts. One of the most
   recent types is oyster gardening. Oysters grown in floating structures
   are subsequently planted in bays, where they continue to live, grow, and
   spawn; filter the water; contribute to the larval pool; and provide
   habitat. Our study is one of the first evaluations of habitat value
   provided by floating oyster gardens in a degraded mid-Atlantic estuary.
   Oyster growth and survival within the floats was monitored in a
   eutrophic, turbid, periodically hypoxic, soft-bottom coastal lagoon
   system. We examined the abundance and diversity of fishes and
   invertebrates with respect to 3 replicated treatments: live oyster
   clusters, disarticulated oyster shell, and a float with no shells or
   oysters. We also studied the effects of 2 cleaning frequencies (biweekly
   and monthly) on species assemblages, and the growth and survival of
   oysters, and monitored basic water quality parameters. The species
   assemblages in floats with oyster clusters were very similar to those
   with loose shell but considerably different than that of empty floats.
   Cleaning frequency (biweekly and monthly) did not affect the growth or
   survival of oysters. Location of floats within the canal system,
   however, was a large determinant of oyster vital rates as well as
   community structure. Forty-nine species of fishes and invertebrates, and
   8 species of macroalgae were collected from floating oyster gardens,
   including 9 commercial or recreational fishery species, many of which
   are likely habitat limited in the Inland Bays because of the loss of
   tidal wetlands, oyster reefs, and seagrass beds. Newly settled juvenile
   oysters have been found for the first time within the floating oyster
   gear in the manmade, residential canal systems. Our results will be used
   to gauge the success of enhancement efforts and to improve our
   understanding of the effects oyster gardens on the Inland Bays

Abstract = {Turdus smithi, formerly a subspecies of T. olivaceus, has been elevated
   to species status, resulting in a void in our knowledge on this species.
   Although both T. smithi and T. olivaceus are common garden birds
   throughout their ranges, most studies to date have focused on T.
   olivaceus. These studies found that T. o. olivaceus reach ages in excess
   of 11 years and maintain territories of 10 000-13 000 m2. The present
   study investigated site fidelity and longevity of an urban T. smithi
   population at the University of Pretoria main campus in Gauteng.
   Thrushes were ringed with unique colour ring combinations and identified
   by resighting them later. We found that T. smithi individuals have high
   site fidelity, with some thrushes being present in their same home
   ranges nearly nine years after being ringed, and suspect that they
   occupied these territories continuously between ringing and resighting.
   We found that T. smithi maintain larger home ranges than T. olivaceus
   individuals, and have a similar maximum longevity. We propose that adult
   thrushes are able to persist in a given home range because they are able
   to avoid resident predators, e.g. feral cats Felis sylvestris catus, by
   accurately predicting their hunting strategies.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Many ecosystem services are in decline. Local ecological knowledge and
   associated practice are essential to sustain and enhance ecosystem
   services on the ground. Here, we focus on social or collective memory in
   relation to management practice that sustains ecosystem services, and
   investigate where and how ecological practices, knowledge and experience
   are retained and transmitted. We analyze such social-ecological memory
   of allotment gardens in the Stockholm urban area, Sweden. Allotment
   gardens support ecosystem services such as pollination, seed dispersal
   and pest regulation in the broader urban landscape. Surveys and
   interviews were preformed over a four-year period with several hundreds
   of gardeners. We found that the allotment gardens function as
   communities-of-practice, where participation and reification interact
   and social-ecological memory is a shared source of resilience of the
   community by being both emergent and persistent. Ecological practices
   and knowledge in allotment gardens are retained and transmitted by
   imitation of practices, oral communication and collective rituals and
   habits, as well as by the physical gardens, artifacts, metaphors and
   rules-in-use (institutions). Finally, a wider social context provides
   external support through various forms of media, markets, social
   networks, collaborative organizations, and legal structures. We
   exemplify the role of urban gardens in generating ecosystem services in
   times of crisis and change and conclude that stewards of urban green
   areas and the social memory that they carry may help counteract further
   decline of critical ecosystem services. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {19},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1385-1400},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Urbanization has destroyed and fragmented previously large areas of
   habitat. Small remnants that still exist in numerous cities will be
   unable to sustain many viable wild plant populations if they do not
   expand into the surrounding urban matrix. Residential gardens form a
   significant component of urban green space in many cities and therefore
   could play a role in redressing this problem. Our ecological and social
   scientific study examined factors influencing the dispersal and
   regeneration of 12 bird-dispersed native woody species from Riccarton
   Bush, a 7.8 ha urban forest remnant, into surrounding residential
   properties in Christchurch, New Zealand. Over 125 years, the reported
   number of native vascular plant species in the Bush has declined by a
   third. Some species, particularly Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, the dominant
   woody species in the Bush, are being dispersed by birds and establishing
   in residential gardens predominantly within 250 m of the forest margin.
   These juveniles are not reaching maturity as most gardeners tend to
   remove all non-planted woody species. This suggests natural potential
   for regeneration exists but is insufficient without active human
   intervention. Our survey results show people are supportive of native
   plants in general but lack knowledge of the species. They are willing to
   plant locally appropriate woody species if provided with plants,
   information, and, most importantly, control over the location of
   plantings. Residential gardens consequently have the potential to play a
   major role in the conservation of urban biodiversity especially for
   species suited to the functions and size of gardens.},

Journal = {HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {21-35},
Abstract = {From the 16th century onwards, English, Bretons, Basques, and Portuguese
   exploited the rich cod stocks of Newfoundland's Grand Banks. Several
   permanent settlements in eastern Newfoundland were begun in the early
   17th century, including the settlement at Ferry land (1621-1696).
   Planter families at Ferry land fished and welcomed seasonal fishing
   fleets, participating in a trade network that included the West Indies,
   New England, the Iberian Peninsula, the Mediterranean, and Great
   Britain. The colonization process brought about changes to the local
   environment due to both the intentional and unintentional importation of
   European plants and animals. The presence of a substantial percentage of
   nonnative plants and insects suggests that ballast dumping as well as
   the establishment of small cottage gardens contributed to the
   introduction of several species to Newfoundland. Data from
   archaeobotanical, archaeoentomological, and faunal analyses can be used
   to examine processes of biological transfer, landscape change, and
   development of local household economies of Ferry land residents.},

Number = {2},
Pages = {183-196},
Abstract = {Capsule Different urban breeding bird communities are associated with
   different habitat types, but, although community species diversity
   varies significantly, total bird density does not.
   Aims To investigate the association between breeding bird communities
   and habitats within Bristol, UK and how these communities vary in terms
   of species diversity and total bird abundance.
   Methods Breeding density data for 70 species in the metropolitan area of
   Bristol, UK were subjected to de-trended correspondence analysis to
   identify the number of different communities present and their indicator
   species. These data were then used to identify patterns of habitat
   association with each community and differences in species richness and
   total bird density.
   Results Three communities were identified: a rural community associated
   with woodland, managed grassland and inland water; a suburban community
   associated with buildings and residential gardens; and an intermediate
   community that shared some of these habitat characteristics. Species
   richness, but not total bird abundance, was lowest in the suburban
   community.
   Conclusion The diversity of species in urban areas appears to be most
   dependent upon the availability of patches of natural and semi-natural
   habitats. Residential gardens support fewer species, but those species
   that are present may be found at high densities.},

Abstract = {In some birds, yearling males (subadults) are less brightly coloured
   than the adult ones. To explain this phenomenon known as delayed plumage
   maturation (DPM), several hypotheses have recently been proposed. The
   aim of this paper was to test predictions of status signal hypothesis
   (SSH). This hypothesis claims that the adults less frequently attack
   dull coloured subadult males, and consequently DPM facilitates survival
   of subadults during the first breeding season. The experiments were
   performed in two habitats in the Prague suburbs: a housing estate and
   garden city. Subadult and adult males of the black redstart (Phoenicurus
   ochruros) were exposed to stuffed dummies of both age categories.
   Contrary to predictions of SSH, brown (subadult like) coloration of the
   dummy had no suppressive effect on defensive behaviour of the resident
   males. On the other hand, subadult males were more active in vocal
   territorial defence such as singing and producing snarl and whistle
   sounds during the experiments. The defenders of smaller territories
   generally behaved more aggressively than defenders of large territories
   in habitat of garden city, and especially adult males responded more
   aggressively against dummies in this habitat. In a housing estate, a
   habitat of evenly distributed resources (i.e. vertical surfaces), the
   birds tended to observe the dummy prior to attack it directly.},

Abstract = {We report on the first field evaluation of the public acceptability and
   performance of two types of lethal ovitrap (LO) in three separate trials
   in Cairns, Australia. Health workers were able to set standard lethal
   ovitraps (SLOs) in 75 and 71\% of premise yards in the wet and dry
   season, respectively, and biodegradable lethal ovitraps (BLOs) in 93\%
   of yards. Public acceptance, measured as retention of traps by
   residents, was high for both trap types, with < 9\% of traps missing
   after 4 weeks. Traps retaining water after 4 weeks were 78 and 34\% for
   the two SLO trials and 58\% for the BLOs. The `failure rate' in the 535
   BLOs set in the field for 4 weeks was 47\%, of which 19\% were lost,
   51\% had holes from probable insect chewing, 23\% were knocked over, 7\%
   had dried by evaporation and 1\% were split. There was no significant
   difference in the failure rate of BLOs set on porous (grass, soil and
   mulch) versus solid (tiles, concrete, wood and stone) substrates. The
   SLOs and the BLOs were readily acceptable to ovipositing Aedes aegypti
   L. (Diptera: Culicidae); the mean number of eggs/trap was 6 and 15, for
   the dry season and wet season SLO trial, respectively, and 15 for the
   BLO wet season trial. Indeed, 84-94\% of premise yards had egg positive
   SLOs or BLOs. A high percentage of both wet and dry season SLOs (29 and
   70\%, respectively) and BLOs (62\%) that were dry after 4 weeks were egg
   positive, indicating the traps had functioned. Lethal strips from SLOs
   and BLOs that had been exposed for 4 weeks killed 83 and 74\%,
   respectively, of gravid Ae. aegypti in laboratory assays. These results
   indicate that mass trapping schemes using SLOs and BLOs are not rejected
   by the public and effectively target gravid Ae. aegypti. The impact of

Abstract = {Wild pollinators provide important services in both wild and

   wild bees to exotic floral species and novel habitat in a fragmented,

   Averaged across two seasonal sampling rounds, 45\% of the bee-borne
   pollen grains were identified to the species level. Wild bees in this
   system were very receptive to using alien plants for pollen foraging, at
   least 45\% of pollen sampled from bee specimens consisted of non-native
   pollen grains. During peak flowering in early summer, bees obtained at
   least 32\% of their pollen resources from within-fragment sources and at
   least 7.5\% from surrounding suburban residential yards. In midsummer,
   within-fragment sources represented 58\% of pollen sampled while yards
   dropped to 1.5\%. These bees appear to be more accepting of exotic
   floral species than of exotic habitat types (yards). The advantages and

Abstract = {Plant-derived essential oil products, in general, are considered
   minimum-risk pesticides and are exempt from Environmental Protection
   Agency registration under section 25(b) of the Federal Insecticide
   Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. However, many of the plant-derived
   essential products available to consumers (homeowners) have not been
   judiciously evaluated for both efficacy and plant safety. In fact,
   numerous plant-derived essential oil products labeled for control of
   arthropod pests have not been subject to rigorous evaluation, and there
   is minimal scientific information or supporting data associated with
   efficacy against arthropod pests. We conducted a series of greenhouse
   experiments to determine the efficacy and phytotoxicity of an array of
   plant-derived essential oil products available to consumers on arthropod
   pests including the citrus mealybug, Planococcus citri (Risso); western
   flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande); twospotted spider
   mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch; sweetpotato whitefly B-biotype, Bemisia
   tabaci (Gennadius); and green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer).
   Although the products Flower Pharm (cottonseed, cinnamon, and rosemary
   oil) and Indoor Pharm (soybean, rosemary, and lavender oil) provided
   >90\% mortality of citrus mealybug, they were also the most phytotoxic
   to the coleus, Solenostemon scutellarioides (L.) Codd, plants. Both
   GC-Mite (cottonseed, clove, and garlic oil) and Bugzyme (citric acid)
   were most effective against the twospotted spider mite (>= 90\%
   mortality). However, SMC (canola, coriander oil, and triethanolamine),
   neem (clarified hydrophobic extract of neem oil), and Bug Assassin
   (eugenol, sodium lauryl sulfate, peppermint, and citronella oil)
   provided >80\% mortality. Monterey Garden Insect Spray, which contained
   0.5\% spinosad, was most effective against western flower thrips with
   100\% mortality. All the other products evaluated failed to provide
   sufficient control of western flower thrips with <30\% mortality. In
   addition, the products Pest Out (cottonseed, clove, and garlic oil),
   Bang (Pipereaceae), and Fruit \& Vegetable Insect Spray (rosemary,
   cinnamon, clove oil, and garlic extract) had the highest flower
   (transvaal daisy, Gerbera jamesonii {[}H. Bolus ex Hook. f])
   phytotoxicity ratings (>= 4.5 of 5) among all the products. None of the
   plant-derived essential oil products provided sufficient control of
   sweetpotato whitefly B-biotype or green peach aphid 7, 14, and 21 d
   after application. Furthermore, the products Bug Assassin (eugenol,
   sodium lauryl sulfate, peppermint, and citronella oil) and Sharpshooter
   (sodium lauryl sulfate and clove oil) were phytotoxic to the poinsettia,
   Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd. ex Klotzsch, plants. This study is one of
   the first to quantitatively demonstrate that commercially available
   plant-derived essential oil products vary in their effectiveness against
   certain arthropod pests stated on the label and are phytotoxic.},

   METHODS: A total of 49,093 pesticide applicators were included in this
   analysis of the AHS, a prospective cohort study of licensed pesticide
   applicators in Iowa and North Carolina. Detailed information on
   pesticide exposure and lifestyle factors was obtained from
   self-administered questionnaires completed in 1993-1997. Average length
   of follow-up since applicator enrollment in the cohort was 9.14 years.
   We used two permethrin exposure metrics: a) lifetime days applicators
   personally mixed or applied permethrin and b) intensity-weighted
   lifetime days (lifetime days weighted by estimated intensity of
   exposure). We used Poisson regression analysis to estimate relative
   risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for malignancies by
   tertiles of exposure.
   RESULTS: We found no associations between permethrin and all malignant
   neoplasms combined, or between permethrin and melanoma, non-Hodgkin
   lymphoma, leukemia, or cancers of the colon, rectum, lung, or prostate.
   We found elevated and statistically significant risks for multiple
   myeloma in the highest tertiles of both lifetime exposure-days (RR =
   5.72; 95\% CI, 2.76-11.87) and intensity-weighted lifetime exposure-days
   (RR = 5.01; 95\% CI, 2.41-10.42), compared with applicators reporting
   they never used permethrin; these results are based on only 15 exposed
   cases. These findings were similar across a variety of alternative
   exposure metrics, exposure categories, and reference groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study found no association with most cancers analyzed.
   Although the suggested association with multiple myeloma was based on a
   small number of cases, it warrants further evaluation.},

Title = {EVALUATION OF AN AUTOMATIC-TIMED INSECTICIDE APPLICATION SYSTEM FOR
   BACKYARD MOSQUITO CONTROL},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Several manufacturers and pest management companies have begun to market
   and install outdoor automatically timed insecticide application systems
   that claim to provide an envelope of protection against host-seeking
   mosquitoes within a defined area, e.g., residential backyards. A typical
   system consists of a multi-gallon reservoir attached to a continuous
   loop of plastic tubing with multiple single spray head nozzles. Nozzles
   are usually placed along the perimeter of a backyard in landscaping or
   other areas suitable for mosquito harborage. This array is then
   connected to a programmable electric pump set to automatically apply an
   insecticide at predetermined intervals. An operational field study was
   conducted to evaluate this technology using previously installed
   MistAway (c) systems at 3 residences in northwestern Florida. This
   system applied a mist-like application of 0.05\% Al synergized
   pyrethrins for 45 sec a1 dawn and again at dusk in each backyard.
   Twice-weekly collections from ABC suction light traps, baited with
   carbon dioxide, were used as the evaluation tool. Female mosquitoes from
   treatment backyards were compared with trap collections from 3 backyards
   without automatic misting systems used as controls. We found that weekly
   mosquito reduction was highly variable and ranged from 98\% to 14\%
   during the 35-wk study. Because the primary method of reduction by these
   application systems was not well understood, a MistAway system was
   installed in an outdoor simulated residential backyard to determine
   exposure pathway under controlled conditions with field cage and
   excised-leaf bioassays. Using laboratory-reared females of Aedes
   albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus in those assays, we found that
   reduction by the MistAway system was primarily achieved by direct
   exposure of the mosquitoes ot the insecticide application and not from
   residual deposits on treated vegetation.},

Year = {2008},
Volume = {87},

Pages = {1-9},

Abstract = {We studied the richness and composition of diurnal birds in relation to
   the percentage of built surfaces in an urban area of Mediterranean
   France and analyzed their seasonal variation. We recorded 61 species and
   identified three species groups: those characteristic of areas with the
   highest proportion of buildings, those associated with a mixture of
   buildings and gardens, and those typical from the green spaces embedded
   in the urban matrix. Although species richness was lowest in the
   downtown area, where building density was highest, in the suburbs there
   was no relation between building density and species richness and
   overall species richness did not differ from the values observed in the
   woodlands and croplands imbedded in the urban matrix. Overall spatial
   species distribution was narrower in spring and broader in winter,
   suggesting that many bird species have a broader use of the urban
   landscape in winter. We observed the highest species turnover between
   spring and winter in the croplands and woodlands found within the urban
   matrix. In winter, the amount of bird life increased in the suburbs and
   decreased in croplands and woodlands, which suggests that residential
   areas provide winter habitats for more species. Our results suggest that
   a complex urban landscape can host a diverse bird community, including
   species of conservation value. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Volume = {81},

Abstract = {In mid 2003 a diverse floral resource was planted in a small urban
   residential plot at the University of California, Berkeley Oxford Tract
   with the goal of attracting local native California bee species to
   assess emerging patterns of diversity and seasonality. A standard
   procedure was then used in 2004 to sample the bees and monitor their
   host flowers. Pollen and nectar resources were abundant and consistently
   available during spring, summer, and early fall months of that year.
   Thirty-two bee species representing 17 genera, and five families used
   these resources through the 2004 season. Urban bees were categorized
   into three seasonalities: early season, late season, and full season
   represented by seven, eight, and 17 species respectively.
   Results of this study indicate that newly-planted urban gardens, which
   are designed for bees, have the potential to attract diverse seasonal
   bee taxa if diverse floral resources are provided throughout the growing
   season. Implications of these finding are discussed in terms of managing
   and conserving local bees in new and more developed urban gardens.

Abstract = {Urban and peri-urban agriculture (URA) provide about 10\% of the global
   food supply and have a significant potential to reduce poverty and
   increase food security in urban households. To characterize UPA types
   and intensities and to assess their resource use efficiencies,
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with 130 households actively
   involved in UPA in Niamey, Niger. The survey data indicated high use of
   livestock manure for vegetable gardening and to a lesser extent for the
   production of staple food. The URA livestock component depended heavily
   on the supply of live animals and feed from the rural hinterland. The
   application of organic and inorganic fertilizers in combination with the
   indiscriminate use Of nutrient-loaded wastewater for irrigation purposes
   led to important nutrient surpluses in URA gardens. First calculations
   of partial nutrient balances indicated that gaseous emission of
   nitrogenous compounds as well as leaching of nitrogen, phosphorus and
   potassium to the groundwater might be large. Insect attack and the lack
   of irrigation water or high labour needs for irrigation were identified
   respectively as major constraints to UPA gardening activities. Despite
   this, gardening proved to be the most economically beneficial occupation
   of the three main UPA activities. Lack of workforce and lack of cash to
   hire labour and purchase inputs constituted major constraints to millet
   farmers, as against soil fertility, which, in contrast to researchers,
   only a few farmers viewed as a major problem.},

Title = {Ethnophytotherapeutical research in the high Molise region
   (Central-Southern Italy)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Background: In the years 2003-2005 research was carried out concerning
   ethno-medicine in the high Molise (central-southern Italy), a region
   that has been the object of very little investigation from the
   ethnobotanical point of view. Upper Molise is a continuation of the
   mountain profiles of the Abruzzi Appenines: a series of hills, steep
   slopes and deep fluvial valleys making communications difficult.
   Primordial traditions (e.g. harvest feasts) are typical of the region.
   Methods: Field data were collected through open interviews in the field.
   These were conducted on both an individual and group level, fresh plants
   gathered from surrounding areas being displayed. In other cases,
   individual interviews were conducted by accompanying the person involved
   to the places where they perform their activities (for example, in the
   woods with woodcutters, kitchen gardens and fields with housewives,
   pastures with shepherds, etc.). In total 54 individuals were
   interviewed.
   Results: Data of 70 taxa belonging to 39 families were gathered. Among
   the species, 64 are used in human therapy, 5 as insect repellents, 11 in
   veterinary medicine, 1 to keep eggs and cheeses and 4 for magic
   purposes. The most important findings in ethno-medicine relate to the
   lichen Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm. (wounds) and to some vascular
   plant species: Asplenium trichomanes L. and Ceterach officinarum Willd.
   (to regularize menstruation), Cyclamen hederifolium (chilblains),
   Centaurium erythraea Rafn. and Pulmonaria apennina Cristof. \& Puppi
   (bruises), while in the ethno-veterinary field, we have Valeriana
   officinalis L. (wounds sustained by mules). Also worthy of note, given
   the isolation of the area, is the number of plants used to protect
   foodstuffs from parasites, among which Allium sativum L. and Capsicum
   frutescens L.
   Conclusion: The research revealed a deep-rooted and widespread habit of
   husbanding the family's resources. Whilst isolation and snowfalls
   contributed to the widespread knowledge of means of conserving
   foodstuffs, they also led to the use of products easily available within
   each home. The values of E. I. (ethnobotanicity index) for the upper
   Molise region are considered amongst the highest in Italian areas.
   Nevertheless, like the values for other areas of Italy, they are lower
   than those of many Spanish areas, perhaps (and not only) because of the
   more rapid cultural erosion experienced in Italy.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {142-148},
Abstract = {From 1995 to 1997, the larval habitats, seasonal abundance and behaviour
   of Aedes notoscriptus (Skuse) were studied in five western suburbs of
   Brisbane, south-east Queensland. At one suburb, Ae. notoscriptus
   immatures were found in 61.1\% and 47.3\% of premises, during winter and
   summer, respectively. Natural habitats, mainly bromeliad axils, garden
   accoutrements and discarded items accounted for 86\% and 81\% of
   infested containers in summer and winter, respectively. However, when
   larval productivity was accounted for, discarded household items and
   garden accoutrements were the most important container types. The
   Premise Condition Index (house condition, garden condition, shade cover)
   did not positively relate to the presence of Ae. notoscriptus larvae,
   nor to numbers of infested containers per premise. Similarly, the
   presence of inbuilt garden sprinkler systems could not be used as an
   indicator to predict premises that would be positive for Ae.
   notoscriptus immatures. The number of adult Ae. notoscriptus (21.3\% of
   total) collected using light traps was second to the number of Culex
   annulirostris (Skuse) (48.9\%) collected. These traps were unsuitable
   for monitoring Ae. notoscriptus during autumn and winter when Ae.
   notoscriptis activity shifted to the afternoon, and when traps were not
   operating. In terms of targeted approaches to control Ae. notoscriptus
   immatures, rubbish collection campaigns undertaken before the wet season
   should be focused on the removal of discarded household items, rubbish
   and tyres. Specific health education messages should be used to inform
   householders of the need to regularly clean or remove pot plant bases
   and bird baths. If effective, these methods could reduce Ae.
   notoscriptus larval densities by 70\% and 80\% during summer and winter
   months, respectively.},

Pages = {155-165},
Abstract = {We compared nest survival of three urban bird species over two seasons
   in Dunedin City: silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis). a recent
   self-introduced native that is very abundant; blackbirds (Turdus
   merula), all abundant exotic species: and fantails (Rhipidura
   fuliginosa), a native species that occurs in relatively low numbers in
   some urban habitats. We also used artificial nests to compare nest
   predation rates between residential gardens and bush fragments isolated
   within a residential matrix. Silvereye nests had highest survival (daily
   survival probability = 0.98). with early nests and nests situated higher
   in trees having higher Survival. Blackbird nest Survival was lower
   (0.966); higher nests had better survival. Fantail nest survival varied
   significantly between years (0.908 in 2006-07 and 0.987 in 2007-08).
   Predation was a major Cause of fantail nest failure, despite fantail
   nests being highest off the ground (mean = 4.2 m cf. 2.8 m for
   blackbirds and 2.2 m for silvereyes). Mortality of fantails during the
   week following fledging was high (41\%). Low nest and juvenile survival
   may result in low abundance of fantails in Dunedin City. Predation of
   artificial nests was unaffected by nest placement (central or peripheral
   in the tree/shrub) and was the same in gardens as in bush fragments,
   with rats (Rattus rattus), possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and possibly

Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We investigated the role of household exposure to pesticides
   in the etiology of childhood hematopoietic malignancies.
   METHODS: The national registry-based case-control study ESCALE (Etude
   sur les cancers de l'enfant) was carried out in France over the period
   2003-2004. Population controls were frequency matched with the cases on
   age and sex. Maternal household use of pesticides during pregnancy and
   Paternal use during pregnancy or childhood were reported by the mothers
   in a structured telephone questionnaire. Insecticides (used at home, on
   pets, or for garden crops), herbicides, and fungicides were
   distinguished. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) using unconditional
   regression models closely adjusting for age, sex, degree of
   urbanization, and type of housing (flat or house).
   RESULTS: We included a total of 764 cases of acute leukemia (AL), 130 of
   Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 166 of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and 1,681
   controls. Insecticide use daring pregnancy was significantly associated
   with childhood AL {[}OR = 2.1; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-2.51,
   both lymphoblastic and myeloblastic, NHL (OR = 1.8; 95\% Cl, 1.3-2.6),
   mainly for Burkitt lymphoma. (OR = 2.7; 95\% Cl, 1.6-4.5), and
   mixed-cell HL (OR = 4.1; 95\% Cl, 1.4-11.8), but not nodular sclerosis
   HL (OR = 1.1; 95\% Cl, 0.6-1.9). Paternal household use of pesticides
   was also related to AL (OR = 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.2-1.8) and NHL (OR = 1.7;
   95\% Cl, 1.2-2.6); but for AL the relationships did not remain after
   adjustment for maternal pesticide use during pregnancy.
   CONCLUSION: The study findings strengthen the hypothesis that domestic
   use,of pesticides may play a role in the etiology of childhood
   hematopoietic malignancies. The consistency of the findings with those
   of previous studies on AL raises the question of the advisability of
   preventing pesticide use by pregnant women.},

Volume = {140},
Number = {3-4},

Abstract = {In South-East Asia patterns of forest loss can predict the number of
   threatened birds. on the oceanic islands of Wallacea, small-scale
   agriculture, rather than commercial logging, is the main cause of forest
   loss and conversion, but few studies have directly examined their
   responses to land use. In 2001, 1 studied the birds of primary forest
   and anthropogenic gardens on the well-forested, and remote, Damar Island
   (198 km(2)) in the Banda Sea. Furthermore, I examined broad changes to
   the islands bird fauna by comparing baseline bird lists obtained in the
   19th century with 2001 data. The conversion of primary forest to garden
   resulted in substantial changes in avifaunal composition, and to the
   abundance of individual bird species, particularly to frugivorous and
   globally restricted-range species. Of 15 common birds, four were
   significantly more abundant in primary forest (blue-tailed imperial
   pigeon Ducula concinna, northern fantail Rhipidura rufiventris, golden
   whistler Pachycephala pectotalis and red-chested flowerpecker Dicaeum
   maugei) and one (scaly-breasted honeyeater Lichmera squamata) was more
   abundant in garden habitat. Incidental observations provided further
   evidence that many forest specialists (including the island endemic
   Damar flycatcher Ficedula henrici) rarely, if ever, used garden habitats
   notwithstanding its relative proximity. The number of resident birds
   recorded in 2001 (39) was similar to the 1890s (38), but six
   forest-dependent passe-rines were extirpated between samples. These
   losses are associated with the conversion of 25\% of the primary forest
   to modified habitat since the 1890s, but given the sparse species and
   environmental change data available it is impossible to definitively
   pinpoint this as the only cause underlying the species losses. This
   study demonstrates that remote and relatively well-forested islands are
   not immune to the threatening processes impacting bird populations
   elsewhere in South-East Asia. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is showing population declines in
   many parts of Europe, with recent declines being particularly severe in
   urban areas. To date, relatively little is known about the species'
   habitat associations within urbanized landscapes. We report here an
   investigation of the habitat associations of house sparrows using a
   survey of 1223 stratified randomly selected 500 x 500-m squares within
   urbanized landscapes of the UK, defined as at least 25\% ``human cover'.
   The densities of chirping male house sparrows and of all house sparrows
   were analysed separately to obtain insights into breeding habitat
   requirements and general habitat associations, respectively. Multi-model
   inference showed that residential areas (houses, flats), allotments
   (areas used for small-scale horticulture) and farm buildings were key
   predictors of house sparrow density and chirping male density. Separate
   analyses on landscapes of differing human cover showed similar results.
   Within residential areas, the increase of house sparrow density with
   habitat area (on a log scale) was approximately threefold greater when
   private gardens were present than when they were absent. The model
   predicted a rapid decline in house sparrow abundance when only a small
   area of private gardens is converted to continuous housing. Allotments
   and residential areas with gardens are likely to be under pressure due
   to increased demand for housing, specifically from the infilling of
   green space within urban areas. It would seem to be imperative that any
   action plan to protect urban house sparrow populations should include

Abstract = {This study evaluated azadirachtin and imidacloprid for their ability to
   reduce injury by Japanese beetles {[}Popillia japonica (Coleoptera:
   Scarabaeidae)] on floribunda-type roses (Rosa sp. `Acadia Sunrise'),
   either applied to foliage or as a soil drench. Roses were arranged in
   field plots and exposed to resident adult beetle populations.
   Insecticides were evaluated in field and laboratory trials. Laboratory
   assays of leaves collected from plants 14 days after soil applications
   of azadirachtin were less preferred by adult beetles than those
   collected from untreated controls. Plants in field trials that received
   soil treatments of either imidacloprid or azadirachtin had defoliation
   levels that were < 8\% throughout the entire season, whereas untreated
   control plants were 20\% defoliated. Addition of foliar sprays to soil
   applied insecticides provided no added protection to foliage. Rose
   blooms were more difficult to protect with both foliar and soil-applied
   insecticides. Bloom injury of untreated controls varied between 20\% and
   30\%, while plants receiving soil applications of azadirachtin varied
   between 0.2\% and 18\%. Soil applications of imidacloprid provided
   somewhat better protection of blooms with injury ranging between 0.2\%
   and 8\%. Foliar applications of azadirachtin gave no added protection to
   blooms of plants treated with imidacloprid. Adding carbaryl foliar
   treatments every 2 weeks improved control to < 2\% injury, a level that
   was comparable to weekly application of carbaryl. The potential for
   using soil-applied azadirachtin to reduce the need for foliar
   applications of carbaryl in rose gardens is discussed.},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {90},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Composting plant waste is a beneficial practice commonly used by
   American gardeners, but disposal of infested fruit directly into the
   environment creates a potential pathway for introduction of insect
   pests. This study estimates the likelihood of adult emergence for exotic
   fruit flies (Tephritidae) from residential composting in south Florida.
   Ripe grapefruits, Citrus x paradisi Macfad., were infested with the
   Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa (Loew). Half of the infested
   fruit was placed onto outdoor compost piles and half was maintained
   under controlled laboratory conditions. Adult fly emergence was recorded
   daily for 30 d from both the compost piles and control bins. Compost
   temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation were
   monitored, and the study was repeated 4 times under different seasonal
   conditions. Despite high mortality of flies from the composted fruit
   relative to control fruit, the overall risk of a potentially mated
   female emerging from composted fruit was calculated to be similar to
   10\%. Of the environmental factors evaluated, compost temperature was
   found to have a significant effect on adult emergence. Mortality
   approached 100\% in piles with maximum compost temperatures >= 48
   degrees C. This report provides experimental data in support of
   quantitative risk analysis for a tephritid-compost pathway.},

Abstract = {Capsule Bird species richness showed consistent positive correlations
   with site area and rough grass.
   Aim To determine those features of parks and other public green spaces
   that are of most importance in promoting bird species richness and to
   use this information to make recommendations for management of these
   areas.
   Methods Birds were counted in parks and other public green spaces within
   Greater London. Three survey visits were made in each of the periods
   summer 2002 and 2003 and winter 2002/03 and 2003/04. Habitat data were
   also collected.
   Results Site area was the most consistently significant variable related
   (positively) to total species richness. There were also positive effects
   of waterbodies and rough grass (including nettles and weed-rich areas).
   Species richness increased with a greater proportion of adjacent gardens
   in sites < 1 ha in size. There were negative associations with the
   presence of buildings. When considered by species group (woodland
   species, farmland species and habitat generalists), results were very
   similar to those for total species richness, except that there were no
   significant associations with presence of waterbodies.
   Conclusion Bird species richness is likely to be enhanced by increasing
   site area, and providing rough gross and waterbodies in urban green
   spaces. Such information could be especially useful in designing green
   spaces in new residential developments to maximize avian diversity.
   Surrounding habitats are also crucial determinants of bird species
   richness in parks.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE - To examine the association between pesticide use during
   pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) among wives of
   licensed pesticide applicators.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Using data from the Agricultural Health
   Study (AHS), we estimated the association between self-reported
   pesticide-related activities during the first trimester of the most
   recent pregnancy and GDM among 11,273 women whose pregnancy occurred
   within 25 years of enrollment.
   RESULTS - A total of 506 (4.5\%) women reported having had GDM. Women
   who reported agricultural pesticide exposure (mixing or applying
   pesticides to crops or repairing pesticide application equipment) during
   pregnancy were more likely to report GDM (odds ratio {[}OR] 2.2 {[}95\%
   CI 1.5-3.3]). We saw no association between residential pesticide
   exposure (applying pesticides in the home and garden during pregnancy)
   and GDM (1.0 {[}0.8-1.3]). Among women who reported agricultural
   exposure during pregnancy, risk of GDM was associated with ever-use of
   four herbicides (2,4,5-T 2,4,5-TP; atrazine or butylate) and three
   insecticides (diazinon, phorate, or carbofuran).
   CONCLUSIONS - These findings suggest that activities involving exposure
   to agricultural pesticides during the first trimester of pregnancy may
   increase the risk of GDM.},

Abstract = {Awareness in the eyes of the public is important for involving the wider
   community in conservation. A dragonfly awareness trail was developed and
   implemented in the year 2000 at a national botanical garden in South
   Africa. Such a trail is not likely to always have the same number of
   dragonfly species either throughout the year or from one year to the
   next. The aim was to assess dragonfly assemblage changes that occurred
   along the trail over 3 years, so as to fine-tune expectations that the
   public may have as regards species to be seen at any particular time. A
   cumulative species variance for species and speciesenvironmental
   relations, strongly indicated that certain measured site variables were
   responsible for the main variation in dragonfly species patterns over
   time. Habitat requirements of an odonate species may be defined
   primarily in terms of marginal grasses, floating and submerged
   vegetation, marginal herbs, sedges and reeds, and pH. Additional
   variables were percentage shade, exposed rock, marginal forest and water
   flow characteristics. Both dragonfly species richness and abundance
   changed over the 3 years. One of the reasons for this was a single,
   major disturbance, in the form of dredging the reservoir site to reverse
   ecological succession in 2002. Despite an impact such as this, and after
   accounting for vagrancy, there were in all 24 `core resident species'
   still to be seen along the trail from January to May. Another 11
   species, including two migrants and one species lost temporarily to
   dredging disturbance, can be considered only as `possibilities' on any
   one visit. Assurance that the 24 core species can be seen in the summer
   months (although only three in winter) is essential for maintaining the
   bona fide of such a trail, and hence conservation awareness, in the eyes
   of the public.},

Abstract = {Several epidemiological studies, particularly from the United States,
   have suggested health concerns may arise from the chronic exposure of
   young children to pesticides in their home environment. Most of these
   studies are retrospective and the available pesticide exposure
   information is either subject to the problem of recall or derived from
   surrogate information. Currently, little is known about the extent of
   pesticide use in homes and gardens in the UK. This was investigated in
   this study using a sample of parents from the Avon Longitudinal Study of
   Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort in and around Bristol. The level
   and extent of pesticide use by parents was explored through interviews
   that took place at the homes of the participants during August to
   November 2001, followed by an inventory of products stored in the home.
   From the results, 93\% of parents had used at least one pesticide over
   the preceding year with the highest use being in the garden, second
   inside the home, followed by treating pets and head lice. Most
   households reported using one to five different products over the past
   year, with a mean of 3.5. The frequency of pesticide use showed that a
   minority of parents are using pesticides in the high frequency range.
   Over 85 different pesticide products were found to be stored in 76\% of
   homes, with 76 different types of pesticide active ingredients.
   Insecticides were the most commonly used and stored pesticide. (c) 2006

Abstract = {The purpose of the study was to assess non-dietary exposure of workers

   (OP) pesticides. In total, 21 workers from different occupational places
   (two greenhouses, three florist shops and three veterinary departments)
   and 20 subjects assumed to be non-occupationally exposed were recruited.
   Indoor air, hand wipes, and three first morning urine samples were
   collected. Seven OPs were measured by GC/ECD and GC/TSD, and six urinary
   dialkylphosphate metabolites by GC/PFPD. All indoor air samples from the
   workplaces and only one-third of the samples from the residences
   contained at least one of the seven OPs. However, almost all
   participants were dermally exposed to OPs. Total OP indoor air and
   cutaneous levels were significantly higher for workers than for the
   general population (air median = 185 pmol/m(3) Versus nondetectable, P<
   0.0001; hands median = 1250 pmol/hands versus 475 pmol/hands, P = 0.03).
   From the air, gardeners and florists were mainly exposed to methyl-OPs
   and veterinary staff to ethyl-OPs (mainly diazinon). From their hands,
   all subjects were exposed to methyl-OPs, with gardeners and florists
   exposed to somewhat but not significantly higher levels. Ethyl-OPs were
   more found frequently and at higher levels on the hands of veterinary
   workers. Total OP levels in indoor air and from hand wipes were
   significantly correlated (Spearman R = 0.34, P = 0.03). DAP detection
   frequencies and levels were not different between workers and the
   general population (workers median = 168 nmol/g creat and general
   population median = 241 nmol/g creat, P=0.31), and did not correlate
   with air or hand levels. Subjects not occupationally exposed showed
   significant residential exposure to OPs, more frequently from their
   hands than from the air. Different occupations were associated with
   different exposure profiles and levels. The lack of differences in DAP
   levels between the different groups of exposure suggests that dietary
   exposure to OP residues and exposure to other OPs are involved.},

Volume = {77},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Bird fauna of the Madrid province (Central Spain) was analyzed according
   to urban development in a landscape mosaic of 700 km(2). Bird
   distribution and abundance was studied in urban versus several rural
   habitats and along a gradient of urban typologies. By means of tree
   regression analyses we identified the most important habitat structure
   variables affecting bird species richness and density in urban
   environments. Bird communities in urban environments were globally less
   diverse and had higher densities than any natural habitat of the study
   region. The number of urban-avoider species (n = 37) was greater than
   the number of species favoured by urban habitats (n = 8). Current
   housing developments of extense crowded terraced-houses, with shortage
   of gardens, supported the least diverse and dense bird populations.
   Nevertheless, differences in bird species abundance between urban and
   natural habitats mitigated in many species when considering the older
   gardened developments. The plots with the highest species richness
   (average of 14.5 spp./0.8 ha) were those with 15-28\% of building cover,
   more than 43 medium-sized trees/ha (10-30 cm dbh), and 13-54 small
   trees/ha (less than 10 cm dbh). Subsequently, future land-use planning
   should stress the exclusion of urban developments from the most valuable
   habitats, such as open wooded valley areas devoted to cattle-grazing
   (mainly ash-groves), and the negative effect of dense, low-gardened
   housing developments. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Data about non-dietary exposure to different chemical classes of
   pesticides are scarce, especially in France. Our objective was to assess
   residential pesticide exposure of non-occupationally exposed adults, and
   to compare it with occupational exposure of subjects working indoors.
   Twenty unexposed persons, five gardeners, seven florists and nine
   veterinary workers living in Paris area were recruited. Nineteen
   residences, two greenhouses, three florist shops and three veterinary
   departments were then sampled. Thirty-eight insecticides, herbicides and
   fungicides were measured in indoor air with an air sampler for 24 It,
   and on hands by wiping them with isopropanol-wetted swabs. After
   extraction, samples were analysed by gas and high-performance liquid
   chromatography. Seventeen different pesticides were detected at least
   once in indoor air and twenty-one on the hands. An average of 4.2 +/-
   1.7 different pesticides was detected per indoor air sample. The
   organochlorines lindane, alpha-endosulfan and alpha-HCH were the most
   frequently detected compounds, in 97\%, 69\% and 38\% of the samples,
   respectively. The organophosphates dichlorvos and fenthion, the
   carbamate propoxur and the herbicides atrazine and alachlor were
   detected in more than 20\% of the air samples. Indoor air concentrations
   were often low, but could reach 200-300 ng/m(3) in residences for
   atrazine and propoxur. Propoxur levels significantly differed between
   the air of veterinary places and other places (Kruskal-Wallis test, p <
   0.05) and dieldrin levels between residences and workplaces (p < 0.05).
   There was a greater number of pesticides on hands than in air, with an
   average of 6.3 +/- 3.3 different pesticides detected per sample, the
   most frequently detected being malathion, lindane and trifluralin, in
   more than 60\% of the subjects. Maximal levels (up to 1000-3000
   ng/hands) were observed either in the general population or in workers,
   depending on the pesticide. However, no significant difference was
   observed between workers and general population handwipe pesticide
   levels. As expected, gardeners were exposed to pesticides sprayed in
   greenhouses. Florists and veterinary workers, whose pesticide exposure
   had not been described until now, were also indirectly exposed to
   pesticides used for former pest control operations. Overall, general
   population was exposed to more various pesticides and at levels
   sometimes higher than in occupational places. The most frequent
   pesticides in residences were not the same as in US studies but levels
   were similar. These preliminary results need to be confirmed in a
   greater number of residences from different parts of the country, in
   order to better assess pesticide exposure of the general population and
   its influencing factors. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Pesticides are widely used in the home and garden to kill insects, weeds
   and other unwanted pests. There is mounting evidence that this usage may
   also have health consequences particularly on children. Using the ALSPAC
   cohort of 13,391 families with self-reported usage data up to age 4
   years of the study child, the main users of pesticides appeared to be
   older, Caucasian, better educated, have higher incomes and more likely
   to own their home or to belong to non-manual social classes compared to
   less frequent users. There was some suggestion that different factors
   may affect weed-killer compared to other pesticide use. In particular,
   income appeared unrelated to other pesticide use. This may reflect
   different attitudes to indoor compared to garden applications.
   Alternatively, it may reflect whether the main user was the mother or
   the partner. Some authorities are currently encouraging domestic users
   to consider other non-chemical means of pest control before using
   pesticides. These results may help in targeting particular groups if
   further reductions in pesticide usage are desired. They have also helped
   in identifying the important confounders for adjusting future analyses
   on the potential health consequences of pesticides and weed-killers.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the relation between childhood acute
   leukaemia and household exposure to pesticides.
   Methods: The study included 280 incident cases of acute leukaemia and
   288 controls frequency matched on gender, age, hospital, and ethnic
   origin. The data were obtained from standardised face to face interviews
   of the mothers with detailed questions on parental occupational history,
   home and garden insecticide use, and insecticidal treatment of
   pediculosis. Odds ratios were estimated using unconditional regression
   models including the stratification variables parental socioeconomic
   status and housing characteristics.
   Results: Acute leukaemia was observed to be significantly associated
   with maternal home insecticide use during pregnancy (OR = 1.8, 95\% Cl
   1.2 to 2.8) and during childhood (OR = 1.7, 95\% Cl 1.1 to 2.4), with
   garden insecticide use (OR = 2.4, 95\% Cl 1.3 to 4.3), and fungicide use
   (OR = 2.5, 95\% Cl 1.0 to 6.2) during childhood. Insecticidal shampoo
   treatment of pediculosis was also associated with childhood acute
   leukaemia (OR = 1.9, 95\% Cl 1.2 to 3.3).
   Conclusion: The results reported herein support the hypothesis that
   various types of insecticide exposure may be a risk factor for childhood
   acute leukaemia. The observed association with insecticidal shampoo
   treatment of pediculosis, which has never been investigated before,
   requires further study.},

Volume = {46},

Pages = {1239-1249},
Abstract = {Weekly data from the urban and rural environments of numerous Australian
   inland towns were used to assess the impact of urban environments on the
   potential growth rate of the Queensland fruit fly. The urban
   environments were warmer and more moist than adjacent rural
   environments, making rural landscapes less attractive for fruit fly.
   Further analysis of climatic data revealed an acute negative water
   balance during the summer season. Under this harsh environment, the
   health and greenness of urban backyards and parks is maintained with
   frequent use of urban irrigation. This study aims to quantify the impact
   of urban hydrology on environmental conditions for the population
   potential of Queensland fruit fly in south-eastern New South Wales.
   CLIMEX, a climate-driven simulation model, was used in this study.
   Results indicated that throughout the winter season, low temperatures
   kept the Queensland fruit fly under control, irrespective of any other
   factor, including favourable moisture conditions. During summer,
   moisture was the major limiting factor. Even partial irrigation reduced
   the limiting effects of the deficiency of rainfall often experienced
   during midsummer. Irrigation also resulted in a large increase in the
   duration of the favourable period for the potential growth of fruit fly
   and an almost complete removal of unfavourable periods. When irrigation
   water was applied at optimal or excessive levels, the duration of
   favourable conditions for the Queensland fruit fly extended beyond the
   summer season. For the Queensland fruit fly, towns appear to be oases
   compared with the surrounding rural desert. Queensland fruit fly is
   unlikely to travel freely between towns, minimising chances of
   reinvasion once a resident population has been eliminated.},

Abstract = {Animals are often confronted with environmental challenges and the way
   in which they cope with these challenges can have important fitness
   consequences. There is increasing evidence that individuals differ
   consistently in their reaction to the environment (personality traits).
   However, little is known about whether different life-styles (e.g.,
   resident or migratory) influence personality traits and if so, in what
   manner.
   We compared neophobic and exploratory behaviours, both of which play an
   important role in personality traits, between two closely related
   species, the resident Sardinian warblers and the migratory garden
   warblers, at two different times during the year. Neophobia was tested
   by placing it novel object, a mop, beside the feeding dish and measuring
   the latency to feed (neophobia score). Exploration was tested by
   offering another novel object, a tube, attached to a perch at it neutral
   location and measuring latency to approach and investigate the tube
   (exploration score). Both tests were carried out at the end of the
   breeding season and repeated ten months later in spring. The Sardinian
   warblers showed consistent behavioural reactions over time. Furthermore,
   neophobia and exploration scores were negatively related. The garden
   warblers neither behaved consistently over time nor was there it
   correlation between neophobia and exploration. Overall, Sardinian
   warblers were less neophobic and more explorative than garden warblers.
   The different reactivity may be due to a different frequency
   distribution of the individuals of the two species along a reactivity
   axis.
   It can be concluded that the Sardinian warblers have personality traits.
   The situation is less clear in the garden warblers. Possibly, different
   life-styles require different organisation of behaviours.},

Abstract = {1. Wild birds are commonly observed in private residential gardens in
   Great Britain. However, little is known about how their use of this
   significant and increasingly important habitat is changing and how such
   changes relate to their population status.
   2. Trends in the use of private residential gardens by wild birds in
   Great Britain were investigated using weekly bird records from 18 300
   gardens over 8 years.
   3. We showed that the use of this habitat is seasonal and cyclic, with
   the timing and regularity of its periodicity variable between species.
   4. We evaluated the significance of the underlying trends in the cyclic
   reporting rates. Eighteen species showed clear trends, the three with
   the most negative year term parameter estimates being `red-listed' as
   high conservation concern.
   5. Examining correlations with national scale survey data suggested that
   garden reporting rates are related to general population trends in a
   number of species, including several of conservation importance. Other
   species exhibit important differences between national and garden
   trends.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis demonstrates ecologically
   meaningful trends and provides novel insights into seasonal cycles of
   habitat exploitation, using relatively simple and cost-effectively
   collected data. This will lead to greater understanding of the
   relationships between gardens and general bird populations and of the
   times of year at which garden habitats are most important for birds. We
   have demonstrated the practicality and productivity of `citizen science'
   in this context, and provided new information on the status of some
   birds of conservation concern.},

Abstract = {Migratory birds stay in a particular area for only short periods and
   must rapidly acquire appropriate information about stopover sites. In
   contrast, resident birds can update their knowledge whenever necessary.
   In a novel environment migrants are thus predicted to assess relevant
   information faster than nonmigrants. We tested this prediction with two
   closely related species, the migratory garden warbler, Sylvia borin, and
   the resident Sardinian warbler, S. melanocephala momus. Each bird was
   allowed to explore two unfamiliar boxes, one of which contained food.
   Garden warblers found food significantly faster than Sardinian warblers.
   Garden warblers may have a wide-area exploration strategy to assess a
   novel room and Sardinian warblers may have a local-area exploration
   strategy. We conclude that a wide-area exploration strategy might be
   required for migrants to assess environmental information as rapidly as
   possible. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   Aims To determine the numbers of birds nesting on or in houses and

   Methods A questionnaire survey of 12 687 households in Great Britain was
   conducted in 2000, of which 6035 responded. A follow-up survey, to which
   1757 responded, showed that people with no nests on their properties had
   been less likely to respond in the initial survey than had those with
   nests; it allowed this bias to be corrected. Sampling intensity differed
   regionally and by house-type (detached, semidetached, terraced);
   national population estimates were corrected to allow for this. The
   analysis was restricted to the 17 species that nested most frequently in
   domestic properties and to four others.
   Results It is likely that our estimates were somewhat too high for ten
   of the species. Even allowing for this, it is clear that the number of
   birds nesting in built-up areas is substantially higher than previously
   estimated for 13 of the 2 1 species. For some of these species, this has
   led in the past to significant underestimation of the total British
   population.
   Conclusions For some of the commonest British birds, accurate estimates
   of national populations are only possible if we get better estimates of
   numbers nesting in built-up areas than we have had in the past.},

   Results-The risk of TCC was significantly increased among dogs exposed

   dogs exposed to lawns or gardens treated with insecticides alone (OR,

   tested this hypothesis in hand-raised Garden Warblers (Sylvia borin),
   long-distance migrants, which normally do not experience great

   groups of birds under cold and warm conditions for 5 months, during
   which their body mass and food intake were monitored. When relatedness
   (siblings vs. non-siblings) of the experimental birds was taken into
   account, body mass in cold-acclimated birds was higher than in
   warm-acclimated birds. BMR, measured at the end of the 5-month
   temperature treatment, was also higher in the cold- than the
   warm-acclimated group. Migrant birds thus seem to be capable of the same

Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {160-165},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Prior studies have shown that macrogeographic gradients in temperature
   associated with latitude and altitude can lead to countergradient
   patterns of variation in a number of taxa: individuals from colder
   environments are known to grow or develop faster than their conspecifics
   from warmer environments when placed in a common setting. In this study,
   I hypothesized that countergradient variation also is important at
   microgeographic scales. The wood frog, Rana sylvatica, breeds in
   open-canopied, temporary wetlands as well as those heavily shaded by
   vegetation. Shading leads to cooler thermal environments that are
   associated with embryonic development rates as much as 50\% slower than
   those in unshaded wetlands. Wetlands with contrasting canopy
   environments are often found within tens or hundreds of meters of each
   other. In a common garden experiment, embryos from nearby natural
   wetlands displayed countergradient variation: individuals collected from
   shaded wetlands developed up to 12\% faster than those collected from
   relatively unshaded wetlands. The results of this study suggest that the
   concept of countergradient variation may be extended to small scales of
   space. In addition, the rate and scale of vegetation dynamics (the agent
   of wetland shading) imply that divergence in development among residents
   of nearby wetlands may be relatively rapid, on the order of decades.},

Abstract = {A survey of Australian Magpies, Gymnorhina tibicen, in Kings Park,
   Perth, Western Australia, in 1938 identified 84 individuals in nine
   groups. The survey was repeated 62 years later in 2000 and identified 98
   magpies in 19 groups. The sex and age composition of the population
   during the two surveys was broadly similar, with 69\% of the birds in
   1938 classed as adult and 75\% in 2000. In 1938, 31\% of the population
   were adult males and 38\% adult females compared with 40\% and 35\%
   respectively in 2000. Seven of the areas occupied by groups in 1938 were
   also occupied by one or more groups in 2000. The greater number of
   groups in 2000 is partly due to two or more groups occupying areas used
   by one in 1938. Also in 2000, several groups occupied parts of Kings
   Park where no magpies were recorded in 1938, but the territories of two
   groups in 1938 were unoccupied in 2000. In part, the increase in the
   number of magpies and groups since 1938 is the result of clearing large
   areas of bushland and replacing it with lawns and gardens, thereby
   creating more habitat for magpies. The remainder of the increase may be
   the result of more regular watering of lawns and gardens in the park,
   increasing the food resources available to magpies as water supplies
   improved. The areas not used in 2000 may have become too densely
   vegetated or affected by increased traffic on the main road along the
   park's northern boundary, which may restrict movements of magpies
   between the park and the lawns and parks of the adjoining residential
   area.},

Abstract = {It has been hypothesized that organisms living at different latitudes or
   in different environments adjust their metabolic activity to the
   prevailing conditions. However, do differences in energy turnover simply
   represent a phenotypic adaptation to the local environment, or are they
   genetically based? To test this, we obtained nestling stonechats
   (Saxicola torquata) from equatorial Kenya (0degrees N), Ireland
   (51.5degrees N), Austria (47.5degrees N) and Kazakhstan (51.5degrees N).
   Birds were hand-raised and kept in Andechs, Germany. We measured their
   resting metabolic rates (RMR) and locomotor activity at an age of ca. 14
   months (July) and 20 months (January), when birds went through
   postnuptial moult (July), and neither moulted nor exhibited enlarged
   gonads or migratory activity (January). RMR was generally higher during
   moult, but differed among populations: RMR was lowest in the resident
   Kenyan birds, higher in mostly sedentary Irish birds, and highest in
   migratory Austrian and Kazakhstan birds. Thus our data demonstrate that
   even in birds kept from early life under common-garden conditions, the
   `pace of life', as indicated by metabolic turnover, is lower in
   sedentary tropical than in north-temperate migratory individuals of the
   same species. Such intrinsically low energy expenditure in sedentary
   tropical birds may have important implications for slow development,
   delayed senescence and high longevity in many tropical organisms.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1085-1098},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ground cover is used in some vineyards to improve soil structure and
   help manage insect pests; previous studies have shown lower leafhopper
   (Erythroneura spp.) densities on vines grown with ground cover. We
   under-took a 2-yr study to determine why ground cover is associated with
   reduced leafhopper densities. Ground cover consisted of a fall-planted
   cover crop of purple vetch (Vicia benghalensis) and barley (Hordeum
   vulgare), which senesced in May and was replaced by a complex of
   resident vegetation comprised primarily of the grasses Echinochloa spp.,
   Digitaria sanguinalis, and Setaria spp., as well as common knotweed
   (Polygonum aviculare). We compared three treatments during the growing
   season: Cover, No Cover, and Cover/Exclusion, Cover/Exclusion was
   similar to Cover treatment but with barriers to impede arthropod
   movement between ground cover and vines. We measured leafhopper density
   and egg parasitism, spider density and diversity, and grapevine vigor,
   and found that mid- and late-season leafhopper densities were
   significantly lower in Cover versus No Cover. Neither leafhopper egg
   parasitism nor spider density on the vines or ground cover could explain
   these differences; however, grapevine vigor was significantly lower in
   Cover than No Cover, and provides the best correlation to leafhopper
   density. Late-season leafhopper density was highest in the Exclusion
   treatment but cannot be explained by changes in grapevine vigor.
   Individual spider species composition and density on the grapevine
   canopy varied significantly among treatments: Trachelas pacificus
   (Chamberlin and Ivie) was higher in the Cover treatment, Hololena nedra
   Chamberlin and Ivie, Cheiracanthium inclusum (Hentz), and Neoscona
   oaxacensis (Keyserling) were lower in the Exclusion treatment, and
   Oxyopes spp. was higher in the Exclusion treatment. We suggest the lower
   densities of leafhoppers in the Cover treatment resulted from poorer
   host plant quality because of the competition between ground cover and
   grapevines. The higher late-season leafhopper densities in the Exclusion
   treatment may be due to changes in spider species composition, and
   subsequently, differences in rates of predation on leafhopper nymphs.},

Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {338-348},

Abstract = {The influence of environmental stochasticity and dispersal in producing
   patterns in population synchrony was examined for 53 woods censused
   annually from 1990 to 1999 for nine resident bird species (wren
   Troglodytes troglodytes, dunnock Prunella modularis, robin Erithacus
   rubecula, blackbird Turdus merula, song thrush Turdus philomelos,
   long-tailed tit Aegithalos caudatus, blue tit Parus caeruleus, great tit
   Parus major, and chaffinch Fringilla coelebs) and four migrant bird
   species (garden warbler Sylvia borin, blackcap Sylvia atricapilla,
   chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita and willow warbler Phylloscopus
   trochilus). Twelve species showed global synchrony of population counts
   due to regional population trends and widespread annual population
   fluctuations. There was a clear link between population fluctuations and
   winter weather for wren, and three other species showed their largest
   population declines after the coldest winters. Eight species showed a
   decline in synchrony with distance between woods, and there was evidence
   for dispersal causing this pattern in three species. Landscape structure
   affected patterns of synchrony in several species, with lower synchrony
   in landscapes with less woodland. For three species, this difference in
   synchrony across a landscape gradient of decreasing woodland cover
   accounted for the decline in synchrony over distance. Three species
   showed greater synchrony between woods with similar amounts of hedgerow
   in the surrounding landscape, suggesting that the surroundings of a wood
   influence the population dynamics of some species breeding in the wood.
   Habitat fragmentation can alter the processes contributing to population
   synchrony. Loss of woodland reduces the relative abundance of woodland
   bird species. The remaining patches of habitat are smaller, more
   isolated and are set in a more hostile landscape, all of which may
   disrupt dispersal between patches and alter the population dynamics
   within woods.},

   a 4:1:8 mixture of 1 octen-3-ol, 3-n-propylphenol, and 4-methylphenol

   weekly average of <500 midges per lure-baited trap, reduction occurred
   more frequently. Midge reduction did not appear to be species specific.},

   US\$8-10 million were spent. About 70\% of termite treatments were done
   on residential premises, 20\% on industrial buildings and 10\% on
   commercial buildings. The most important species are Coptotermes
   travians, C. curvignathus, C. havilandi C. kalshoveni and C.
   sepangensis. C. curvignathus which usually attack houses built in areas
   where rubber trees (Hevea brasilliensis) were previously planted, while
   C. travians is mainly found in urban buildings. Other subterranean and
   mound-building species that are found around living premises, urban
   gardens and parklands, but usually do not attack structures include
   Macrotermes gilvus, Macrotermes carbonarius, Globitermes sulphureus,
   Microtermes pakistanicus, Microcerotermes spp. and Odontotermes spp.
   Control of subterranean termites in Malaysia currently relies heavily on
   pre- and post-construction soil treatments. Dusting is also commonly
   done in buildings. The ban in 1998 on chlordane usage as a soil
   termiticide, has caused pest control operators to opt for
   organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides. Field evaluations of
   hexaflumuron baits against various Coptotermes species in natural
   habitats and in buildings showed very promising results. The activity of
   all baited termite colonies diminished within 70 days of bait
   application with the total amount of hexaflumuron consumed being less
   than 1.5 g. The potential of baiting and challenges to termite control

Abstract = {The IUCN/SSC Status Survey ann Conservation Action Plan: Dragonflies
   calls for an increase in educating the public and increasing awareness
   of dragonflies (Odonata). Dragonflies are conspicuous and attractive,
   and can `stand in' for other invertebrates in raising awareness of the
   necessity to conserve invertebrates. While reserves have been set aside
   for dragonfly awareness and conservation in the northern hemisphere, no
   such dragonfly reserves appear to exist in the southern hemisphere,
   despite its rich dragonfly fauna. This paper describes the development
   of a dragonfly-awareness trail in an established and well-visited
   botanical garden (The National Botanical Gardens, Pietermaritzburg,
   South Africa). Correlations between species and environmental variables
   were significantly high for six measured environmental variables: pH,
   percentage shade, vegetation (structural and compositional), ambient and
   water temperature, and water depth. Multivariate analyses of data,
   classified 20 a priori selected sampling units into four ecologically
   meaningful biotope types, each with a characteristic dragonfly
   assemblage. The four biotopes provided potential viewing points. To
   these were added a further three duplicate biotopes so as to link the
   trail into a circuit. Questionnaires assessed public awareness of
   dragonflies, and helped design a preliminary leaflet. A final trail
   design was drawn up along with an expanded booklet. The trail has now
   been implemented. Recommendations are made an the minimal scientific
   underpinning required for future trail design. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {A survey of Georgia homeowners provided insights about their use of

   needed to develop a best management practices manual to be used by
   Master Gardeners to train the general public through the existing
   outreach programs. The objective of the training program is to reduce
   nutrient runoff and garden chemicals and improve the quality of surface
   water in urban watersheds. Results showed three of four homeowners did
   their own landscaping and, therefore, fully controlled the amount of
   applied chemicals and the area of application. Fertilizers were
   primarily applied to lawns, but a high percentage of homeowners also
   applied them to trees, shrubs, and flowers. Insecticides were applied by
   a larger percentage of homeowners than herbicides. Control of fire ants
   (Solenopsis invicta) was likely the reason behind the frequent use of
   insecticides. The desire for a weed free lawn was the plausible
   motivation behind the use of herbicides, which were used mostly on
   lawns. Fungicide use was infrequently reported by Georgia homeowners.
   The pattern of fertilizer and pesticide use suggests that the developed
   manual should emphasize techniques and cultural practices, which could
   lower the dependence on chemicals, while ultimately assuring the desired
   appearance of turf and ornamental plants.},

Abstract = {We compared the species richness and abundance of pollinator
   (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) communities in two seasons (September 1998 and
   April 1999) among four types of urban land use in the Phoenix, Arizona,
   USA, metropolitan area (xeriscaped residential yards, mesiscaped
   residential yards, urban desert-remnant parks, and natural desert parks
   on the fringe of the metropolitan area). Richness and abundance of bees
   were generally lower in residential areas than in desert areas, with
   desert areas on the fringe of the metro area possessing the highest
   diversity of all sites. Residential yards that utilized xeric
   landscaping had a more diverse bee community (with proportionally more
   rare species) than did mesic (turf grass) yards, particularly in late
   summer (September). Although bee community structure was apparently
   unaffected by the density of local habitat features (native and exotic
   trees, shrubs, cacti, and herbaceous plants in addition to human-built
   structures), the types of habitat features do appear to influence the
   number and types of bees present in an area. These results suggest that
   urban development can be designed to promote the conservation of bees.
   Specifically, preservation of desert and greater use of xeric
   landscaping rather than mesiscaping may help preserve this ecologically
   and economically vital group of organisms.},

Abstract = {Trichogramma parasitoids are a commonly released biological control
   agent against Lepidopteran pests. In vineyards in south-eastern
   Australia, Trichogramma carverae is released to control lightbrown apple
   moth (Epiphyas postvittana), a pest of grapevines. Sulfur is also
   sprayed on the vines to control powdery mildew and mites. Our
   experiments aimed to assess the potential impact of sulfur use on
   released and resident Trichogramma species (T. carverae, T. funiculatum)
   and to devise a protocol to maximise the potential of Trichogramma and
   optimally integrate the use of chemicals with biocontrol. Laboratory and
   field studies indicate that sulfur is harmful to adults and to immature
   stages contained within hosts where it increases mortality and reduces
   fitness of the emerged wasps. Persistence trials showed that release of
   Trichogramma 6 days after sulfur spraying will reduce the effects on
   released organisms. To reduce the impact on resident Trichogramma, other
   chemicals will need to be used.},

Abstract = {Most studies of the health effects of pesticides have concentrated on
   occupational exposure. Little is known about community environmental
   exposure to agricultural pesticides. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate nonoccupational pesticide exposure among farmers' families
   in rural El Salvador, a country known for intensive use of extremely
   toxic compounds. The study population included all residents 8 years and
   older living in five agricultural communities in El Salvador. Current
   exposure to organophosphate insecticides (OPs) was established through
   analysis of urine samples for alkyl phosphate metabolites of OPs. Nearly
   half of 358 analyzed samples had detectable levels of OP metabolities.
   Of subjects not performing agricultural fieldwork, 30\% nonetheless
   excreted detectable levels of metabolities. Similar rates held for
   children and adults. The best independent predictors for an individual's
   excretion of OP metabolites were (a) performing fieldwork during the
   past 2 weeks, (b) the head household farmer's application of OPs during
   the past 2 years, and (c) the household mother reporting use of OPs in
   the home or yard. The latter factors were significantly associated with
   metabolite excretion regardless of whether the individual had done
   fieldwork. The results of this study support the hypothesis that a large
   proportion of rural Salvadorans, including: children, is exposed to
   pesticides through environmental as well as occupational routes. (C)

Abstract = {Outdoor residential pesticide use has different economic motivations
   than agricultural pesticide use. During the past 20 years, pesticides
   for nonstructural pests have been applied on residential landscapes of
   about 50\% of all U.S. households. But the number of people who pay for
   professional treatments has been growing. Households that use outdoor
   pesticides are more likely to have yards, bigger or better-quality
   yards, lower pest tolerances, more pestiferous surroundings, or less
   concern about risks of pesticidal exposure. Professional pest control
   becomes more attractive as the costs of household time, equipment, or
   exposure increase or as the benefits of professional time, expertise,
   equipment, or a restricted pesticide increase. In general, households
   are less likely than farmers to use pesticides, read labels, and take
   precautions. They apply herbicides at higher rates and insecticides at
   lower rates than most farmers. These behavioral differences reflect
   differences in the objectives and degree of market orientation of pest
   control, the scale of operations, and regulation. Our economic
   perspective, together with scientific information on pest management,
   can be useful for creating better pest management policies to reduce
   adverse environmental or public-health impacts.},

Title = {Influence of ground cover on spider populations in a table grape
   vineyard},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-40},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1. Cover crops and/or resident ground vegetation have been used in
   California Vineyards to increase the number of predators and decrease
   the number of pestiferous herbivores. The most common resident predators
   in vineyards are spiders (Araneae). Several observational studies
   suggest that the addition of cover crops results in an increase in
   spider density and a decrease in insect pest densities.
   2. To test experimentally the effects of cover crops and/or resident
   ground vegetation (hereafter collectively referred to as ground cover)
   on spider populations, a 3-year study was undertaken in a commercial
   vineyard. Large, replicated plots were established with and without
   ground cover during the growing season. Spider species diversity was
   analysed on the vines and on the ground cover.
   3. On the vines, there was no significant difference in spider species
   richness or the total number of spiders in plots with and without ground
   cover. There were differences in the relative abundance of two spiders
   between treatments, with one species (Trachelas pacificus {[}Chamberlin
   \& Ivie]) more abundant in plots with ground cover and another (Hololena
   nedra Chamberlin \& Ivie) more common on vines in plots with no ground
   cover. Annual variation in spider abundance was greater than variation
   due to ground cover treatment.
   4. On the ground cover, the spider species diversity was considerably
   different from that found on the vines above, suggesting that there is
   Little movement of spiders between the ground cover and the vines.
   Enhancement of ir: pacificus populations on vines with ground covers may
   be a result of prey species movement between the ground cover and the
   vines. Spider abundance was sparse on the bare ground.
   5. The maintenance of ground cover increased spider species diversity in
   the vineyard as a whole (vine and ground cover). However, the relatively
   small changes in spider abundance on the vines indicate there are
   limitations in the use of ground covers for pest management with respect
   to generalist predators.},

Abstract = {Potential health effects of agricultural pesticide use include
   reproductive outcomes. For the Ontario Farm Family Health Study, the
   authors sampled Ontario farms from the 1986 Canadian Census of

   concerning farm activities, reproductive health experience, and chemical
   applications, Male farm activities in the period from 3 months before
   conception through the month of conception were evaluated in relation to
   miscarriage, preterm delivery, and small-for-gestational-age births.
   Among the 1,898 couples with complete data (64\% response), 3,984
   eligible pregnancies were identified. Miscarriage was not associated
   with chemical activities overall but was increased in combination with
   reported use of thiocarbamates, carbaryl, and unclassified pesticides on
   the farm, Preterm delivery was also not strongly associated with farm
   chemical activities overall, except for mixing or applying yard
   herbicides (odds ratio = 2.1, 95\% confidence interval 1.0-4.4),
   Combinations of activities with a variety of chemicals (atrazine,
   glyphosate, organophosphates, 4-{[}2,4-dichlorophenoxy] butyric acid,

Title = {Facultative helping does not influence reproductive success or survival
   in cooperatively breeding white-browed scrubwrens},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {66},
Number = {5},
Pages = {658-670},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {1, The most common form of cooperative breeding in birds involves a pair
   and their adult offspring ('helpers') provisioning young, Many studies
   show that pairs with helpers have higher reproductive success than pairs
   alone, but the differences could be due to confounding variables, like
   parental or territory quality, rather than to helping behaviour,
   2, One method of testing whether helping increases reproductive success
   is to compare the success of intact groups with those from which helpers
   have been removed. The disadvantage is that variables other than
   provisioning by, helpers (e,g. group size) are affected, which
   themselves could affect reproductive success. Alternatively, one can
   attempt to control statistically for confounding variables, but this is
   difficult in territorial species because it may be impossible to ensure
   that all confounding variables are measured.
   3. We took advantage of natural variability in provisioning behaviour
   among subordinate white-browed scrubwrens. Sericornis frontalis, to
   assess the effect of helping. Scrubwrens are a small passerine in the
   family Pardalotidae in which male offspring may remain on the natal
   territory; as adults, We compared the reproductive performance of pairs,
   groups with nonhelping subordinates and groups with helping
   subordinates, using data from 4-years' study of an individually
   colour-handed population resident in the Australian National Botanic
   Gardens, Canberra,
   4, The total rate of feeds to nestlings vc as greater when helpers were
   present, but we could detect no increase in nestling weight.
   Furthermore. we found no effect of helping behaviour on reproductive
   performance or reproductive success. Our measures included: (i) duration
   of the nesting cycle and interval between nesting attempts: (ii) success
   of individual nesting attempts, measured in over 20 ways: and (iii)
   reproductive success over the whole breeding season, measured as the
   total number of fledglings and independent young.
   5, There was also no effect of helping on survival of the female or
   dominant mole,
   6, We conclude that helping behaviour does not have a substantial,
   consistent effect on reproductive success. but cannot eliminate the
   possibility that it might increase reproductive success by a small
   amount or in some territories or years. Alternatively, helping behaviour
   might be the nonadaptive consequence of gene flow from populations in
   which it is adaptive, Nonetheless, we reject Jamieson's hypothesis that
   helping behaviour is a nonselected consequence of strong selection on
   parental behaviour, because, unlike many other species, helping is not
   an invariant consequence of natal philopatry.},

Title = {Comparison of 32 cover crops in an organic vineyard on the north coast
   of California},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE \& HORTICULTURE},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-81},
Abstract = {In a replicated study conducted from 1990 to 1992, cover crops and a
   control (resident vegetation) were evaluated in an organic wine-grape
   vineyard (cv. `Chardonnay'), located at a valley floor site in Hopland,
   Mendocino County, California. The purpose was to assess plant phenology,
   stature, biomass production, competitiveness with resident vegetation,
   and second-year stand regeneration or persistence in an untilled
   vineyard. Legumes (Fabaceae) evaluated included nine annual and two
   perennial types of clover (Trifolium spp.), bell bean and three other
   types of Vicia, two types of cool-season annual medic (Medicago spp.),
   field pea (Pisum sativum ssp. arvense), a mixture of biennial
   sweetclovers (Melilotus alba and M. officinalis), broadleaf birdsfoot
   trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). There were six types of cool-season annual
   grasses (Poaceae) including three cereal grains. Native Californian
   perennial grasses included one rhizomatous and five bunch types. The
   sole representative of Brassicaceae was black mustard (Brassica nigra).
   Unseeded, resident vegetation plots served as a control.
   In the first year after seeding, all cover crops except purple
   needlegrass (Nassella pulchra) established stands. Observations of
   phenological state suggested particularly advanced seed maturity by
   early May for the annual grasses barley, rattail fescue, soft chess, and
   cereal rye, as well as for burr medic and `Dalkeith' subterranean
   clover. By contrast, `Austrian Winter' field pea. berseem clover,
   biennial sweetclovers, and perennial legumes had not begun flowering.
   Other entries were at various stages of flowering. Height was generally
   greatest for black mustard followed by annual grasses, perennial
   grasses, vetches, field pea, and was similar for annual clovers and
   medics. Eighteen cover-crop regimes produced vegetational cover in
   excess of 90\%. Particularly great percentages of vegetational cover
   were obtained for control (resident vegetation), common vetch (Vicia
   sativa), annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), oat (Avena sativa), and
   berseem clover(Trifolium alexandrinum), Particularly small percentages
   of vegetational cover by cover crops occurred (in increasing order) for
   creeping red fescue (Festuca, rubra cv. `Molate'), broadleaf birdsfoot
   trefoil, and biennial sweetclovers. Particularly great biomass estimates
   were obtained (in decreasing order) for barley (Hordeum vulgare), oat,
   black mustard, purple vetch (Vicia beghalensis), rye, `Koala'
   subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum ssp. brachycalycinum) soft
   chess (Bromus hordeacens), woollypod vetch (Vicia villosa ssp.
   dasycarpa), and common vetch (Vicia sativa). Especially low biomass
   production was observed (in increasing order) for creeping red fescue
   (Festuca, rubra), biennial sweetclovers, strawberry clover, meadow
   barley, and the mix of ladino and strawberry clovers. Biomass for
   resident vegetation in the control plots was significantly greater than
   biomass produced by creeping red fescue.
   In the second May following seeding, cover crop stands were inspected
   visually and regeneration scored qualitatively and subjectively as none,
   very poor, poor. fair, good, and very good. Percentage of vegetational
   cover by crops was also assessed visually. Stands scored as having good
   or very good regeneration were assessed for biomass as in 1991. The
   following entries attained good or very good regeneration: soft chess,
   California brome, annual ryegrass, both forms of blue wildrye, oat,
   cereal rye, crimson clover, four varieties of subterranean clover, and
   both the mixture of ladino and strawberry clovers and the sole seeding
   of strawberry clover. Particularly great biomass values were obtained
   for crimson clover and for `Mt. Barker' and `Trikkala' subterranean
   clovers. None of the three vetches attained high percentages of cover in
   the second year; these are thought to benefit from tillage, which was
   not used in this study. Biomass readings were, for the most part, lower
   than in 1991. This may have been due to low soil moisture during autumn
   as a result of a lack of irrigation and rain.},

Abstract = {An `'eye-spotted'' beach ball and a commercially available deterrent
   eye-spot ball significantly reduced the number of house sparrows (Passer

   decreased with distance from the table, and was neglible at c. 40 m.
   Deterrence was increased 10\% by illuminating the eyes with a rotating
   halogen light and by reinforcing the visual stimulus with alarm calls of
   blackbirds (Turdus merula), house sparrows, and starlings (Sturnus
   vulgaris), but declined with continuous use, and disappeared altogether
   after 9 days. Eye-spot beach balls in a vineyard significantly reduced
   landings by song thrushes (Turdus philomelos) for 2 weeks, and landings
   by blackbirds, house sparrows, and starlings for 3 weeks. They failed,
   however, in the fourth week when the grapes were fully ripe and most in

Abstract = {The spatial distribution of gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), egg
   masses was determined in 60 developed lots in a residential community in
   Greenbelt, Md. The community was divided into low and high gypsy moth
   density sections, with average densities of 393.3 and 2,656.3 egg masses
   per ha, respectively. In the high-density lots, the proportion of egg
   masses found on trees, man made objects, and houses was 73.9, 21.6, and
   4.5\%, respectively. The distribution in the low density lots was
   similar. Oaks, Quercus spp., received the highest proportion of egg
   masses out of all tree species subcategories at both low and high
   population densities. The cost effectiveness of a number of potential
   sampling units, including entire lots, back yards, fixed area plots, and
   individual trees, was evaluated. The entire lot sampling units required
   the fewest samples to achieve a predetermined level of precision.
   However, cost (= sampling time) for these sampling units was also the
   highest, resulting in relatively low cost effectiveness. Fixed-area plot
   samples (0.01 ha) were in general the most cost effective sampling
   units. A binomial (presence-absence) sampling approach, in which the
   percentage of trees in each lot with >5 egg masses is determined, was
   nearly as cost effective as fixed-area plots, but its usefulness is
   limited because it does not provide direct estimates of absolute gypsy

Abstract = {Although frequently reported from within the Brisbane city boundaries,
   the range of the Australian brush-turkey, Alectura lathami, was limited

   1970s, however, the species' presence in the suburbs has increased

   led to a significant conflict with householders.  This study found the
   species to be most abundant in suburbs adjacent to forest reserves and
   major watercourses.  A number of extremely isolated populations were
   also identified.  Although suburban mounds contained similar numbers of
   eggs as mounds from the wild, suburban mounds were more prone to
   failure, probably due to the use of inappropriate mound materials. 
   Despite some evidence of increasing spread within the suburbs, the
   long-term survival of the species is seriously threatened by hatchling

Abstract = {(1) We studied differences in habitat distribution, local survival and
   mating success between the two morphs (resident/migrant) of the
   partially migratory European robin near Antwerp (Belgium). (2) Mean
   local survival of resident males (50\%) was higher than local survival
   of migrant males (17\%). During cold winters survival of residents
   decreased with about 50\%. (3) Mating sucess decreased with setting date
   from 74\% for early settling residents, over 44\% for migrants to 19\%
   for late-settling birds of unknown status. (4) The probability of
   breeding is two to four times higher in residents than in migrants. (5)
   Resident and migratory robins were habitat separated both in the
   breeding season and in winter: 70\% of breeding males were migratory in
   the woodland, but in the park and gardens most males were resident.
   Almost all females were migratory. (6) Unbalanced reproductive success
   of the resident and migratory morphs and arguments for conditionality
   show that partial migration in the European robin is a conditional
   strategy in which the migrants are making the best of a bad job. (7) We
   explain why our conclusions do not contradict experimental evidence for
   a strong genetic influence on migratory tendencies in the European
   robin.},

Abstract = {Habitat use and foraging behaviour of resident merlins (Falco
   columbarius) wintering in Saskatoon, Canada, were studied over a
   five-year period. Birds were trapped through the winter and selected
   individuals fitted with radio transmitters to monitor continuously their
   location, movements and activities from roost departure until re-entry.
   Merlins maintained individual home ranges in winter, with extensive
   overlap between neighbouring birds in some cases. Yearling home ranges
   were not  significantly different in size from those of adults. The
   winter home ranges of adults were closely associated with their previous
   nest site. Both adults and yearlings made significantly greater use of
   Residential habitat in the city than expected based on the area
   available in their home ranges. However, while adults remained largely
   in the two oldest habitat types, yearlings were also found in more
   recently built areas of the city. Home ranges held within the city were
   sometimes combined with foraging areas in the adjacent countryside. The
   use of foraging areas in farmyards and cattle feedlots outside of the
   city was most notable in adults, although some yearlings apparently
   learned this strategy in their first year. Merlins also used
   Commercial-Industrial habitat for hunting at levels much higher than
   expected from its availability in their home ranges. Diets in summer and
   winter had a high degree of overlap; house sparrows (Passer domesticus)
   and bohemian waxwings  (Bombycilla garrulus) made up a large proportion
   of the diet during both seasons. Hunting activity peaked at 09:00 and
   16:00 h, reflecting the replenishment of energy stores lost over-night,
   and the storage of energy in preparation for the next over-night fast.},

Abstract = {Composition and seasonal dynamics of both breeding and nonbreeding bird
   communities in five mountain villages near Innsbruck, Tyrol, were
   compared. To gain detailed information about the influence of village
   structure on bird life, the village areas were subdivided into five
   zones: 1) farmhouse dominated village parts (BD), 2) older residential
   areas (AB), 3) residential areas with newer buildings (NB), 4) areas
   with predominantly unfinished buildings and undeveloped ground (RB), 5)
   industrial and commercial zone (GB). According to differences in
   vegetation cover, food supply and microclimatic conditions in winter,
   the diversity of bird life showed remarkable differences between these
   zones throughout the year. With regard to breeding species the
   traditional farmhouse centers with their adjoining orchards proved the
   richest areas, showing balanced dominance structures and high species
   diversity. These areas were so highly populated in late autumn, but
   showed lows bird densities in  the winter months. On the other hand the
   highest average species numbers and the greatest abundance of birds were
   reached during the post breeding season (especially in winter) in the
   AB-areas with rich shrub and tree layers. The more recent residential
   and commercial stripes at the village edges with their uniform garden
   structures and sealed surfaces were characterized by low species
   diversities and high dominances of only few common species throughout
   the year.},

Abstract = {The Garden Warbler is a temperate-zone breeding bird that winters in
   tropical and southern Africa. To study the effects of internal timing
   processes and of photoperiodic conditions on the seasonal activities
   occurring before and after the breeding season, Garden Warblers were
   exposed from late September to late May to photoperiodic conditions
   experienced by free-living conspecifics wintering at the northern or the
   southern edge of the wintering area; i.e. the equator or 20.degree.S.
   Changes in body weight, migratory restlessness and gonadal size as well
   as the occurrence of molt were investigated. The birds exposed to a
   constant equatorial photoperiod carried out a complete prenuptial molt
   after autumn migratory restlessness. Subsequently gonadal development
   and spring migratory restlessness were initiated. These results indicate
   that photoperiodic changes are not necessarily required for the direct
   control of these activities. Photoperiodic conditions do, however,
   affect the timing of these processes. This was indicated by the
   performance of the warblers exposed to the 20.degree.S photoperiodic
   simulation under which most of the events investigated occurred earlier
   than in the birds held in the equatorial photoperiodic simulation. The
   acceleration was not sufficient, however to allow a full reproductive
   cycle during the southern hemisphere summer. In general, the results
   indicate that these long-distance migrants differ from all-year-round
   temperate-zone residents with regard to  both the significance of
   endogenous timing factors and the photoperiodic conditions under which
   refractoriness can be terminated.},

Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {1985},
Volume = {20},

Pages = {569-592},
Abstract = {Biological and sedimentological samples were obtained in June 1980 from
   box cores taken in 100-200 m of water on sandy-mud sediments near the
   East and West Flower Garden Bank {[}FGB] reefs, on the Texas-Louisiana
   Continental Shelf {[}USA]. The objective was to obtain baseline
   information about sedimentary parameters and organisms adjacent to the
   FGB environments in order to allow inferences to be made about potential
   effects of physical disturbance of the seafloor on the resident benthos.
   Most infaunal organisms are found in the upper 3-5 cm of the bottom.
   Permanent meiofauna dominate in both numbers and biomass. X-radiographs
   of sediment fabrics show all stations to be reworked by head-down
   deposit-feeders or errant bioturbators. Taxa responsible for this
   bioturbation were not quantitatively sampled. Macrofaunal densities
   range from 3000-25,000 m-2 and total meiofauna from 221-892 .times. (10
   cm-2). Nematodes dominate followed in equal abundance by foraminiferans,
   polychaetes, and copepods. Of the total sediment ATP in the top 3 cm
   75\% is contributed by meiofauna. These benthic assemblages are
   hypothesized to represent a mixture of pioneering and high-order
   successional stages. Bacterial abundances are positively correlated with
   organic content and inversely correlated with macro- and meiofaunal
   densities. This inverse relationship may reflect consumer cropping
   intensities. Both microbial ATP and bacterial biomass are lower than
   reported for the Georgia Bight Shelf, Cape Blanc, West African Shelf,
   western coast of Norway, and Long Island Sound. Bacterial counts are
   lower than those recorded for the East China Sea and the Amazon River
   shelf. Moderate to low standing stocks of benthos, dominated by
   meiofaunal-sized taxa, further suggest that this area of the Gulf of
   Mexico is a relatively oligotrophic system for infaunal benthic
   consumers. Higher order successional stages are, in general, adversely
   affected to a greater extent than pioneering stages by  physical
   disturbance. In the Texas-Louisiana shelf region, dilution of an already
   food limited system by inert barium sulfate would be expected to result
   in even lower standing stocks of benthic infaunal invertebrates.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {1983},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The number of birds found in 37 (5 ha) sites on farmland in
   Cambridgeshire {[}England, UK] were counted 12 times in the winter of
   1980-1981 and again in the summer of 1981. The sites represented 10
   types of habitat and were chosen to give a range from arable land
   without ditches, hedges and trees, to arable and grassland with up to
   200 m ditch and/or hedge of various sizes; and at the extreme, linear
   strips of woodland. Each of the structural components influenced the
   number of species using a site. In winter, the average number of species
   per site increased from 5 on arable land to 7.5 when a ditch was
   present; numbers increased with the additional presence of short hedges
   or trees to 12 spp. With tall hedges the number was 17 and with a narrow
   strip of woodland 19. The number of resident thrushes, buntings, and
   robin + wren, and dunnock were all significantly different in different
   types of habitat. The basic pattern was the same in summer, with high
   correlations between species number in winter and summer. Regression
   analysis was used to relate numbers of species, number of contacts with
   birds of a species and number of territories to measured characteristics
   of te sites, i.e., length, depth, volume and cover in ditches; length,
   height, width and cover in hedges; number of shrub and herb species in
   hedges and ditches. Additional variables used were the length of
   hedgerow, and areas of woodland and garden both in the 1 km2 and in the
   2.5 km2 of countryside surrounding the quadrat. In winter the nature of
   the surrounding 2.5 km2 significantly influenced numbers of most groups
   of species, but accounted for little (< 30\%) of the variation in
   numbers. In the sites with hedges different characteristics were
   important for different species. Thus, numbers of resident thrushes,
   wrens and robins increased with increased ditch volume. Hedge height was
   not important for these species but was important for tits. More of the
   variation in numbers of a species present in summer was accounted for by
   both characteristics of the surrounding countryside, and the ditches and
   hedges themselves than was the case in winter. As in winter different
   variables were important for different species, but some were of
   importance to several species. The number of species seen in sites with
   hedges and, of these the number holding territories, decreased with
   increased area of gardens in the surrounding countryside but increased
   with increasing hedge height and hedge cover in the site. The management
   of hedges and ditches to enhance their use by birds is discussed.},

Title = {BIRD-LIFE ON A NORFOLK FARM IN RELATION TO AGRICULTURAL CHANGES},
Journal = {BIRD STUDY},
Year = {1976},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {163-182},
Abstract = {The breeding bird community of Church Farm, Cranworth, Norfolk
   {[}England] was studied during 1965-68 and 1971-74, on either side of a
   period in which improvements to the farm were carried out, including the
   removal of 1/3 of the internal hedgerow system to enlarge the fields.
   The scale of the resulting changes in the bird community is assessed by
   comparing the actual census figures with the results predicted on the
   basis of the national index provided by the BTO {[}British Trust for
   Ornithology] Common Birds Census {[}CBC] enquiry. The field species
   (mallard, grey and red-legged partridges, lapwing, skylark) showed a
   population growth in excess of that predicted, probably largely a
   response to the greater field size and cropping changes. Some hedgerow
   species, including hole-nesting birds, showed declines, especially wren
   38\%, blackbird 25\%, dunnock 20\% and song thrush 19\%. Resident
   seed-eaters appear to have been but little affected. The whitethroat and
   some other summer visitors show a reduction below the level predicted by
   the CBC index. The farmland habitat is suboptimal for many species and
   seldom, if ever, achieves its full carrying capacity; census studies
   suggest that the normal level of exploitation is around 75\%-80\% of the
   potential maximum. The differential performance of a number of hedgerow
   breeders following the farm changes may be due to the extent to which
   available niches were occupied during the earlier period. Hedgerows
   should be regarded as an integral part of the mosaic farmland habitat,
   linking the remnant woods, pools, pits, gardens and other centers of
   avian dispersal. A loss of hedgerows of the order experienced at Church
   Farm (about 30\% of the total length) and other farm improvements,
   definitely brought about a change in the bird-community structure, but
   did not lead to serious impoverishment of the bird-life.},
