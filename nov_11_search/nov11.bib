Title = {Why garden for wildlife? Social and ecological drivers, motivations and
   barriers for biodiversity management in residential landscapes},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {86},

Abstract = {Residential landscapes with private gardens are major land covers in
   cities and their sustainable management is paramount for achieving a
   resilient urban future. Here we focus on the value of residential
   ecosystems for biodiversity conservation and explore the social and
   ecological factors that influence wildlife-friendly garden management.
   Using a stratified sampling design across the UK city of Leeds, this
   interdisciplinary study develops and applies a mixed method approach,
   including questionnaires, interviews and ecological surveys across
   multiple spatial scales. We quantify wildlife-friendly gardening using
   two measures: (i) the number of wildlife-friendly features within
   gardens (the wildlife resources index, WRI); and (ii) the frequency of
   winter bird feeding. Wildlife-friendly gardening is influenced by a
   combination of garden characteristics and management intensity,
   householder demographics, wider environmental activity and landscape
   context. Residents reveal a range of motivations for wildlife-friendly
   gardening, notably personal well-being and a moral responsibility to
   nature. Respondents expressed a duty to maintain neighbourhood
   standards, revealing that social norms are a considerable barrier to
   uptake of wildlife-friendly activities, but also provide an opportunity
   where neighbour mimicry results in diffusion of wildlife-friendly
   practices. Community-driven initiatives that engage, educate and empower
   residents are better placed to encourage wildlife-friendly gardening
   than top-down financial incentives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Private gardens comprise a large component of greenspace in cities and
   can offer substantial conservation opportunities. There has been strong
   advocacy from researchers, policymakers, and conservation practitioners
   to engage householders in wildlife-friendly gardening practices to
   increase the quantity, quality and connection of habitat resources for
   urban wildlife. Despite this call to action, there remains limited
   knowledge on the use and benefit of some wildlife-friendly structures
   within gardens, such as artificial refuges and water sources. In
   collaboration with 131 citizen scientists in southwestern Australia, we
   examined the use of seven wildlife-friendly structure types by four
   vertebrate taxa groups. Following 2841 wildlife surveys undertaken
   between 31 July 2022 and 22 February 2023, we found that all structures
   were used primarily by target taxa, water sources were often used by
   relatively common species, certain structures such as possum shelters
   were used by rare and threatened species (e.g. western ringtail possum),
   and that there was evidence of animals making use of the
   wildlife-friendly structures for reproduction (e.g. bird eggs in nest
   boxes and tadpoles in water sources). Water sources were used more
   frequently and by a greater diversity of wildlife than artificial
   refuges. In particular, bird baths were used by the highest number of
   species (mainly birds) while ponds were used by the greatest variety of
   taxa (birds, reptiles, frogs, mammals). Our findings provide
   evidence-based support for the advocacy of wildlife-friendly gardening
   practices and further highlight the role of residential gardens for
   biodiversity conservation.},

Title = {Formative audience research to increase consumer demand for professional
   wildlife-friendly landscape maintenance},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {90},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Greenspace in residential landscapes meets human needs, connects people
   with nature, and supports wildlife and biodiversity. However, some
   landscape maintenance practices are detrimental to wildlife and
   components of their habitat. We conducted a cross-sectional study to
   understand consumer knowledge, the extent of existing demand, and
   barriers related to wildlife-friendly landscape maintenance practices.
   An electronic survey was employed to collect data among Florida
   residents who were at least 18 years old and had a lawn or landscape for
   which they made decisions regarding maintenance. Non-probability opt-in
   sampling was used to recruit participants. Altogether 2101 residents
   completed the survey, among which 1053 indicated they hired green
   industry professionals for some aspects of landscape maintenance.
   Residents were least knowledgeable (M +/- S.D. = 2.82 +/- 1.17) about
   when to apply products like pesticides to yard/planting areas to
   minimize harm to wildlife whereas they were most knowledgeable (M +/-
   S.D. = 3.32 +/- 1.16) about how to read pesticide labels when measured
   on a five-point Likert-type scale. The frequency of demand for 56
   wildlife-friendly landscape maintenance practices varied from most of
   the time to half of the time on a five-point Likert-type scale.
   Consumers agreed homeowner association restrictions, lack of knowledge,
   lack of awareness, lack of labeling on plants, and associated costs were
   some major barriers to their engagement in wildlife-friendly
   landscaping. It is recommended to work on reducing these perceived
   barriers among residents and increasing rewards with interventions like
   education, pledges, and financial incentives among others to increase
   demand for landscape maintenance services that support wildlife.},

Title = {Evolving systems of pro-environmental behavior among wildscape gardeners},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Cities are important sites for encouraging more widespread adoption of
   pro-environmental behaviors (PEB) that benefit humans and wildlife
   alike. Wildscaping, a type of stewardship PEB in which people create
   wildlife friendly gardens, has been promoted by conservation
   organizations, yet fundamental questions remain about what wildscaping
   entails and what factors contribute to sustained involvement. We used a
   social-ecological systems (SES) framework to examine behavior change
   among urban residents in Colorado who had received wildscape gardening
   certification and training. We employed semi-structured interviews (n =
   11), quantitative surveys (n = 63), participant observation, and
   document analysis, and analyzed data using grounded theoretical
   techniques. We found that program participants engaged in 14 gardening
   behaviors targeting habitat creation on their properties, and 11
   advocacy behaviors targeting social change. These behaviors were driven
   by 10 interconnected motivations, including mutual refuge with wildlife,
   changing norms, aesthetic beauty, and sense of place. Engagement in
   wildscaping was sustained over time by multi-scalar contextual factors,
   including social interactions and formal program participation. These
   findings offer the first SES understanding of how urban residents begin
   and expand their engagement in wildscape gardening and advocacy. Future
   research should focus on how understanding of SES characteristics can
   enable more effective behavior change programs in urban landscapes.
   Possible ways that conservation outreach could consider SES include
   encouraging evolving feedback loops between participants' motivations
   and behaviors, emphasizing reciprocal benefits to individuals and their
   social-ecological context, and promoting coordinated involvement by
   different types of actors at multiple scales of the system.},

   species richness in urban and arable landscapes},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {929},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Insect declines are being reported worldwide and private, residential
   gardens could provide refugia for these species under increasing land
   use change. Interest in wildlife-friendly gardening has increased, but
   many management recommendations lack a scientific evidence-base. We used
   a large citizen science scheme, the Garden Butterfly Survey (GBS), with
   data from over 600 gardens across Great Britain (2016 - 2021) to
   determine how the surrounding landscape influences the abundance and
   species richness of butterflies in gardens and whether wildlife-friendly
   gardening practices, such as having long grass and providing nectar
   plants, benefit butterflies. First, we show that GBS provides reliable
   estimates of species abundances by comparing with results from
   standardised, long-term monitoring data. Garden size and surrounding
   land use had significant effects on butterfly abundance and richness in
   gardens, including positive relationships with garden size, woodland and
   arable farmland and negative relationships with urbanisation. Both the
   presence and area of long grass in gardens were positively related to
   higher butterfly richness and abundance, with the latter being driven by
   butterflies that use grasses as larval host plants. These effects
   differed depending on the surrounding landscape, such that long grass
   resulted in higher garden butterfly abundance in landscapes dominated by
   arable farming, and higher abundance and richness in highly urbanised
   areas. The presence of flowering ivy ( Hedera spp.) in gardens resulted
   in higher abundance of Celastrina argiolus holly blue which uses ivy as
   a larval host, and of Vanessa atalanta red admiral and Polygonia c
   -album comma, which favour it as a nectar source. Our work provides
   evidence that undertaking simple wildlife-friendly garden practices can
   be beneficial for attracting butterflies, particularly in heavily
   modified areas. With over 728,000 ha of gardens in Great Britain, the
   cumulative effect of leaving areas of lawn uncut and providing nectar
   and larval host plants could be key for helping biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Residential yards comprise a substantial portion of urban landscapes,

   percentage of yards with trees and plants with fruits or berries were
   positively associated with native bird species richness, whereas the
   number of outdoor cats had a negative association. The number of
   birdfeeders was not an important predictor for native species richness.
   We also found that migratory birds were observed on transects with more

Abstract = {Activities undertaken by householders in their gardens have huge
   potential to enhance city-wide biodiversity, but programs aimed at
   activating householders require an understanding of the factors
   encouraging or acting as barriers to the uptake of different kinds of
   activities. We provided 42 householders with two species-enhancing
   activities, selected from six possibilities, free-of-charge (to remove
   the barrier of initial cost). We collected socio-demographic data as
   well as information on knowledge of common urban species,
   pro-environmental behaviors and nature connectedness. We monitored
   ongoing engagement at two time points: 1 and 6 months. Characteristics
   of householders opting for different activities varied in terms of their
   degree of environmental engagement, their knowledge about common
   species, and the size of their gardens; e.g., bird feeders and bee
   planters were popular with people who did not know the names of common
   species and were not particularly engaged in pro-environmental
   activities respectively, whereas lizard habitat creation was attractive
   to people who were already engaged in wildlife gardening activities.
   Cost to continue with activities was a significant barrier for some
   people, but most householders were willing to practice relatively
   inexpensive activities in small spaces. Esthetics was an important
   factor to be considered when enhancing invertebrate habitat (e.g., bug
   hotels are more attractive than log piles, and planters for bees contain
   colorful flowers). A commonly cited barrier was lack of information
   about wildlife-friendly activities, despite much being available online.
   Most participants (85\%) talked about their activities with others,
   potentially acting as influencers and shifting social norms.},

Title = {Closing the Gap: Communicating to Change Gardening Practices in Support

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Private gardens collectively comprise the largest green space in most
   cities and the greatest potential for increasing the extent of
   wildlife-friendly and native-dominated habitat, improving the quality of
   ecosystem services, and providing opportunities for urban dwellers to
   reconnect with nature. Because attitudes and values driving landscape
   preferences in gardens are complex and often not conducive to
   biodiversity, and a gap exists between the possession of knowledge or
   values and the expression of pro-environmental behavior, facilitating
   change in gardening behavior is challenging. We attempted to improve
   knowledge and influence values, attitudes, and gardening behavior of 55
   householders in favor of native biodiversity and environmentally
   friendly practices, through a two-way communication process, or
   interactive dialog, during a process of biodiversity documentation of
   their gardens. Informative feedback on their garden with a normative
   component was also provided. Despite being well educated and
   knowledgeable about common species at the start of the study, an
   increase in knowledge and shift in attitude was detected in 64\% of
   householders: 40\% reported a greater understanding of wildlife, and
   26\% made changes in their gardens, 13\% to support native biodiversity.
   The normative component of our feedback information was of particular
   interest to 20\% of householders. Because neighborhood norms influence
   gardening practices, changes adopted by a proportion of householders
   should be perpetuated across neighborhoods. The process of biodiversity
   assessment, dialog, and feedback was effective in improving knowledge of
   wildlife and native species, and stimulated a shift in attitude that
   resulted in native-friendly gardening practices. These changes were
   detected primarily through open self-report questions, rather than
   quantitative measures.},

Title = {An assessment of a conservation strategy to increase garden connectivity

   barrier too far?},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Urban areas are associated with high levels of habitat fragmentation.
   For some terrestrial species with limited climbing abilities, property
   boundaries can pose a significant problem by limiting access to
   residential gardens. The West European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus)
   has declined markedly in the UK but is commonly found in areas of human
   habitation, including residential gardens. `Hedgehog Street' is a public
   engagement campaign aimed at recruiting volunteers ('Hedgehog
   Champions') to create access points ('hedgehog highways') across garden
   boundaries to improve habitat connectivity. In this study, we used a
   series of questionnaire surveys to explore motivations for and obstacles
   to the creation of highways. Householders were more likely to have
   created a highway if they were already aware of the Hedgehog Street
   campaign, if their garden contained a high number of wildlife-friendly
   features and if they considered watching wildlife to be important.
   Hedgehog Champions created, on average, 1.69 highways each with 52.0\%
   creating none; this would equate to an estimated >120,000 across all
   registered Champions. In comparison, 6.1-29.8\% of non-Champions stated
   that they had made a highway. However, most highways had been created in
   boundaries that could already be traversed via naturally occurring
   holes: only 11.4\% of garden boundaries could be traversed, and 3.2\% of
   gardens accessed, just via a hedgehog highway. In addition, only 5.0\%
   of gardens were considered totally inaccessible to hedgehogs. The most
   common reasons cited for not having made a highway were that
   householders' gardens were already accessible to hedgehogs followed by
   concerns relating to boundary ownership and / or communicating with
   neighbours. Future studies need to identify strategies for overcoming
   these obstacles to maximize citizen engagement, particularly with those
   householders who are not innately ``wildlife-friendly{''}, and to
   quantify the degree to which networks of highways affect patterns of
   individual movement and, ultimately, populations.},

Title = {Wildlife gardening initiates a feedback loop to reverse the ``extinction
   of experience{''}},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {289},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Urbanization can cause the ``extinction of experience{''}, a feedback
   loop in which people who have little interaction with nature are less
   likely to protect it. This cycle could result in a continual erosion of
   biodiversity and fewer opportunities for people to experience nature.
   Alternatively, a sustainable version of this loop may occur which
   incorporates environmental engagement, or ``noticing nature.{''} Here we
   combine ecological and social data to provide the first empirical test
   of the full extinction of experience/noticing nature loop, using birds
   as a focal taxon. Our study included 815 urban residents from 25
   neighborhoods near Chicago, IL (USA). Residents were asked about their
   yard management and perceptions of birds in their neighborhoods. A
   researcher also documented the neighborhood bird communities. The social
   and ecological data were incorporated into a structural equation model
   to test the existence of a feedback loop. Our data confirm the existence
   of a loop but indicate that the relationship between people and birds is
   indirect rather than direct, suggesting that biodiversity changes are
   less important in the loop than residents' impressions of biodiversity.
   This is promising for urban conservation, because it suggests the cycle
   may continue even when the scale of management in an individual yard
   does not match the scale necessary for an immediate impact on wildlife.
   We therefore suggest that small wildlife-friendly changes to residential
   yards, in the aggregate, have the potential to reverse the extinction of
   experience and promote long-term increases in biodiversity.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Wildlife are increasingly being found in urban habitats, and likely rely
   on some resources in suburban household yards, which exposes them to the
   effects of yard management and human and pet activities. We compared the
   relationships between these potential disturbances and benefits to the
   number of different types of wildlife sighted by householders, using
   written surveys. Owing to the inability of many household respondents to
   identify animals to the species or genus level, each different `type' of
   animal individually listed was counted to generate the total number of
   types of wildlife observed by each household. We found that relatively
   more types of wildlife were observed by residents whose yards provided
   ease of faunal access under or through fences, had reduced pesticide
   use, increased levels of anthropogenic noise, and increased presence of
   pets in yards. The latter two associations likely relate to the
   increased opportunities to observe wildlife in yards that each creates.
   We also investigated the use of yards by wildlife and domestic pets in
   open compared to more vegetated habitats by day and night, using
   motion-sensor cameras. All animals observed were compared to the
   activity of introduced brown and black rats (Rattus norvegicus, R.
   rattus), owing to their wild origins but long commensal history with
   humans. Camera images indicated that animals' natural activity periods
   were maintained in yards. Brown antechinuses (Antechinus stuartii),
   northern brown bandicoots (Isoodon macrourus), domestic cats (Felis
   catus) and native birds (species as listed below) each preferred
   sheltered or vegetated habitats over open habitats, when compared to the
   introduced rats that showed little habitat preference. However, unlike
   the other species, the native birds used open areas more than vegetated
   or sheltered areas when compared within their group only. The common
   brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) was observed to use open areas
   comparatively more than the introduced rats, but used vegetated or
   sheltered habitats more when compared to self only. The domestic dog
   (Canis familiaris) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) used open areas more than
   vegetated or sheltered areas, when compared to the introduced rats, and
   against themselves. This indicated a level of coping with urban
   stressors by the native animals, but with a reliance on more vegetated
   habitats to allow for natural stress-relieving behaviours of escape or
   hiding. Here, we offer insights into how each of these findings may be
   used to help educate and motivate increased household responsibility for
   urban wildlife conservation.},

Title = {Multi-Scalar Drivers of Residential Vegetation Changes in Metropolitan
   Phoenix, Arizona},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 21},
Abstract = {In the arid southwestern U.S., urban greening strategies have been
   promoted to alleviate ecosystem disservices associated with lawns,
   including the adoption of xeric yards with desert-adapted floras and
   gravel groundcover and wildlife-friendly yards with complex vegetation
   structure and composition. Scant studies have investigated the extent of
   different vegetation changes in urban greening practices and the
   complexity of associated human drivers. We addressed this gap by
   analyzing survey data from two survey periods (2017 and 2021) to answer
   the following questions: to what extent have residents from metropolitan
   Phoenix made different vegetation changes in their yards over the last
   decade, and how do multi-scalar human drivers affect different
   vegetation changes? We found a sustainable trajectory for residential
   vegetation changes in Phoenix since mid-2010s, with declining additions
   of grass and increases in trees and desert plants across residential
   neighborhoods. Esthetics was an influential driver of both tree planting
   and native gardening. Additionally, tree planting was associated with
   anthropocentric values (i.e., low-maintenance needs), while desert plant
   additions reflected the appreciation of nature (i.e., attitudes towards
   the desert) and environmental concerns (i.e., supporting wildlife).
   Institutions such as local government programs might shape residents'
   vegetation choices, as tree planting differed among municipalities. We
   also found counterintuitive influences of residential tenure controls on
   landscaping decisions. Specifically, renters were more likely to add
   yard trees compared to homeowners. Our results inform landscape
   sustainability by identifying potential pathways to residential yard
   changes that offer a multitude of services while being appreciated and
   maintained by residents.},

   conservation and highly valued under COVID lockdown},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {226},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urbanization is increasing globally, with concomitant negative effects
   on biodiversity and human well-being. In urban areas, gardens may
   contribute to overall green space, bringing benefits to wildlife and
   residents. We used a community science approach to gather data and
   understand the role of urban gardens for wildlife and for residents in a
   developing country, where information on the subject is scarce. We
   evaluated how local characteristics and landscape quality influenced the
   presence of three native birds and two insect species as indicators of
   habitat conservation value, in a town immersed in an Argentinean
   National Park. We also estimated gardens' value during COVID-19
   quarantine to assess whether owners appreciated them more when outdoor
   activities were not allowed, increasing awareness of the value of nature
   for well-being. We found that most respondents enjoy birdwatching in
   their gardens and consider birds as beneficial; however, the pleasure of
   observing insects is lower. The relevance of local garden
   characteristics differed according to the species in question,
   highlighting the importance of using different species as indicators to
   assess garden conservation value. The proportion of tree cover
   surrounding the gardens had a positive effect on the probability of
   finding birds and insects, while the proportion of built-up area had a
   negative effect. During COVID-19 lockdown, most respondents enjoyed
   their gardens equally or more than usual, and those that assigned a
   monetary value to gardens, chose the highest one. We encouraged
   initiatives that engage, inform and empower residents on
   wildlife-friendly gardening to favor the inclusion of gardens as part of
   wider conservation and urban planning strategies.},

Title = {Different social drivers, including perceptions of urban wildlife,
   explain the ecological resources in residential landscapes},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {401-413},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Context The conservation value of residential landscapes is becoming
   increasingly apparent in our urbanizing world. The ecological
   characteristics of residential areas are largely determined by the
   decisions of many individual ``managers.{''} In these complex
   socio-ecological systems, it is important to understand the factors that
   motivate human decision-making.
   Objectives Our first objective was to quantify wildlife resources and
   management activities in residential landscapes and compare vegetation
   in front and back yards. Our second objective was to test three
   hypotheses linked with variation in yards: socioeconomic
   characteristics, neighborhood design factors, and perceptions of
   neighborhood birds.
   Methods We conducted surveys of over 900 residents in 25 Chicago-area
   neighborhoods to examine the wildlife resources contained in front and
   back yards and the social factors associated with variation in yards. We
   used a multi-scalar approach to examine among-yard and
   among-neighborhood variation in residential landscapes.
   Results Results indicate that back yards contain more wildlife resources
   than front yards, including greater vegetation complexity, more plants
   with fruit/berries, and more plants intended to attract birds.
   Furthermore, different hypotheses explain variation in front and back
   yards. Perceptions of birds were most important in explaining variation
   in back yard vegetation and wildlife-friendly resources per parcel,
   while neighbors' yards and socioeconomic characteristics best explained
   front yard vegetation.
   Conclusions This study demonstrates the importance of back yards as an
   unexplored and underestimated resource for biodiversity. In addition,
   the results provide insight into the complex factors linked with yard
   decisions, notably that residents' connections with neighborhood birds
   appear to translate to on-the-ground actions.},

Abstract = {This qualitative study explores how urban gardeners were supported to

   A development phase follows where connections to place deepen;
   stewardship knowledge, competencies and activities strengthen; and
   commitment to stewardship increases through learning by doing, supported
   by rewarding results, validation, community involvement, and accessible

Title = {Woody cover does not promote activity of nest predators in residential
   yards},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {32-39},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Urban development often affects resource availability in ways that can
   influence not only community structure, but key species interactions
   that shape population dynamics. Although some resources are
   unintentionally altered, others are deliberately changed to improve
   habitat for urban wildlife, particularly songbirds. We hypothesized that
   management strategies that encourage planting trees and shrubs (i.e.
   increasing woody cover) would inadvertently attract predators of bird
   nests, which are generally abundant within cities. To test this, we
   examined the relationship between percent woody cover, pooled across
   trees and shrubs, and diurnal activity patterns of nest predators in
   residential yards. We surveyed predator activity and characterized
   habitat using aerial imagery of seven suburban neighborhoods in Franklin
   County, Ohio during April-August 2011 and 2012. Predator activity varied
   widely among individual yards, but contrary to our hypothesis, the
   availability of woody cover at either yard or neighborhood scales was
   not a strong predictor of diurnal activity in yards for five common
   species of nest predators (Eastern gray squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis;
   common grackle, Quiscalus quiscala; brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus
   ater; blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata; and domestic cat, Fells catus).
   Thus, our study suggests that wildlife habitat management or gardening
   programs that recommend increasing woody cover do not necessarily
   attract some common predators of songbird nests in Midwestern
   landscapes. Additional research that identifies which habitat features
   beyond woody cover best predict nest predator activity will facilitate
   the creation of management recommendations that increase the
   conservation value of urban environments for songbirds. (C) 2014

   community diversity across the continental USA},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urbanization has a homogenizing effect on biodiversity and leads to
   communities with fewer native species and lower conservation value.
   However, few studies have explored whether or how land management by
   urban residents can ameliorate the deleterious effects of this
   homogenization on species composition. We tested the effects of local
   (land management) and neighborhood-scale (impervious surface and tree
   canopy cover) features on breeding bird diversity in six US metropolitan
   areas that differ in regional species pools and climate. We used a
   Bayesian multiregion community model to assess differences in species
   richness, functional guild richness, community turnover, population
   vulnerability, and public interest in each bird community in six land
   management types: two natural area park types (separate and adjacent to
   residential areas), two yard types with conservation features
   (wildlife-certified and water conservation) and two lawn-dominated yard
   types (high- and low-fertilizer application), and surrounding
   neighborhood-scale features. Species richness was higher in yards
   compared with parks; however, parks supported communities with high
   conservation scores while yards supported species of high public
   interest. Bird communities in all land management types were composed of
   primarily native species. Within yard types, species richness was
   strongly and positively associated with neighborhood-scale tree canopy
   cover and negatively associated with impervious surface. At a
   continental scale, community turnover between cities was lowest in yards
   and highest in parks. Within cities, however, turnover was lowest in
   high-fertilizer yards and highest in wildlife-certified yards and parks.
   Our results demonstrate that, across regions, preserving natural areas,
   minimizing impervious surfaces and increasing tree canopy are essential
   strategies to conserve regionally important species. However, yards,
   especially those managed for wildlife support diverse, heterogeneous
   bird communities with high public interest and potential to support
   species of conservation concern. Management approaches that include the
   preservation of protected parks, encourage wildlife-friendly yards and
   acknowledge how public interest in local birds can advance successful
   conservation in American residential landscapes.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In sprawling metropolitan areas, residential landscaping is a major
   concern with respect to biodiversity conservation, and it could play a
   critical role in conserving wildlife habitat. In the United States,
   residential landscaping typically consists of maintained lawns with
   specimen plantings of non-native trees and shrubs; such designs provide
   poor habitat for urban wildlife species. We conducted a case study of
   Raleigh, North Carolina residents to determine how providing information
   about the benefits of native plant landscaping to bird species
   influenced urban residents' landscaping preferences. We used Wilcoxon
   Signed Rank tests to determine if respondent preferences for 0, 50, 75
   and 100 \% native plant landscaping coverages changed after residents
   were informed about the benefits that native plants provide for birds.
   Initially, the 50 \% native landscaping coverage was most preferred by
   residents; however, preferences for all four native plant landscaping
   coverage designs were significantly different after the informational
   treatment. Neutrality changed to opposition for the 0 \% native plant
   coverage, while opposition changed to support and neutrality for the 75
   and 100 \% native plant coverage designs, respectively. After the
   informational treatment, the 50 and 75 \% native plant landscaping
   coverage had the highest mean preference levels, although the 100 \%
   design was ranked first more than any other design. Our findings suggest
   that residential support for native plant landscaping is higher than is
   reflected by typical residential landscaping practices, and that
   dissemination of information regarding the benefits of native plant
   landscaping to birds could alter public preferences for native plant
   landscaping.},

Title = {The role of edible cities supporting sustainability transformation - A
   conceptual multi-dimensional framework tested on a case study in Germany},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {255},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Cities have become major contributors to sustainability problems and, in
   the meantime, seedbeds for sustainability transformation. Urban
   nature-based solutions, such as greening strategies that foster urban
   food production as a cross-cutting issue, promise to have
   multidimensional benefits for sustainable urban development. However, a
   conceptual understanding of interlinkages between nature-based solutions
   and their contribution to sustainability transformation is lacking. The
   goals of this study are twofold. First, to develop a conceptual model
   for testing multi-dimensional impacts of urban nature-based solutions
   supporting social-spatial, social-ecological and individual sustainable
   transformation. The model has been developed based on the concepts of
   place attachment, human-food connection and pro-environmental food
   behaviour. Second, the conceptual model is applied to the example of
   edible cities. Edible cities can be considered an innovative
   nature-based solution that provides multiple cobenefits by offering
   (free) food for urban residents in public spaces. A Principal Component
   Analysis of a survey among residents of Andernach (N = 380), one of the
   first edible cities in Germany revealed, in contrast to the conceptual
   three-dimensional model, a four-dimensional model with high construct
   validity and reliability. The model comprises a) place attachment, b)
   experiential and c) material human-food connection as well as d)
   pro-environmental food consumption. Items of internal emotional and
   philosophical human-food connection included within the
   pro-environmental food consumption scale suggested their important role
   in fostering sustainability. Results suggest that the edible city can be
   considered a strategy for increasing urban attractiveness and place
   identity, supporting social bonding and experiential human-food
   connection by using the edible areas for nature observation and
   recreation. However, although the residents are well informed about the
   edible city concept, most residents are not actively involved and rarely
   use the food provided by the edible city. Thus, they also could not
   answer questions related to cognitive human-food connection such as
   estimating the food's taste and health quality. To strengthen material
   and cognitive human-food connection, policy implications of the results
   propose the implementation of accompanying information and participation
   activities. By linking nature-based solutions with sustainability
   transformation, this study provides conceptual and practical
   implications for the multidimensional benefits of innovative urban
   greening strategies such as edible cities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Contradiction and Complacency Shape Attitudes towards the Toll of Roads
   on Wildlife},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary: Mitigating the toll of roads on wildlife can become
   difficult when awareness and exposure does not result in willingness to
   change driving behaviour. Using a self-reporting questionnaire, we found
   that while most drivers view wildlife vehicle collisions as a serious
   issue, increasing exposure to collisions decreased this attitude and it
   did not translate into willingness to adopt additional mitigation
   strategies. In addition, despite most respondents stating they routinely
   drive slower when collision risk is high (at dusk and dawn), our
   assessment of driving trends via traffic speeds suggested this sentiment
   was not generally adhered to. We suggest that competing priorities and
   complacency when risk to people is low may adversely affect willingness
   to prevent collisions.
   Abstract: Most people in the world now live in cities. Urbanisation
   simultaneously isolates people from nature and contributes to
   biodiversity decline. As cities expand, suburban development and the
   road infrastructure to support them widens their impact on wildlife.
   Even so, urban communities, especially those on the peri-urban fringe,
   endeavour to support biodiversity through wildlife friendly gardens,
   green spaces and corridors, and conservation estates. On one hand, many
   who live on city fringes do so because they enjoy proximity to nature,
   however, the ever increasing intrusion of roads leads to conflict with
   wildlife. Trauma (usually fatal) to wildlife and (usually emotional and
   financial) to people ensues. Exposure to this trauma, therefore, should
   inform attitudes towards wildlife vehicle collisions (WVC) and be linked
   to willingness to reduce risk of further WVC. While there is good
   anecdotal evidence for this response, competing priorities and better
   understanding of the likelihood of human injury or fatalities, as
   opposed to wildlife fatalities, may confound this trend. In this paper
   we sought to explore this relationship with a quantitative study of
   driver behaviour and attitudes to WVC from a cohort of residents and
   visitors who drive through a peri-urban reserve (Royal National Park) on
   the outskirts of Sydney, Australia. We distributed a self-reporting
   questionnaire and received responses from 105 local residents and 51
   visitors to small townships accessed by roads through the national park.
   We sought the respondents' exposure to WVC, their evasive actions in an
   impending WVC, their attitudes to wildlife fatalities, their strategies
   to reduce the risk of WVC, and their willingness to adopt new
   ameliorative measures. The results were partitioned by driver
   demographics and residency. Residents were generally well informed about
   mitigation strategies but exposure led to a decrease in viewing WVC as
   very serious. In addition, despite most respondents stating they
   routinely drive slower when collision risk is high (at dusk and dawn),
   our assessment of driving trends via traffic speeds suggested this
   sentiment was not generally adhered to. Thus we unveil some of the
   complexities in tackling driver's willingness to act on reducing risk of
   WVC, particularly when risk of human trauma is low.},

Title = {Municipal regulation of residential landscapes across US cities:
   Patterns and implications for landscape sustainability},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {275},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Local regulations on residential landscapes (yards and gardens) can
   facilitate or constrain ecosystem services and disservices in cities. To
   our knowledge, no studies have undertaken a comprehensive look at how
   municipalities regulate residential landscapes to achieve particular
   goals and to control management practices. Across six U.S. cities, we
   analyzed 156 municipal ordinances to examine regional patterns in local
   landscape regulations and their implications for sustainability.
   Specifically, we conducted content analysis to capture regulations aimed
   at: 1) goals pertaining to conservation and environmental management,
   aesthetics and nuisance avoidance, and health and wellbeing, and 2)
   management actions including vegetation maintenance, water and waste
   management, food production, and chemical inputs. Our results reveal
   significant variation in local and regional regulations. While
   regulatory goals stress stormwater management and nuisance avoidance,
   relatively few municipalities explicitly regulate residential yards to
   maintain property values, mitigate heat, or avoid allergens. Meanwhile,
   biological conservation and water quality protection are common goals,
   yet regulations on yard management practices (e.g., non-native plants or
   chemical inputs) sometimes contradict these purposes. In addition,
   regulations emphasizing aesthetics and the maintenance of vegetation,
   mowing of grass and weeds, as well as the removal of dead wood, may
   inhibit wildlife-friendly yards. As a whole, landscaping ordinances
   largely ignore tradeoffs between interacting goals and outcomes, thereby
   limiting their potential to support landscape sustainability.
   Recommendations therefore include coordinated, multiobjective planning
   through partnerships among planners, developers, researchers, and
   non-government entities at multiple scales.},

Abstract = {Animals from urban areas are regularly brought into wildlife
   rehabilitation centers, providing untapped potential data records to
   inform management of wildlife species. Although rescues may be
   considered a wildlife stewardship behavior, not all `rescues' may be
   warranted. Some animals are more likely to be brought into a rescue
   center than others, suggesting that human drivers underlying wildlife
   rehabilitation efforts are important to understand for urban
   conservation efforts. Literature has primarily focused on understanding
   the ecological drivers and implications of wildlife rescues. Our study
   is the first to investigate both the social and ecological drivers of
   bird rescues using census, household survey, and intake data. In Phoenix
   metropolitan area, Arizona, USA in 2017-2018, we found doves and common
   species were sent to the center most often. Altricial species (helpless
   at hatching) and young birds were more likely to be brought to the
   center, perhaps due to perceptions of young animals as vulnerable. We
   found rescues came from neighborhoods with higher incomes and residents
   with pro-ecological worldviews, perhaps reflecting a perceived
   responsibility for wildlife. Conversely, few rescues came from
   neighborhoods with a high percentage of Hispanic/Latinx residents, who
   often feel more interdependent with nature. Neighborhoods with greater
   numbers of rescues were more likely to have residents participating in
   yard stewardship activities as compared to neighborhoods with fewer
   rescues. Our findings are relevant to understanding drivers of wildlife
   stewardship actions and for intake centers who wish to reduce the
   occurrence of people bringing in wildlife that do not need to be
   rescued.},

   explored how a purposively chosen wildlife gardening program in

   government efforts to conserve indigenous biota. Sixteen semi-structured
   interviews were conducted with program members to understand the
   program's impact on their gardening and their connections with their
   council and community. Unpublished Council survey data were used to
   position interview findings on wildlife gardening activities and the
   value of program features. Interviewees detailed how they modified their
   gardening to assist their council to conserve indigenous biota. Five
   program features were implicated in this change: (1) on-site garden
   assessment; (2) indigenous community nursery; (3) communication hubs;
   (4) a framework that fosters experiential learning and community
   linkages; and (5) endorsement of each garden's potential conservation
   contribution. Collaborative wildlife gardening programs can engage

Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Private gardens have an enormous impact on urban biodiversity, making
   individual householder behavior critical to the conservation and
   enhancement of biodiversity in urban areas. Nature connectedness is
   considered to be a prerequisite for proenvironmental behavior, but how
   it manifests in private gardens is largely unexplored. Nature
   connectedness has also been found to be associated with several
   well-being dimensions. The present study investigates the associations
   between nature connectedness, biodiversity of private gardens, and
   mental wellbeing during the Covid-19 lockdown, a stressful period in
   many people's lives. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to
   analyze data from an online survey of private gardeners in two cities,
   one in Germany and one in New Zealand, in May 2020, approximately two
   months after the beginning of the first Covid-19 lockdown. Garden
   characteristics explained a significant amount of variance in depression
   symptoms during the Covid-19 lockdown. In light of rising pressures on
   urban green spaces, the findings point to the importance of private
   garden qualities for mental health and well-being. Nature connectedness
   emerged as a significant predictor of feature richness, a measure of the
   heterogeneity of habitats that support wildlife, and plant growth form
   richness in people's gardens in both city samples. Nature connectedness
   was also a significant predictor of the extent to which people
   experienced positive emotions during the Covid-19 lockdown but not
   negative emotions and depression symptoms. Our results suggest that
   nature connectedness can provide benefits for both the environment and
   people through its positive association with private garden biodiversity
   and positive emotions.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is increasingly compromising residents' connection to
   natural habitats and landscapes. With established relationships between
   human-nature connection (HNC) and pro-environmental behaviour and human
   well being, there are calls for effective interventions to strengthen
   HNC in urban settings. However, much of this research has
   operationalised HNC in narrow psychological terms. Based on an embodied
   framework of urban human-food connection (HFC) as a specific dimension
   of HNC, this article explores the role of active urban gardening in
   promoting different types of internal and external HFC and their link
   with pro-environmental food behaviour (PEFB). Based on a quantitative
   survey in Germany addressing vegetable gardeners in Munich (N = 254), a
   principal component analysis extracted four components of HFC comprising
   external body-related HFC (i.e. immediate urban garden-body activities:
   food harvesting and experiential food interaction) and internal
   mind-related HFC (i.e. immediate urban garden-mind activities including
   food discovery as well as food consciousness). These were found to be
   statistically related to one another. Furthermore, regression analysis
   revealed that food consciousness through concerns on food consumption
   and environmental impacts as well as food as part of life attitude as an
   internal HFC is the sole predictor of PEFB. The study suggests an
   embodied HFC model emphasizing the need for local body- and mind-based
   nature connections for fostering earth stewardship. Future research
   should explore the relationship between inner dimensions of nature
   connectedness and external behavioural change to enable transformations
   towards sustainability.},

   biodiversity knowledge and conservation support},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Conservation policy frequently assumes that increasing people's exposure
   to green-space enhances their knowledge of the natural world and desire
   to protect it. Urban development is, however, considered to be driving
   declining connectedness to nature. Despite this the evidence base
   supporting the assumption that visiting green-spaces promotes
   biodiversity knowledge and conservation support, and the impacts of
   urbanization on these relationships, is surprisingly limited. Using data
   from door-to-door surveys of nearly 300 residents in three pairs of
   small and large urban areas in England we demonstrate that people who
   visit green-space more regularly have higher biodiversity knowledge and
   support for conservation (measured using scales of pro-environmental
   behavior). Crucially these relationships only arise when considering
   visits to the countryside and not the frequency of visits to urban
   green-space. These patterns are robust to a suite of confounding
   variables including nature orientated motivations for visiting
   green-space, socio-economic and demographic factors, garden-use and
   engagement with natural history programs. Despite this the correlations
   that we uncover cannot unambiguously demonstrate that visiting the
   countryside improves biodiversity knowledge and conservation support. We
   consider it likely, however, that two mechanisms operate through a
   positive feedback loop i.e. increased visits to green-space promote an
   interest in and knowledge of biodiversity and support for conservation,
   which in turn further increase the desire to visit green-space and
   experience nature. The intensity of urbanization around peoples' homes,
   but not city size, is negatively associated with their frequency of
   countryside visits and biodiversity knowledge. Designing less intensely
   urbanized cities with good access to the countryside, combined with
   conservation policies that promote access to the countryside thus seems
   likely to maximize urban residents' biodiversity knowledge and support
   for conservation.},

Title = {Managing gardens for wildlife: Features that predict mammal presence and
   abundance in gardens vary seasonally},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Residential gardens in urban areas offer substantial opportunities for
   biodiversity conservation. To realize this opportunity, a comprehensive
   understanding of which species prosper in gardens, which mechanisms
   promote their use of these green spaces and how these mechanisms can be
   manipulated by residents to achieve conservation outcomes, is needed.
   While substantial progress has been made in evaluating the mechanisms
   that influence the diversity, presence, and abundance of wildlife in
   gardens, how these mechanisms vary seasonally is largely unknown. This
   study investigated whether the garden features influencing the presence
   and/or abundance of arboreal, flying, and ground-dwelling mammals in
   gardens varied seasonally using acoustic, trapping, and spotlighting
   surveys undertaken in four consecutive seasons (2018/19) in 52 gardens
   in southwestern Australia. As animal behavior and resource availability
   varies seasonally, we predicted that garden features influencing the
   presence and abundance of mammals in gardens would also vary seasonally.
   For arboreal and ground-dwelling mammals, we found that some garden
   features (e.g., canopy cover and presence of dogs, respectively) were
   important in more than one season; however, none were important in all
   seasons with most only being influential in one. No garden features
   predicted the presence of flying mammals in more than one season. Our
   results suggest that sampling in a single or few seasons may fail to
   identify features influencing wildlife at times other than in the season
   of sampling, or alternatively, may overemphasize factors that do not
   operate across all seasons. Studies that consider the mechanisms on a
   seasonal basis will provide a more comprehensive list of features
   influencing the presence and abundance of animals in gardens. We suggest
   it is both those features that support wildlife in multiple or all
   seasons, and those that support critical life-history events in a single
   season that could contribute to conservation if manipulated by residents
   appropriately.},

Abstract = {Urbanisation threatens biodiversity globally, yet some animal

   We explored the potential for residential gardens to assist the

   residents of two case study cities in Australia to identify how
   widespread mammals in cities can be, which garden features promote
   mammal presence, and if the features varied among species with different

   species with different habitat requirements occurred in residential
   gardens throughout the city landscape. Garden features promoting mammal
   presence were consistent with broad ecological and habitat requirements
   of each species, but differed among both species and regions. Our study
   demonstrates that residential gardens offer a valuable habitat for
   mammals, and that garden features could be manipulated to promote use of
   gardens by these species. By considering gardens in urban planning and
   management actions aimed at conserving urban wildlife, residential
   gardens offer additional habitat to parks, roadside vegetation and urban
   bushland, and can play a significant role in biodiversity conservation.},

Title = {A framework for catalysing the rapid scaling of urban biodiversity
   stewardship programs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {292},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Despite growing interest in promoting urban biodiversity conservation,
   there are few concrete examples of how nature stewardship initiatives
   can be rapidly scaled, in number and across landscapes. This paper
   explores the factors that promote or inhibit the proliferation and
   impact of collaborations between citizens and their local governments
   that involve residents in municipal biodiversity conservation efforts in
   their gardens (wildlife gardening). We studied the Gardens for Wildlife
   Victoria network in Australia, which supports citizen-agency
   codevelopment of municipal wildlife gardening programs. In three years
   the network has expanded from one program to 39 initiatives in various
   developmental stages in 49\% of the local government areas in the state
   of Victoria. Data are drawn from 21 semi-structured interviews of
   network participants running or developing programs in 12
   municipalities, complemented by a survey of 33 network participants, and
   participants' evaluation of network workshops. We find that scaling
   occurs in four different domains of policy, values, locales and
   participants. Scaling is influenced by six interlinked factors:
   empowerment of actors; a civil-agency co-design and delivery model;
   conservation framing; links to and between landscapes and communities;
   resources - particularly time; and the network's role in promoting
   innovation and shared learning. Key barriers include short-term,
   topdown, and monetary agency foci; conservation framed as the principal
   domain of specialists and professionals; and prioritisation of listed
   species rather than local species more broadly. We present a framework
   for considering scaling of biodiversity stewardship and related factors.},

Abstract = {As natural habitats decline and wildlife adapts to increasing
   anthropogenic disturbance, it is crucial to understand humanwildlife
   relationships in residential areas. However, relevant studies are
   limited and mostly focused on single cities. To address this knowledge
   gap, we investigated people's preferences for seeing wild mammals in
   residential areas by conducting and analyzing an online survey
   distributed across Germany (n = 2997 participants). Our results revealed
   that preferred species (squirrels, hedgehogs, hares, roe deer) were
   frequently encountered, whereas unpreferred species were those
   encountered frequently (rats, martens), as well as those encountered
   rarely (wild boar, coypus, raccoons). We also found a moderately
   positive correlation between the number of encounters with mammals and
   them being preferred by humans. Finally, some socio-demographic
   variables, particularly gender, garden access, and urbanity, are
   significantly related to human preferences. Based on our results, we
   propose tailoring wildlife management in residential areas to promote
   the positive attributes of preferred wildlife as biodiversity
   ambassadors, while also addressing ways to mitigate encounters and
   negative perceptions associated with unpreferred species.},

Abstract = {The increasing densification of urban spaces can negatively impact

   new opportunities to implement biodiversity conservation interventions.
   Urban community gardens are social-ecological systems that support
   biodiversity, ecosystem services, and positive humannature interactions.
   In turn, community gardens can provide ideal ``real-world labs{''} to
   co-create, test, and collectively implement biodiversity conservation
   strategies with gardeners that can be transferred to and mainstreamed
   across other urban ecosystems. This is important because the impact of
   biodiversity-friendly gardening strategies is not yet systematically
   researched, nor how this knowledge can be transferred to other urban
   ecosystems. In our transdisciplinary research, we are developing,
   implementing, and testing biodiversity conservation interventions
   focused on promoting insect diversity with gardeners and neighborhood
   residents from Berlin and Munich, Germany. Our aim is to engage with and
   support city residents in biodiversity-based urban greening. To do so,
   we work at the nexus between civil society (gardeners, neighborhood
   residents, ecologically oriented organizations) and relevant city actors
   (city council, district committees, city administration) to anchor the
   participation of civil society in the ecological transformation of the
   city. In this communication article, we present our transdisciplinary

Title = {An underrated habitat: Residential gardens support similar mammal
   assemblages to urban remnant vegetation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {250},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urban environments offer substantial opportunities for wildlife
   conservation as they commonly overlap the distribution of native species
   and comprise structurally complex and diverse habitats. Conservation
   strategies within urban environments currently focus on enhancing or
   maintaining natural remnant vegetation despite the variety of smaller
   greenspaces that are known to support wildlife. Residential gardens in
   particular comprise a major component of the total greenspace in urban
   areas and offer numerous resources that can be used by multiple taxa,
   and may therefore represent an important, yet unrealised opportunity for
   conservation. In this study we aimed to further the understanding of the
   potential value of gardens for biodiversity conservation by comparing
   the diversity, presence, abundance and reproductive activity of mammals
   in gardens to natural urban bushland remnants. We demonstrate that
   gardens support a similar diversity of native mammals as urban bushland
   and that the presence, abundance and reproductive activity for most
   native mammals was similar in both bushland and gardens. With the
   exception of domestic pets, the presence and abundance of introduced
   species was not higher in gardens compared to urban bushland. Our study
   highlights that the potential role of residential gardens for
   biodiversity conservation should not be overlooked. Given that novel
   urban ecosystems will continue to expand, inclusion of gardens in
   wildlife conservation and management actions is likely to greatly
   increase our ability to conserve wildlife in urban habitats.},

   resiliency, and people. The magnitude and extent of yard management
   might differ, depending on the region, specific management practices,
   the yard's size, and the yard's location along the urban to rural

   range of bird-supporting activities and are generally willing to pay a
   small amount for native songbird conservation. Demographic, cultural and

   general attitudes about conservation were found to influence these

Abstract = {Human-dominated landscapes represent one of the most rapidly expanding
   and least-understood ecosystems on earth. Yet, we know little about
   which features in these landscapes promote sustainable wildlife
   populations. Historically, in urban areas, landowners have converted
   native plant communities into habitats dominated by nonnative species
   that are not susceptible to pest damage and require little maintenance.
   However, nonnative plants are also poor at supporting insects that are
   critical food resources for higher order consumers. Despite the logical
   connection, no study has examined the impact of nonnative plants on
   subsequent population responses of vertebrate consumers. Here, we
   demonstrate that residential yards dominated by nonnative plants have
   lower arthropod abundance, forcing resident Carolina chickadees (Poecile
   carolinensis) to switch diets to less preferred prey and produce fewer
   young, or forgo reproduction in nonnative sites altogether. This leads
   to lower reproductive success and unsustainable population growth in
   these yards compared with those with >70\% native plant biomass. Our
   results reveal that properties landscaped with nonnative plants function
   as population sinks for insectivorous birds. To promote sustainable food
   webs, urban planners and private landowners should prioritize native
   plant species.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {The loss of habitat due to suburban and urban development represents one
   of the greatest threats to biodiversity. Conservation developments have
   emerged as a key player for reconciling new ex-urban residential
   development with ecosystem services. However, as more than half of the
   world population lives in urban and suburban developments, identifying
   conservation partners to facilitate retrofitting existing residential
   neighborhoods becomes paramount. Homeowner associations (HOA) manage a
   significant proportion of residential developments in the United States,
   which includes the landscape design for yards and gardens. These areas
   have the potential to mitigate the loss of urban biodiversity when they
   provide habitat for native wildlife. Therefore, the conditions and
   restrictions imposed upon the homeowner by the HOA could have profound
   effects on the local wildlife habitat. We explored the potential of HOAs
   to promote conservation by synthesizing research from three monitoring
   programs from Phoenix, Arizona. We compared native bird diversity,
   arthropod diversity, and plant diversity between neighborhoods with and
   without a HOA. Neighborhoods belonging to HOAs had significantly greater
   bird and plant diversity, although insect diversity did not differ. The
   institutional framework structuring HOAs, including sanctions for
   enforcement coupled with a predictable maintenance regime that
   introduces regular disturbance, might explain why neighborhoods with a
   HOA had greater bird diversity. For neighborhoods with a HOA, we
   analyzed landscape form and management practices. We linked these
   features with ecological function and suggested how to modify management
   practices by adopting strategies from the Sustainable Sites Initiative,
   an international sustainable landscaping program, to help support
   biodiversity in current and future residential landscapes.},

Abstract = {Urbanization along the eastern seaboard of Australia has increased the
   potential for conflict between humans and wildlife. The northern suburbs
   of Sydney are home to the southern brown (Isoodon obesulus) and the
   long-nosed bandicoot (Perameles nasuta). Both are known to enter yards
   of home owners causing a disturbance to yard plantings and an
   interaction with domestic pets. Understanding the driving factors behind
   the public's perception of bandicoots will enable wildlife managers to
   develop effective and socially acceptable conservation strategies. Six
   hundred and thirty questionnaires were distributed to the residents
   bordering Ku-ring-gai Chase and Garigal National Park in Sydney,
   Australia, to assess the sources of conflict. Eighty-three percent of
   respondents had experienced bandicoot interactions and 27\% had
   experienced interactions on a daily basis. This interaction with
   bandicoots influenced respondents' perception of a bandicoot as a
   nuisance or pest. The age of the resident and pet ownership status also
   influenced respondents' attitudes. Contrary to anecdotal reports, there
   was an overall positive response from the community. The information

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {224},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Native plant landscaping can provide unique support for native wildlife
   in urban settings, but the drivers of native plant inclusion in private
   residential yards are not well characterized. As with other
   pro-environmental behaviors, native plant landscaping is likely driven
   by a combination of resident and landscape attributes. We ask, how do
   resident attitudes, knowledge, plant choice priorities, demographics,
   and parcel structure predict existing native plant abundance? To address
   this question, we compared resident characteristics with front yard
   woody vegetation in 105 parcels in Phoenix, Arizona. Although many
   residents had positive attitudes toward native plants, less than a third
   of woody plants in most yards were native. Native woody plant abundance
   was higher in xeric rock-covered yards where residents believed native
   plants belonged in the city, prioritized choosing native plants, and had
   higher household income. Reported knowledge about native plants was low,
   but did not predict native woody plant abundance. Although native plants
   in the arid environment of Phoenix are adapted to low water conditions,
   residents who prioritized low water use plant selection had fewer native
   plants, highlighting an opportunity for native plant marketing. These
   results suggest that educational campaigns to increase resident
   knowledge of native plant identification and care are unlikely to result
   in greater native plant abundance in the residential landscape.
   Marketing native plants to highlight qualities such as low water needs
   and addressing barriers such as horticultural availability and expense
   should be further investigated as potential methods of increasing native
   plant resources in urban environments.},

Abstract = {A diversity of indigenous and alien wildlife persists in suburbia, and
   provides residents with the opportunity to experience wildlife. Suburban
   gardens may serve as refugia and foraging grounds for many primate
   species allowing them to populate within a largely urbanized landscape.
   However, this has led to the increasing human interactions with them,
   resulting in conflict. Our study investigated the perceptions of
   suburban residents towards urban vervet monkeys Cercopithecus aethiops
   pygerythrus within the Msunduzi and Ethekwini municipalities,
   KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We assessed how these related to the
   monkeys' presence, activities and interactions in residential gardens,
   and the value of wildlife to residents. Assessment was conducted through
   an online questionnaire survey. General attitudes of residents to vervet
   monkeys were canvassed by assessing the respondents' level of active
   engagement in wildlife watching within their properties. We analyzed 603
   surveys submitted online using logistic regression and ordinal
   regression models. We ascertained that vervet monkeys were disliked by
   29\% of residents due to their aggressiveness, destructive behaviour in
   gardens and households, and perceived threat to native wildlife.
   Frequency and duration of foraging vervet monkeys in residents' gardens
   was influenced by the presence of pet dogs, fruiting trees, tall trees
   (> 2 m), ratio of indigenous to alien vegetation of gardens, residency
   type, and active and passive food provisioning. Despite conflict, the
   majority of respondents appreciated urban wildlife (67\%) and actively
   engaged in wildlife watching (88\%), emphasizing the importance of
   incorporating human dimension values into the management of urban
   biodiversity. Our study highlights the value of citizen science in

Abstract = {The negative impacts of urbanization on biodiversity are well known, and
   the use of native vegetation in private gardens and streetscapes have
   been shown to improve the species richness and abundance of native
   wildlife, thereby improving the biodiversity of the local area. This
   study poses the question of whether the general public is interested in
   planting native species, to determine whether a cultural shift in garden
   planting style is feasible. A total of 3707 questionnaires relating to
   nature in the backyard were delivered to residents in metropolitan
   Melbourne, Australia with 417 responses received (11.2\% response rate).
   The results indicate that the public perception of the aesthetic appeal
   of native gardens is fairly positive and that Melbournians have
   considerable interest in planting native species in residential gardens
   and that a large number would like wildlife in their yards. The paper
   concludes that there is scope to encourage the use of native plants in
   residential landscaping. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Modeling the Influence of Public Risk Perceptions on the Adoption of
   Green Stormwater Infrastructure: An Application of Bayesian Belief
   Networks Versus Logistic Regressions on a Statewide Survey of Households
   in Vermont},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There is growing environmental psychology and behavior literature with
   mixed empirical evidence about the influence of public risk perceptions
   on the adoption of environmentally friendly ``green behaviors{''}.
   Adoption of stormwater green infrastructure on residential properties,
   while costlier in the short term compared to conventional greywater
   infrastructure, plays an important role in the reduction of nutrient
   loading from non-point sources into freshwater rivers and lakes. In this
   study, we use Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to analyze a 2015 survey
   dataset (sample size = 472 respondents) about the adoption of green
   infrastructure (GSI) in Vermont's residential areas, most of which are
   located in either the Lake Champlain Basin or Connecticut River Basin.
   Eight categories of GSI were investigated: roof diversion, permeable
   pavement, infiltration trenches, green roofs, rain gardens, constructed
   wetlands, tree boxes, and others. Using both unsupervised and supervised
   machine learning algorithms, we used Bayesian Belief Networks to
   quantify the influence of public risk perceptions on GSI adoption while
   accounting for a range of demographic and spatial variables. We also
   compare the effectiveness of the Bayesian Belief Network approach and
   logistic regression in predicting the pro-environmental behaviors
   (adoption of GSI). The results show that influencing factors for current
   adoption differ by the type of GSI. Increased perception of risk from
   stormwater issues is associated with the adoption of rain gardens and
   infiltration trenches. Runoff issues are more likely to be considered
   the governments' (town, state, and federal agencies) responsibility,
   whereas lawn erosion is more likely to be considered the residents'
   responsibility. When using the same set of variables to predict
   pro-environmental behaviors (adoption of GSI), the BBN approach produces
   more accurate predictions compared to logistic regression. The results
   provide insights for further research on how to encourage residents to
   take measures for mitigating stormwater issues and stormwater
   management.},

Abstract = {Fully understanding patterns of water use and water conservation among
   different consumer groups will help in implementing more effective water
   conservation programs worldwide. Consequently, we investigated water use
   patterns, water conservation practices, attitudes, and hindrances to
   water conservation by randomly surveying 776 households in the Weinan,
   Yanglin-Wugong, and Baoji districts in the middle of the Wei River
   Basin. The results of the study reveal that water consumption for
   domestic use of 70.2 L per capita per day (Lpcd), 31.9 L of which is
   allocated for outdoor use. Households with high water consumption
   consume more water for watering vegetable gardens and cleaning their
   houses and yards, and employ more appliances and apparatuses that use
   water. A total of 20 conservation practices were reported by of which 11
   were used by the majority of residents. Residents prefer to implement
   the most convenient and low-cost water conservation practices. The
   households with low water consumption were likely to conserve water
   because of economic concerns, but their unwillingness to change
   traditional habits prevent them from conserving water. For households
   with high water consumption groups, environmental concerns drive them to
   conserve water, their unwillingness to devote additional time and energy
   and the lack of social support are the main hindrances to water
   conservation. Public education programs on water use and conservation
   for rural communities need to fully consider these limitations to change
   traditional views and behaviors toward the use of water appliances and
   improving quality of life, as well as employing outdoor water
   conservation, pro-environmental education, and price transparency to
   promote the judicious use of water. The results obtained can be used as
   guidelines for establishing policies for community water conservation.

Title = {Insights into human-wildlife interactions in cities from bird sightings

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {196},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Interactions with nature can improve the wellbeing of urban residents
   and increase their interest in biodiversity. Many places within cities
   offer opportunities for people to interact with wildlife, including open
   space and residential yards and gardens, but little is known about which
   places within a city people use to observe wildlife. In this study, we
   used publicly available spatial data on people's observations of birds
   from three online platforms-eBird, iNaturalist, and Flickr-to determine
   where people observe birds within the city of Chicago, Illinois (USA).
   Specifically, we investigated whether land use or neighborhood
   demographics explained where people observe birds. We expected that more
   observations would occur in open spaces, and especially conservation
   areas, than land uses where people tend to spend more time, but
   biodiversity is often lower (e.g., residential land). We also expected
   that more populated neighborhoods and those with higher median age and
   income of residents would have more bird observations recorded online.
   We found that bird observations occurred more often in open spaces than
   in residential areas, with high proportions of observations in
   recreation areas. In addition, a linear regression model showed that
   neighborhoods with higher median incomes, those with larger populations,
   and those located closer to Lake Michigan had more bird observations
   recorded online. These results have implications for conservation and
   environmental education efforts in Chicago and demonstrate the potential
   for social media and citizen science data to provide insight into urban
   human-wildlife interactions.},

Abstract = {Australia's urban landscapes offer opportunities to marry socio-economic
   and biodiversity conservation objectives. Yet, information is needed on
   what urban landscape and habitat features are important for wildlife. In
   this article, we draw together our research from southeastern Australia
   to describe key lessons for biodiversity-sensitive cities and towns.
   Lesson 1: The effects of urbanization on wildlife extend into adjacent
   habitats. We recommend retaining large, undisturbed areas of habitat
   away from development, avoiding intensive development adjacent to
   important conservation areas, prioritizing areas of ecological and
   social significance, screening light and noise pollution at the urban
   fringe and around large nature reserves, and planting appropriately
   provenanced locally native species for public streetscapes, parks and
   gardens. Lesson 2: Strategic enhancement of urban greenspace offers
   biodiversity gains. We recommend increasing the total amount of
   greenspace cover, maintaining ecological structures as habitat islands,
   using landscaping techniques to minimize risks to human safety, and
   gardening with low-flowering native shrubs. Lesson 3: Large old trees
   need to be managed for long-term sustainability. We recommend retaining
   large old trees in new developments, increasing the maximum standing
   life of urban trees, protecting regenerating areas and planting more
   seedlings, supplementing habitat features associated with large trees,
   and ensuring that young trees have space to grow through time. Lesson 4:
   Education and engagement connects residents with nature and raises
   awareness. We recommend education programs to enhance opportunities for
   residents to experience and learn about biodiversity, engaging residents
   in the establishment and maintenance of wildlife habitat, providing
   `cues to care', facilitating access to garden plants that benefit
   wildlife, and encouraging cat containment. These lessons provide an
   evidence-base for implementing conservation and management actions to
   improve the capacity of our cities and towns to support a diverse and
   abundant biota.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is one of the biggest global threats to biodiversity.
   However, urban areas can offer opportunities for biodiversity
   conservation because of the assortment of resources and numerous taxa
   that occur in these habitats. While the use of gardens by animals is
   well documented, the ability of native fauna to exclusively use (i.e.
   reside in) them is largely uninvestigated and therefore constrains our
   current understanding of their conservation `value'. We aimed to
   determine whether individuals of a threatened species can exclusively
   reside in gardens for several months of their life, and the frequency
   that novel resources (i.e. non-natural) are used compared to natural
   ones. We predicted that individuals captured in gardens would use both
   bushland and residential habitat, and use natural resources more
   frequently than novel resources because of the assumption that remnant
   habitat is more suitable than modified gardens. Using the Critically
   Endangered western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis) as a
   case study, we captured 20 individuals in gardens and radio-tracked them
   for a period of 95 +/- 3.3 days to determine their habitat use. Contrary
   to our predictions, for the duration of our study individuals
   exclusively resided within gardens, irrespective of proximity to
   bushland, and used novel resources more frequently than natural
   resources for all behaviours. We also found that over half (53\%) of all
   the captured female possums had pouch young, and at the conclusion of
   the study, male possums were on average 43 g heavier. Our results
   exemplify that gardens can be of sufficient quality to support
   individuals, and that these modified habitats should be incorporated
   into conservation policy in urban landscapes. Given the extensive number
   of threatened species located within cities globally, our finding that a
   threatened species can reside exclusively within gardens further
   highlights the conservation opportunity that residential landscapes and
   cities offer wildlife.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {197},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Several organizations run wildlife-gardening programs designed to
   mitigate the biodiversity loss and disconnect between humans and
   wildlife that commonly accompanies urbanization. The National Audubon
   Society runs the Plants for Birds and the Humminbirds at Home programs
   that, like others, recommend homeowners to establish diverse assemblages
   of native plants with supplemental feeders. Here, we use plant and
   hummingbird data from the Hummingbirds at Home program to determine
   whether common wildlife-gardening recommendations correlate with
   intended outcomes. Our results showed that, after statistically
   controlling for several variables related to observer effort and
   geography, the relative occurrence and relative frequency of hummingbird
   sightings during patch surveys was positively related to the (1)
   presence of hummingbird feeders in a patch, (2) number of
   nectar-provisioning flowering-plant taxa in a patch, (3) degree to which
   nectar-provisioning flowering-plants in a patch were endemic to the
   conterminous USA, and (4) lack of impervious surface (a common proxy for
   urban development) in the surrounding landscape. These results support
   previous studies that showed how recommendations from wildlife-gardening
   programs associate with intended outcomes, but do so across an
   exceptionally broad, national extent that varies enormously in physical
   and biological geography.},

Abstract = {Community gardens are increasingly implemented in cities and considered
   in public policies regarding the range of expected benefits they can
   provide. Much research has indeed emphasized their roles for community
   gardens members, but little research still concerns residents'
   perspectives. In this paper, we explored the importance of these gardens
   for residents. More specifically, we assessed the knowledge, the
   perception and the participation of residents in the gardens. We
   conducted a questionnaire survey in the neighborhood of nine community
   gardens in Paris, France. We found that less than forty percent out of
   the 431 respondents know the activities going on in the nearby garden,
   and that these people were more often already engaged in civic
   initiatives. However, nearly hundred percent of interviewed people had a
   good perception of the gardens, based on their role in providing urban
   green spaces, in promoting contact with people and education. Finally,
   twenty percent declared frequent participation. Residents' perceptions
   and participation in community gardens depended on individuals' life
   experiences and involvement in biodiversity and civic initiatives.
   Our results highlight that city dwellers are aware of the benefits that
   community gardens can provide to them, to their neighborhood and to the
   city as a whole. These results confirm that community gardens are
   extremely important places to consider in urban planning and policy
   making, as well as in conservation research.},

Abstract = {The majority of the world's population now lives in cities, where
   reduced levels of native biodiversity, coupled with fewer opportunities
   for people to experience nature, are expected to result in an urban
   public increasingly disconnected from the natural environment.
   Residential gardens have great potential to both support native species
   and allow people daily contact with nature. Embracing the
   epistemological assumption that urban residents' interactions with
   nature in their gardens and parks may be complex, unpredictable,
   contradictory, and context-dependent, we used an interpretative
   phenomenological analysis approach to explore the human relationship
   with urban nature in a New Zealand city. We conducted 21 semi-structured
   ``go-along{''} interviews to facilitate a deeper understanding of
   participants' personal experiences of nature in parks and gardens.
   Interviews revealed a tension between stated values and concrete actions
   affecting urban biodiversity in private gardens. This value-action gap
   stemmed from the multiple purposes and values that people hold for their
   gardens, which do not necessarily align with conservation of native
   nature. By recognizing that urban residents hold multiple values and
   want their gardens to fulfill multiple purposes, local authorities
   aiming to promote nature conservation in cities can design wildlife
   gardening programs that meet these multiple needs and reconcile

Abstract = {One approach for measuring the potential biodiversity in new urban
   construction projects is through ecological models that predict how
   wildlife will respond. For the United Kingdom, such models have only
   been developed for birds, but to maximise the extent to which models
   represent overall biodiversity, species from different indicator groups
   must be considered.Here, we assess this possibility for butterflies by
   combining citizen science survey data with high-resolution digital maps.
   We derive detailed characteristics of urban landscapes around survey
   sites using previously established methods and quantify their
   relationship to counts of adults of 18 butterfly species in urban and
   peri-urban settings.Higher butterfly counts were found when traversing
   urban sites with larger areas of semi-natural grassland, other managed
   greenspaces and adjacent arable land. Most of the butterfly community
   were found to have negative relationships with highly built-up or
   fragmented landscapes.We found high species-specificity for different
   details of urban form, particularly in habitat elements such as gardens,
   vegetation around railways and grass verges.Policy implications.
   Improving biodiversity is now part of legislation governing new
   construction projects from England and Wales. However, predicting
   quantitative changes from hypothetical land-use modifications remains
   challenging. Our models provide the foundation through which butterfly
   abundance could be integrated into an urban biodiversity assessment
   tool, providing species- and community-level statistics to
   non-specialists from the urban planning and design sector. This would
   allow them to hone configurations for built surfaces, private gardens,

Abstract = {As global populations grow, cities are stretching their urban boundaries

   community attitudes towards planned management interventions in a new

   Bandicoots in new residential estates around Cranbourne, Australia. A
   survey (n=318, response rate 15.2 per cent) investigated current
   resident attitudes towards bandicoot conservation, cat ownership and
   effectiveness of current planning controls. Results indicate community
   support for a range of bandicoot conservation actions including
   confinement of domestic cats and non-lethal cat controls and for new
   developments being cat-free with bandicoot habitat corridors. Awareness
   of bandicoots correlated with higher support for conservation actions
   while cat owners were less supportive overall, particularly to
   limitations on cat ownership. Potential barriers to management
   interventions include inadequate knowledge, perceived associated risks
   and housing turnover. This information is valuable for conservation

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {The human footprint is rapidly expanding, and wildlife habitat is
   continuously being converted to human residential properties. Surviving
   wildlife that reside in developing areas are displaced to nearby
   undeveloped areas. However, some animals can co-exist with humans and
   acquire the necessary resources (food, water, shelter) within the human
   environment. This ability to coexist may be particularly true when
   development is low intensity, as in residential suburban yards. Yards
   are individually managed ``greenspaces{''} that can provide a range of
   food (e.g., bird feeders, compost, gardens), water (bird baths and
   garden ponds), and shelter (e.g., brush-piles, outbuildings) resources
   and are surrounded by varying landscape cover. To evaluate which
   residential landscape and yard features influence the richness and
   diversity of mammalian herbivores and mesopredators; we deployed
   wildlife game cameras throughout Northwestern Arkansas, USA in 46
   residential yards in summer 2021 and 96 yards in summer 2022. We found
   that mesopredator diversity had a negative relationship with fences and
   was positively influenced by the number of bird feeders present in a
   yard. Mesopredator richness increased with the amount of forest within
   400 m of the camera. Herbivore diversity and richness were positively
   correlated to the area of forest within 400 m surrounding yard and by
   garden area within yards, respectively. Our results suggest that while
   landscape does play a role in the presence of wildlife in a residential
   area, homeowners also have agency over the richness and diversity of
   mammals using their yards based on the features they create or maintain
   on their properties.},

Abstract = {Domestic gardens collectively cover substantial areas within cities and
   play an important role in supporting urban biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning. The extent of their contribution to urban biodiversity is
   ultimately determined by the attitudes, motivations, and practices of
   their owners. We identified variables characterizing individual
   householders and their properties that explained variation in perennial
   plant and avian species richness and plant diversity among 55 gardens in
   New Zealand. The size of the vegetated area was most important in
   explaining bird and plant diversity, independent of property size. Also
   important and positively associated with plant richness were
   socio-economic status and ability to discriminate between native and
   exotic species. Median housing age and neighborhood green space were
   less important. Contrary to expectations, better educated householders
   who demonstrated pro-environmental orientation (NEP) did not necessarily
   have gardens with greater plant diversity, however, people with higher
   NEP scores tended to have gardens with more structurally complex
   vegetation. Similar variables were important in explaining native and
   exotic species richness, but higher exotic plant diversity was
   associated with older people with smaller properties of lower value.
   Avian species richness increased primarily with vegetated area, but also
   the areas of beds and hedges. We demonstrate that although householder
   knowledge is an important determinant of garden biodiversity, vegetated
   area is most important. Promoting urban garden biodiversity requires
   that larger vegetated properties be supported and encouraged, and that
   planners should consider biodiversity when formulating policies
   concerning garden size, property size, and consents that may result in a
   progressive increase in the proportion of built over/paved areas.},

Title = {Examining the potential to expand wildlife-supporting residential yards
   and gardens},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {222},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Research has demonstrated that residential yards can provide important
   habitat for urban birds, pollinators, and other wildlife. In addition,
   the motivations and constraints underlying decisions to manage
   traditional lawns, water-conserving yards, native plants, and other
   landscape types are well understood. Yet relatively little research has
   addressed people's decisions to adopt wildlife-supporting yards.
   Analyzing survey data from six U.S. cities, we address three related
   questions: 1) to what extent do residents choose yard features that
   support wildlife habitat?; 2) how do yard priorities and neighborhood
   governance, along with socio-demographic factors, explain the adoption
   of wildlife-supporting features?; and 3) how do residents who have
   already adopted wildlife-supporting yard features differ in their
   motivations from those who plan to adopt such features and those who do
   not? We found significant potential for adding vegetation (specifically
   shrubs and native plants) and other wildlife-supporting features to
   increase yard complexity and vegetation diversity. While gardening as a
   hobby was a significant motivator for people who have adopted wildlife
   yard features, the desire for low maintenance yards is a constraint
   among non-adopters. We therefore recommend promoting the planting of
   low-maintenance plant species or varieties that provide wildlife habitat
   but require little upkeep, especially among residents who would like to
   attract wildlife to their yards into the future. We also found that
   neighbourhood and homeowner associations increase the local adoption of
   wildlife-supporting yards. Coupled with other findings, our results
   underscore the importance of tailoring residential landscape features to
   diverse lifestyles while leveraging social institutions to expand
   wildlife habitat across urban and suburban neighborhoods.},

Abstract = {Indigenous belief systems and informal institutions that result in the
   conservation of wild species or sites exemplify biocultural
   conservation. The erosion of cultural beliefs and practices can have
   adverse, often severe, consequences for biodiversity. We explored the
   relationships among informal institutions, religion, and human attitudes
   toward sacred populations of a threatened, endemic species, Sclater's
   monkey (Cercopithecus sclateri), in two communities in southeastern
   Nigeria. Due to habitat loss and hunting pressure across the species'
   range, monkeys in these two sites live alongside people, raid farms and
   gardens, and are commonly viewed as pests. Using structured (n = 410)
   and semi-structured (n = 21) interviews, we examined factors influencing
   residents' views of the monkeys, mechanisms affecting adherence to
   social taboos against harming monkeys, and implications for
   conservation. Our analyses revealed that most residents, particularly
   those from one community, women, and farmers, held negative opinions of
   the monkeys. Crop and garden raiding by monkeys had the most adverse
   effect on people's attitudes. Although the adoption of Christianity
   weakened residents' views regarding the no-killing taboos, continued
   adherence to the taboos was particularly influenced by supernatural
   retribution in one site and community disapproval in the other. Only one
   community widely conferred symbolic importance on the monkeys. Such site
   differences illustrate the value of local cultural understanding in
   conservation. Pre-intervention studies of this nature allow for the
   development of locally and culturally sensitive conservation programs,
   as well as better-informed assessments of what interventions are most
   likely to be effective.},

   (landscape) architects, ii) urban developers and engineers, iii)
   homeowners and tenants, iv) companies and industries, v) landscaping and
   gardening firms, vi) education professionals. Given that motivation to
   act positively for urban birds is linked to stakeholder-specific advice,
   we present ten statements for bird-friendly cities that are guided by an
   action perspective and argument for each stakeholder group. We conclude
   with a discussion on how the use of stakeholder-specific arguments can

Title = {Species traits explain public perceptions of human-bird interactions},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The impacts of urbanization on bird biodiversity depend on
   human-environment interactions that drive land management. Although a
   commonly studied group, less attention has been given to public
   perceptions of birds close to home, which can capture people's direct,
   everyday experiences with urban biodiversity. Here, we used ecological
   and social survey data collected in the metropolitan region of Phoenix,
   Arizona, USA, to determine how species traits are related to people's
   perceptions of local bird communities. We used a trait-based approach to
   classify birds by attributes that may influence human-bird interactions,
   including color, size, foraging strata, diet, song, and cultural niche
   space based on popularity and geographic specificity. Our classification
   scheme using hierarchical clustering identified four trait categories,
   labeled as Metropolitan (gray, loud, seedeaters foraging low to ground),
   Familiar (yellow/brown generalist species commonly present in suburban
   areas), Distinctive (species with distinguishing appearance and song),
   and Hummingbird (hummingbird species, small and colorful). Strongly held
   beliefs about positive or negative traits were also more consistent than
   ambivalent ones. The belief that birds were colorful and unique to the
   regional desert environment was particularly important in fortifying
   perceptions. People largely perceived hummingbird species and birds with
   distinctive traits positively. Similarly, urban-dwelling birds from the
   metropolitan trait group were related to negative perceptions, probably
   due to human-wildlife conflict. Differences arose across
   sociodemographics (including income, age, education, and Hispanic/Latinx
   identity), but explained a relatively low amount of variation in
   perceptions compared with the bird traits present in the neighborhood.
   Our results highlight how distinctive aesthetics, especially color and
   song, as well as traits related to foraging and diet drive perceptions.
   Increasing people's direct experiences with iconic species tied to the
   region and species with distinguishing attributes has the potential to
   improve public perceptions and strengthen support for broader
   conservation initiatives in and beyond urban ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Urban landscapes present substantial opportunities for biodiversity
   conservation with residential gardens offering some of the greatest
   potential conservation gains given that they represent a significant
   proportion of the total greenspace in urbanised landscapes. However,
   knowledge of wildlife ecology within gardens remains scarce, likely due
   to the difficulties associated with field ecologists accessing privately
   owned areas. Citizen-sourced data presents an alternative approach to
   typical field-based investigations and could be used to develop an
   extensive understanding of biodiversity within privately owned green
   spaces, providing concerns of data unreliability could be overcome. Here
   we i) examine the potential for urban householders to identify a
   threatened nocturnal mammal, in the presence of a similar non-threatened
   species, ii) examine which attributes can predict the level of accuracy
   in householders' species identifications and iii) investigate how their
   self-reported level of certainty affects identification reliability. We
   found up to 80\% agreement between householders and experienced
   ecologists when we assessed presence and absence of nocturnal mammals on
   urban properties. The amount of time a householder had lived at their
   residence was a significant predictor of accuracy for mammal species
   identification, suggesting that familiarity with a site enhances the
   accuracy of citizen science data. Those people with a high level of
   certainty in their ability to correctly identify nocturnal mammals were
   no more likely to show higher species identification accuracy than those
   with low certainty. In urban areas, where ecological surveys for
   nocturnal taxa are especially challenging, our results inspire optimism
   that householders can add to the body of knowledge about biodiversity
   persisting in these landscapes, especially on properties where they have
   resided for at least one year.},

Abstract = {Within the expanding city of Brisbane in south-east Queensland, numerous
   fragments of native and regrowth vegetation are scattered across the
   largely urbanised landscape. These fragments provide refuge to a great
   diversity of native wildlife, and, provide residents with the
   opportunity to experience nature on their doorstep. To assess the
   diversity and abundance of this wildlife, recent changes in these
   parameters, and the value of wildlife and bushland fragments to
   residents of Brisbane, a questionnaire survey was distributed to 300
   households each located adjacent to one of 38 urban bushland fragments.
   A total of 172 surveys (57\%) were returned, producing 768 records of 83
   fauna species, dominated by birds and mammals; bandicoots were widely
   reported from the 38 fragments. Several historical records provided
   evidence of recent local extinctions within fragments, highlighting the
   continuing declines in various species of native wildlife within
   Brisbane. Several human-wildlife conflicts were identified, but overall
   residents were tolerant of such conflicts. Bandicoots were disliked by a
   small minority (3\%) of residents owing to the holes they dig in lawns
   and gardens in search of food. and their potential as vectors of ticks.
   Most respondents expressed ail appreciation for the presence of native
   wildlife (96\%) and bushland fragments (97\%) in their local area,
   emphasising the importance of incorporating human dimension values into
   the management of this urban biodiversity.},

Number = {4},
Pages = {761-771},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The human population is increasingly disconnected from nature due to
   urbanisation. To counteract this phenomenon, the UK government has been
   actively promoting wildlife gardening. However, the extent to which such
   activities are conducted and the level of resource provision for
   biodiversity (e.g., food and nesting sites) within domestic gardens
   remains poorly documented. Here we generate estimates for a selection of
   key resources provided within gardens at a national scale, using 12
   survey datasets gathered across the UK. We estimate that 22.7 million
   households (87\% of homes) have access to a garden. Average garden SiZe
   is 190 m(2), extrapolating to a total area of 432,924 ha. Although
   substantial, this coverage is still an order of magnitude less than that
   of statutory protected areas. Approximately 12.6 million (48\%)
   households provide supplementary food for birds, 7.4 million of which
   specifically use bird feeders. Similarly, there are a minimum of 4.7
   million nest boxes within gardens. These figures equate to one bird
   feeder for every nine potentially feeder-using birds in the UK, and at
   least one nest box for every six breeding pairs of cavity nesting birds.
   Gardens also contain 2.5-3.5 million ponds and 28.7 million trees, which
   is just under a quarter of all trees occurring outside woodlands.
   Ongoing urbanisation, characterised by increased housing densities, is
   inevitable throughout the UK and elsewhere. The important contribution
   domestic gardens make to the green space infrastructure in residential
   areas must be acknowledged, as their reduction will impact biodiversity
   conservation, ecosystem services, and the well-being of the human
   population. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Testing the Likeable, Therefore Abundant Hypothesis: Bird Species
   Likeability by Urban Residents Varies Significantly with Species Traits},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The urbanization of landscapes filters bird communities to favor
   particular species traits, driven in part by the changes that homeowners
   make to the amount and quality of habitat in yards. We suggest that an
   ultimate driver of these proximate mechanisms underlying bird community
   change with respect to urbanization is the likeability of species traits
   by urban residents. We hypothesize that bird species likeability,
   modulated by species traits, influences the degree to which homeowners
   alter the availability and quality of habitat on their properties and
   thereby affects species population sizes in urbanized landscapes. We
   refer to this new hypothesis as the Likeable, therefore Abundant
   Hypothesis. The Likeable, therefore Abundant Hypothesis predicts that
   (1) bird species likeability varies with species morphological and
   behavioral traits, (2) homeowners use trait-based likeability as a
   motivator to modify habitat availability and quality on their
   properties, and (3) residential habitat availability and quality
   influences species populations at landscape scales. We tested the first
   prediction of the Likeable, therefore Abundant Hypothesis using a survey
   of 298 undergraduate students at the University of North Carolina at
   Charlotte who were asked to rank their preferences for 85 forest
   generalist and edge/open country songbird species grouped according to
   10 morphological and behavioral traits. Survey respondents preferred
   very small, primarily blue or black species that are insectivorous,
   aerial or bark foragers, residents, and culturally unimportant. On the
   other hand, respondents disliked large or very large, primarily yellow
   or orange species that forage on the ground and/or forage by
   flycatching, are migratory, and are culturally important. If the
   Likeable, therefore Abundant Hypothesis is true, natural resource
   managers and planners could capitalize on the high likeability of
   species that are nevertheless negatively affected by urbanization to
   convince homeowners and residents to actively manage their properties
   for species conservation.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is recognized as one of the greatest threats to
   biodiversity throughout the world. However, the vegetation within an
   urbanized landscape is diverse and includes a variety of native and
   exotic plant species. This variation allows for testing whether certain
   landscape designs outperform others in the support of native
   biodiversity. Residential yards represent a large component of an urban
   landscape and, if managed collectively for birds and other wildlife,
   could offset some of the negative effects of urbanization. In addition,
   many urbanites have their primary interaction with the natural world in
   their front and back yards. Therefore, ensuring positive wildlife
   experiences for them is essential in promoting urban biodiversity. At
   the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research site we tested
   the efficacy of native landscaping in residential yards in attracting
   native birds. We also explored the links between socioeconomic factors,
   landscape designs, and urban gradient measurements with the urban bird
   communities. A redundancy analysis suggested that native desert bird
   species increased in abundance in neighborhoods with desert landscaping
   designs, neighborhoods closer to large desert tracts, and higher-income
   neighborhoods. Variance partitioning showed that collectively these
   three sets of environmental variables explained almost 50\% of the
   variation in the urban bird community. Results suggested racial and
   economic inequities in access to biodiversity, whereby predominantly
   Hispanic and lower-income neighborhoods had fewer native birds. We also
   found that residents' satisfaction with bird diversity was positively
   correlated with actual bird diversity. Our study provides new insights
   into the relative importance of socioeconomic variables and common urban
   ecological measurements in explaining urban bird communities. Urban
   planners can use this information to develop residential landscapes that
   support the well-being of both birds and people.},

Title = {Biodiversity conservation in urban gardens - Pets and garden design
   influence activity of a vulnerable digging mammal},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Residential gardens can provide essential opportunities for native
   wildlife and represent a valuable way of creating new habitats.
   Bandicoots (marsupial family Peramelidae) are medium-sized digging
   mammals that play a valuable role in maintaining ecosystem health;
   retaining these important ecosystem engineers across urban landscapes,
   including in private gardens, can have enormous conservation benefits.
   Urbanisation is a significant threat for some bandicoot species, and
   therefore understanding the factors associated with their activity can
   help guide urban landscape and garden design. To identify key features
   associated with the activity of a local endemic bandicoot species, the
   quenda (Isoodon fusciventer), we carried out a camera trap survey of
   front and back yards for 65 residential properties in the City of
   Mandurah, Western Australia. We compared quenda activity with biotic and
   abiotic factors that could indicate potential predation risk (activity
   of domestic dogs Canis familiaris and cats Felis catus, and the presence
   of artificial or natural protective cover), food availability (including
   deliberate or inadvertent supplementary feeding, provision of water, and
   diggable surfaces) and garden acces-sibility (distance to bushland,
   permeability of boundary fencing, and garden position). Supplementary
   feeding was strongly associated with quenda activity. Quenda were also
   more active in back yards, and in gardens where there was greater
   vegetation cover. Of concern, quenda activity was positively associated
   with cat activity, which could reflect that straying pet cats are
   attracted to gardens that harbour wildlife populations, including
   quenda. Furthermore, almost half of the gardens showed cat activity
   despite only a small sample of the surveyed residents owning a pet cat.

Abstract = {Urban agriculture is a unique form of agriculture that can provide
   fresh, local produce for urban residents, and may benefit biodiversity
   by decreasing the need to expand agriculture into natural areas as well
   as enhancing biodiversity in urban areas. However, although urban
   agriculture is also often cited as promoting biodiversity in urban
   areas, the extent of empirical evidence for such claims has not been
   studied. Here we systematically review the relationship between urban
   agriculture and biodiversity in the scientific literature. We strictly
   define urban agriculture as areas in cities that grow produce
   specifically for human consumption. We examined 148 papers from 2000 to
   2017, of which only 24 studies fit our definition of urban agriculture,
   and of those, only 18 both involved urban agriculture and measured
   biodiversity. Of the studies that did measure biodiversity, some showed
   increases in diversity compared to urban vacant lots, but other showed
   no difference. Moreover, these studies were mostly focused on plants and
   invertebrates and were conducted almost exclusively in North America. In
   order to use the generalization that urban agriculture will have a
   positive influence on urban biodiversity, more studies will need to be
   conducted across a wider geographic range worldwide (particularly in
   developing countries in the tropics) and on a greater diversity of
   species and taxa (e.g., herpetiles, birds and small mammals). Such
   studies will likely increase in conservation importance as urban
   expansion and agricultural demands increase globally.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Western Australia (WA) is experiencing severe water shortages associated
   with a drying climate. Suburban gardens in and around WA's capital city
   of Perth however, continue to be dominated by water dependent European
   style gardens featuring green lawns and introduced species. One area in
   metropolitan Perth going against this norm is the local government
   district of Fremantle. Residents within this city council have shown
   widespread adoption of native gardens: a seemingly obvious means of
   reducing water use and increasing local biodiversity. In an endeavour to
   understand the differences in garden design preferences, the aim of this
   research was to explore cultural and psychological drivers of native
   gardening within the city of Fremantle. Twelve in-depth, face-to-face
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with Fremantle homeowners.
   Participants had converted their garden from a traditional European
   design in favour of an aesthetic based on native species. Drivers such
   as knowledge, functionality, and social norms emerged, and interestingly
   resembled the same sorts of drivers previously identified as driving
   European style gardening practices in Australia. We account for the
   tension of same drivers yet different design due to differences in
   social and cultural values. Specifically, the dominant worldview in
   Fremantle is pro-environmental and this driver appears to shape the
   social context in which gardening decisions are made, making for a more
   accepting setting for residents to adopt alternative garden designs.
   Findings from this research are of value to water and environmental
   policy makers, urban local governments, and environmental educators. (c)

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {184},
Pages = {424-430},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The long-term success of conservation projects, particularly in urban
   areas, often depends on local buy-in and participation. However, it can
   be difficult to recruit local residents to participate in
   community-based management. Here we use an urban conservation project in
   Yokohama, the second largest city in Japan, as a case study to examine
   the factors associated with the willingness of residents to participate
   in five different conservation-related activities. We aimed to
   understand important factors that consist urban environmental
   stewardship and civic ecology in an Asian culture; japan. Our survey of
   residents suggests that participation was related to an individual's
   expectation that participating in the conservation activity would
   enhance social interactions among residents, their belief that the urban
   area lacked adequate ``green{''} habitat features, such as gardens and
   other plantings, and their sense of responsibility to maintain the
   quality of the environment. Additionally, younger residents were more
   willing to participate than older residents. Our results suggest that
   emphasizing social interactions in conservation activities and
   highlighting the need for and social and aesthetic benefits of
   conservation improvements could enhance participation in these
   conservation activities. Particular motivating factors may vary from
   place to place, particularly across cultural boundaries, but some
   factors appear to be general across cultures. In cultures that emphasize
   collective responsibility and action, such as in Japan, it may be
   important to foster residents' sense that it is their responsibility to
   conserve the natural environment. We believe that greater understanding
   of the interests and motivation of the public to participate in
   conservation projects will enhance their efficacy. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Assessing the strategic role of urban green spaces for habitat
   connectivity in multi-family residential plots},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {99},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Urban green spaces are key for maintaining and restoring habitat
   connectivity within cities. Despite substantial investigations on the
   contribution to connectivity of different types of urban green spaces,
   the specific contribution of green spaces located in multifamily
   residential (MFR) plots has yet to be assessed. Estimating this
   contribution is crucial given the multiple roles fulfilled by these
   green spaces in urban planning. To achieve this goal, we focused on four
   taxa: the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), the Red squirrel
   (Sciurus vulgaris), forest passerine birds and moths. We assessed the
   potential habitat connectivity for each taxon across the metropolitan
   urban area of Lyon (France), with landscape graphs built using 1-metre
   resolution land cover maps. Considering the current state as a
   reference, we then designed five land cover change scenarios affecting
   habitat distribution in the MFR plots: (i) maximum and (ii) minimum
   theoretical connectivity (references), (iii) improve quality of existing
   green spaces, (iv) improve quantity of green spaces with sub-optimal
   quality and, (v) maximum restoration (management scenarios). The taxon-
   and scenario-specific impacts highlight the crucial contribution of
   private spaces to habitat connectivity. For all taxa, while the MFR only
   cover 8 \% of the study area, connectivity would increase by up to 60\%
   if these plots were greened. In contrast, sealing these plots could
   reduce overall connectivity by up to 40 \%. The interpolation of local
   connectivity metrics for each habitat patch and each MFR plot allowed us
   to identify the most relevant plots for urban greening. Because our
   approach can improve habitat connectivity at different scales, from
   neighbourhoods to entire urban areas, it could prove useful for
   landscape planning in most urban settings.},

   behavior for wildscape gardening},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Achieving conservation outcomes requires concerted engagement from many
   people across diverse societies. However, many conservation
   practitioners struggle to engage new audiences. Research suggests one
   effective strategy to reach nonengaged individuals is to encourage
   interested conservation actors to share information, provide resources
   and assistance, and organize local events to recruit others; we call
   these ``diffusion behaviors.{''} Previous studies suggest few
   conservation actors who engage in personal-sphere PEB also engage in
   diffusion PEB, potentially because these behaviors have unique barriers
   which have yet to be identified. We investigated if there are different
   psychosocial drivers of diffusion and personal-sphere PEB by surveying
   residents in Colorado, USA about their personal-sphere wildscape
   behaviors (e.g. planting native plants) and diffusion wildscape
   behaviors (e.g. helping a friend plant native plants). Including
   diffusion-specific psychosocial variables led to better predictions of
   both personal-sphere and diffusion PEB. Diffusion-specific
   self-efficacy, social and environmental response efficacy, and
   reputational concerns about perceived competence were significant
   predictors of diffusion behavior. Diffusion-specific environmental
   response efficacy and injunctive norms enforced through sanctioning
   significantly predicted personal-sphere behavior. Personal-sphere
   self-efficacy and dynamic norm beliefs predicted both behavior types.
   Our findings suggest that research should consider personal-sphere and
   diffusion PEB as distinct domains and should investigate the power of
   diffusion-specific perceptions. Conservation outreach programs seeking
   to encourage diffusion of PEB may benefit from designing programming to
   try to change these perceptions.},

Title = {Barriers to Native Plantings in Private Residential Yards},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In urban areas, private yards can make up large portions of the
   available ``green space{''} which can be used to provide resources for
   many species, including birds, and pollinators. If residents are
   persuaded or willing to plant certain native plants, the aggregate
   effect of these plantings could be hugely beneficial for key pollinator
   species. The objectives of this study are to uncover impediments to
   adding different types of pollinator-beneficial plants to private yards,
   as well as ascertain which incentives to plant these native plants might
   be most persuasive, and finally determine if there are procedural
   knowledge gaps in how to plant, care for, or where to purchase three
   pollinator-beneficial plants. In this study, we randomly selected
   properties in two counties in southwestern Ohio along two gradients:
   parcel size and parcel valuation (as a proxy for income). Two hundred
   surveys were distributed and 113 were returned (57\% response rate). We
   find that, in aggregate, respondents do not have a strong intent to
   plant these native plants, especially Asclepias syriaca (a milkweed that
   serves as host plant to the iconic monarch butterfly; Danaus plexippus)
   and, surprisingly, the intent to plant these does not differ
   statistically even when help with costs, labor, or the provision of
   online resources are offered. We also find that the reported knowledge
   of where to purchase wildflowers is significantly higher than how to
   care for them and how to plant them. Lastly, respondents are much more
   confident in how to take care of trees compared to the three
   pollinator-beneficial plants shown in the survey. We discuss the
   implications of these findings for outreach and extension purposes.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on Dutch perspectives on the issue of gardening for
   biodiversity and sustainable urban environments. A semi-qualitative
   survey based on multiple choice, open, and visual questions were
   conducted with a representative sample of the Dutch population (N =
   517). The aim of the survey was to get a better insight into the way
   Dutch domestic gardens contribute to urban sustainability and
   biodiversity conservation. Cultural Theory was used as a heuristic
   framework for survey design and analysis. The results show that the
   Dutch population is best represented by the Egalitarian and the
   Hierarchist perspectives. The Egalitarian perspective has strong
   ecological ideals, but these ideals are not reflected in how most of
   them design and maintain their gardens in practice. There seems to be a
   strong cognitive dissonance in the relation between a majority of the
   Dutch garden owners and the design and maintenance of their gardens.
   Only a small group of people with an Autonomous perspective is able to
   bring their high ecological ideals into practice in their yards. The
   Individualist perspective group has least ideological and practical
   concern for gardening, sustainability and biodiversity. The results have
   been discussed in the context of global goals for sustainable cities and
   biodiversity, as reflected in the Aichi targets and the Sustainable
   Development Goals. The paper intends to provide policymakers and urban
   planners with levers to experiment with incentives to bridge gaps
   between private space and public interests (the public/private dilemma).},

Abstract = {Residential garden ponds contribute significantly to the available
   aquatic habitat within urban landscapes. Although garden ponds have
   novel biotic and abiotic characteristics, they are used by a variety of
   wildlife. However, whether they support healthy animals, reproduction
   and recruitment, critical for longer-term sustainability, is largely
   unknown. We addressed this knowledge gap using frogs as a case study
   taxon by investigating species assemblage, size (snout-vent length,
   SVL), body condition (scaled mass index, SMI), reproduction and
   recruitment in urban gardens with ponds relative to natural wetlands in
   southwestern Australia. Based on monthly sampling of 21 urban gardens
   and 6 wetlands between September 2023 and March 2024, we found that
   gardens supported a less diverse species assemblage than wetlands.
   Garden frogs were up to 39.5\% longer in SVL but did not differ in SMI
   to those in wetlands. Of species occurring in both habitats, 75\% (3)
   called earlier and/or for longer in gardens compared to wetlands. Over
   40\% of garden ponds supported reproduction of motorbike frogs (Litoria
   moorei) and of these 45\% supported recently metamorphosed juveniles.
   Reproduction of the other species in gardens was minimal. This study is
   one of few to investigate the ability of urban habitats to support
   critical aspects of life history and demonstrates that residential
   garden ponds can sustain healthy adults, reproduction and recruitment

Abstract = {Integrated pest management and outdoor water conservation comprise key

   Dis-connects among diverse audiences and educational programs pose
   challenges in achieving the goals of these types of programs. To discern
   a potential nonformal educational programming strategy, we conducted
   audience segmentation research incorporating residential environmental
   landscape best management practices and compared resulting subgroups'
   characteristics. We explored this paradigm through the context of
   Extension education and used a nationally-distributed electronic survey
   instrument to measure well-being and landscape management perceptions
   and practices in the United States. We collected 2601 complete survey
   responses and employed cluster analysis to divide the respondents into
   homogenous subgroups, followed by analysis of vari-ance and chi-square
   analyses to identify differences among the subgroups. The group that
   indicated the highest level of engagement with water conservation and
   IPM practices also had significantly higher well-being, demonstrating
   the potential to align IPM education with more commonly promoted
   conservation practices. Membership in the highest IPM and water
   conservation group was related to several socio-demographic
   char-acteristics, including age, homeownership, and homeowners'
   association membership. This group was also most likely to engage with
   educational programs. Understanding these indicators of engagement in

   higher well-being, may be useful in determining target audiences and

   on a personal level and in terms of wider impacts.
   Aims In this study, we evaluate the social outcomes of a participatory
   wildlife conservation project in an urban area in north-east England,
   using hedgehogs as the focal species.
   Methods Based on an approach of community volunteers working alongside
   scientific researchers in an evaluation of hedgehog urban habitat use,
   we examine the transformative effects of this involvement at the
   individual and community levels via qualitative semi-structured
   interviews with community volunteers.
   Key results Participants were motivated by personal wellbeing factors
   such as enjoying proximity to the study species, learning and social
   factors. Participation in the study itself indicates a degree of
   motivation for engaging with a study of this sort. Nevertheless,
   involvement in the study was a successful vehicle for increasing
   participants' engagement with nature both during the study and
   potentially into the future, particularly in terms of biological
   recording and gardening for wildlife.
   Conclusions Participation in a wildlife study is a positive experience
   for many volunteers, leading to actual and potential changes in both
   personal and wider social outcomes.
   Implications Participatory initiatives such as the one described have an
   important role to play in signposting and supporting volunteers to
   follow future environmental aspirations and maximise the personal and
   social benefits associated with participation. This could be enhanced by
   ensuring that volunteering opportunities are linked in with pre-existing
   community-based networks that can act as advocates for environmental and
   wildlife conservation.},

Title = {Factors influencing butterfly and bumblebee richness and abundance in
   gardens},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {908},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Gardens are often depicted as green sanctuaries, providing refuges for
   wildlife displaced from the countryside due to intensive farming. While
   gardens have been recognized for their positive impact on biodiversity
   conservation, few studies have investigated the impact of pesticide
   usage in domestic gardens. In this study, we explored how butterfly and
   bumblebee populations in gardens across the UK are influenced by habitat
   quality, urbanisation level and pesticide use. To achieve this, we
   engaged with participants in Garden BirdWatch, a weekly garden wildlife
   recording scheme operated by the British Trust for Ornithology.
   Participants in the study provided data on the attributes of their
   garden and surrounding area and were asked to complete a questionnaire
   about their pesticide practices. Of the 417 gardens from which we
   obtained useful data, we found that 32.6 \% had pesticides applied to.
   Urbanisation and garden quality were the main factors influencing insect
   populations. Butterfly richness was lower in suburban and urban gardens
   and butterfly abundance lower only in suburban gardens when compared to
   rural gardens, but this relationship did not hold for bumblebees.
   Abundance of butterflies and bumblebees, but not their species richness,
   increased with the habitat quality of gardens. Butterflies were lower in
   abundance and richness in more northerly gardens, which was not the case
   for bumblebees. Effects of pesticides were relatively weak, but
   butterfly richness was 7 \% lower in gardens applying any pesticide.
   Overall, our study shows that garden butterfly and bumblebee abundance
   and richness are strongly influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic
   factors, and that garden management can have an important positive
   effect on insect population.},

Abstract = {Large parts of urban space around the world exist of small-scale plots

   for enhancing biodiversity, sustainability and ecosystem services in and

   the choice for exotic species that may become invasive over time.
   Yard-management decisions can also positively influence the presence of
   pollinators, improve soil quality or even foster small scale `Wildlife
   Habitats' that can function as ecological stepping stones to the wider

Abstract = {Understanding patterns of habitat selection and factors affecting space
   use is fundamental in animal conservation. In urban landscapes, such
   knowledge can be used to advise householders on how best to manage their
   gardens for wildlife. In this study, we tracked 28 West European
   hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), a species of conservation concern in
   the UK, in an area of high-density housing using radio and GPS tags to
   quantify patterns of habitat use and identify factors associated with
   the proportion of time spent in individual gardens. Both males and
   females exhibited a preference for residential gardens, but there were
   subtle differences between the sexes in relation to house type and front
   versus back gardens. Hedgehogs spent significantly more time in gardens
   where artificial food was provided, where a compost heap was present, if
   foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were infrequent visitors, if it rained overnight
   and as daylength increased (i.e., shorter nights); garden use was not
   significantly associated with variables potentially likely to reflect
   invertebrate prey abundance. These data suggest that the primary
   positive action that householders can undertake for urban hedgehogs is
   providing supplementary food. However, householders often feed hedgehogs
   after they know they are already visiting their garden. Consequently,
   the presence of artificial food may make it difficult to identify other
   important influences affecting garden use. Finally, we report that a GPS
   fix acquisition rate < 60\% likely had no major effect on the results of
   our analyses, but should be a consideration in future studies using this
   technique on this species and in this habitat.},

Abstract = {Although urban domestic gardens hold great significance for biodiversity
   support in cities, these habitats have been relatively insufficiently
   studied, especially in developing country contexts. This paper assesses
   the composition, diversity, density and distribution of plant vegetation
   in urban domestic gardens in the rapidly expanding south Indian city of
   Bangalore. Overall species diversity is high, with 1,668 trees from 91
   species, as well as 192 species of herbs and shrubs encountered from a
   total sample of 328 urban single domestic gardens and shared apartment
   gardens distributed across the city. The majority of species were
   uncommon, found in less than 5 \% of all sampled locations. A high
   proportion of about 30 \% of all species had uses as food or as spices,
   medicinal properties, and/or religious significance. In general, large
   shared apartment gardens and single domestic gardens had a greater
   number of trees with larger size, and greater tree and herb/shrub
   diversity compared to small shared apartment gardens and small to
   moderate sized single domestic gardens. Shared apartment gardens tended
   to harbor relatively distinct sets of species, especially trees, palms
   and plants with largely ornamental significance, while single domestic
   gardens contained a greater proportion of flowering and medicinal plants
   used in daily worship, as well as fruit bearing and spice bearing plants
   and trees. Residents observed a wide range of other animal and insect
   species in their gardens, but also indicated a decrease in wildlife
   biodiversity over time. The majority of residents observed some cultural
   practices associated with feeding of urban wildlife and insects
   including the provision of rice and water for birds, and of sugar for
   ants. The results of this research provide a comprehensive description
   of plant diversity and distribution in single domestic gardens and
   shared apartment gardens of different sizes, which can be very important
   for citizen groups, planners and administrators working towards urban
   planting and greening in the south Indian city of Bangalore. They also
   supplement the extremely limited information currently available on
   urban domestic gardens outside of cities in the west.},

Abstract = {Home gardens are an important topic for landscape research due to their
   intersectional contributions to plant diversity conservation and local
   livelihoods. As sites of ecological restoration, gardens transform
   small-scale landscapes toward higher plant richness and density. We
   examine ``gardenscapes{''} on St. Eustatius, a small Caribbean island,
   focusing on how plants growing around a home contribute to ecological
   and ethnobotanical measures of plant diversity, and how residents value
   the importance of gardens to their livelihoods. Through a survey of 14
   gardenscapes and 11 home interviews, we report 277 plant species,
   including 31\% native and 69\% non-native, high plant densities and
   structural evenness, 260 plants with uses, and a total of 363 uses,
   especially as ornamental plants (184) and for other environmental
   services (16), but also food (101), health remedies (50), material uses
   (10) and symbolic services (2). Participants indicated that home
   gardening could be difficult due to drought and pests, but provided
   resources and incomes to livelihoods, especially through the production
   of food products. Several respondents reported that gardening was a
   declining activity on St. Eustatius, but this study shows how gardening

   plant diversity and livelihoods across the island's highly-modified

   the road verge},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {44},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Verge gardening is a citizen-led form of public urban greening where
   residents plant and maintain understorey and trees in the road easement,
   and it has the potential to significantly increase the diversity and
   complexity of street greenery which is, most commonly, mown grass and
   monocultures of street trees. In Melbourne, Australia, two forms of
   verge gardening - understorey planted by residents and street trees
   planted by residents- were investigated. The distribution of verge
   gardens was tested for correlation with a range of urban form and social
   factors that included the proportion of garden in residential parcels,
   the proportion of the street set aside as road verge, age of street
   development, the presence of footpaths, tree cut-outs (tree pits) and
   social disadvantage. By better understanding the factors associated with
   verge gardening, we hope planners, urban designers and land managers
   will be able to better incorporate verge gardening into urban greening
   strategies and so maximise the biodiversity, ecosystem function and
   human amenity benefits associated with this significant public activity.
   We found that verge gardening was common, occurring in almost a quarter
   (22.1\%) of verges and was strongly associated with verges without
   footpaths, tree cut-outs rather than continuous verges, and verges on
   local roads rather than collector roads. Neighbourhoods with
   proportionally more garden had more verge gardening. With the exception
   of the oldest streets in our study, streets that were newer had more
   verge gardening than those that were older. The presence of street trees
   planted by local government was associated with less verge gardening.
   Verge gardening was less common in neighbourhoods with greater social
   disadvantage, and spatial contagion increased the likelihood of
   neighbours having verge gardens. Local government can facilitate verge
   gardening through engagement, education, adopting alternative street
   types, using tree cut-outs to better strategic advantage, and targeting
   areas of social disadvantage.},

Abstract = {Private domestic gardens contribute substantially to the biodiversity of
   urban areas and benefit human health and well-being. We previously
   reported a study of 267 gardens across five cities in the United Kingdom
   in which variation in geographical and climatic factors had little
   bearing on the richness, diversity and composition of plant species. We
   therefore hypothesise that garden management is an important factor in
   determining garden characteristics. Here, from the same sample of
   gardens, we investigate potential associations between the uses to which
   people put their gardens, the types of management activities they
   undertake, and the characteristics of those gardens. Householders (n =
   265) completed a questionnaire detailing various aspects of garden use
   and management activities. The majority of respondents used their
   gardens chiefly for relaxation, recreation, and eating. Fewer than one
   fifth included ``gardening{''} amongst their garden uses even though all
   performed some garden management, suggesting that not all management
   activity resulted from an interest in gardening. Garden-watering and
   lawn-mowing were the most prevalent activities and were predictors of
   other types of management including weeding, vegetation-cutting,
   leaf-collection, and dead-heading flowers. A number of these activities
   were associated with one another, the richness and composition of plant
   species, and the number of land uses in gardens. However, relationships
   between management activities and the amount of tall vegetation were
   less consistent, and garden management appeared to be independent of
   garden area. More species of amphibians, birds, and mammals were
   observed in gardens with ponds and in which efforts were made to attract
   wildlife, particularly by providing drinking water. This study supports
   the hypothesis that garden use and management is associated with garden
   characteristics.},

Title = {Effect of Weed Management on the Parasitoid Community in Mediterranean
   Vineyards},
Journal = {BIOLOGY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Parasitoid wasps control insect pests in agricultural crops, but often
   require additional resources from non-crop plants. Vineyard growers
   sometimes address this need by planting or sowing pre-selected herbs
   around the plots or between the vine rows. Here, we explored the simpler
   strategy of conserving spontaneously growing weeds within Mediterranean
   vineyards, and trimming them mechanically when they reach large size and
   interfere with farming activities. We compared this strategy with
   matched plots, in which resident weeds were sprayed regularly with
   herbicides, representing the conventional treatment. As predicted,
   overall parasitoid abundance and the number of parasitoid species were
   higher in the weed conservation plots. However, the direction and
   magnitude of the effect differed between the dominant parasitoid
   species, and populations of some potential pests increased in the weed
   conservation treatment. Conservation of weeds that grow spontaneously in
   vineyards is a low-cost practice that offers multiple benefits, such as
   reduced soil erosion, stabilization of soil temperatures, and diminished
   exposure of farmers to agrochemicals. Our results show that communities
   of important biological control agents may gain from this practice as
   well. Nevertheless, weed conservation within vineyards can only be
   sustainable if its benefits outweigh the risks of attracting crop pests.
   Enriching agroecosystems with non-crop vegetation is a popular strategy
   for conservation biocontrol. In vineyards, the effects of specific
   seeded or planted cover crops on natural enemies are well-studied,
   whereas conserving spontaneously developing weeds received less
   attention. We compared parasitoid communities between matched pairs of
   vineyard plots in northern Israel, differing in weed management
   practices: ``herbicide{''}, repeated herbicide applications vs. ``ground
   cover{''}, maintaining resident weeds and trimming them when needed.
   Using suction sampling, we assessed the parasitoids' abundance,
   richness, and composition during three grape-growing seasons. Ground
   cover plots had greater parasitoid abundances and cumulative species
   richness than herbicide-treated plots, possibly because of their higher
   vegetation cover and richness. Dominant parasitoid species varied in
   their magnitude and direction of response to weed management. Their
   responses seem to combine tracking of host distributions with attraction
   to additional vegetation-provided resources. Parasitoid community
   composition was mildly yet significantly influenced by weed management,
   while season, year, and habitat (weeds vs. vine) had stronger effects.
   Vineyard weeds thus support local biocontrol agents and provide
   additional previously demonstrated benefits (e.g., soil conservation,
   lower agrochemical exposure) but might also attract some crop pests.
   When the benefits outweigh this risk, weed conservation seems a
   promising step towards more sustainable agricultural management.},

Abstract = {Trees in private yards are subject to a complex assortment of
   interacting ecological, social, cultural and economic factors, including
   individual preferences, social networks, multiple stakeholders and
   social constraints. This study explored residents' attitudes towards
   yard trees in China and determined the social factors shaping yard trees
   and yard tree planting. Nearly 300 questionnaires were collected
   in-person and online in urban and rural villages and communities in
   Zhoukou city, Henan. Most trees planted in yards were intentionally
   planted. Yard size was the main constraint on the number of trees in a
   yard with respondents repeatedly citing the lack of space as a deterrent
   to planting trees or planting more trees. The most popular attributes
   for trees planted in yards were symbolism and edibility. Residents'
   attitudes were based upon tree functions. The willingness and attitudes
   of residents towards yard trees suggested that an increase in yard trees
   would be supported by residents, who appeared to be yearning for a green
   living environment. However, a lack of preference found for native
   species suggests a challenging future for native trees in yards in
   regard to their role in biodiversity and habitat formation. Men played
   the dominant role in activities associated with yard trees. Residents
   were keen to aid wider ambitions for greening through their own tree
   planting in yards, but need guidance via policies and incentives. Such
   moves at high levels of government will assist the achievement of
   sustainable development goals in the future China, such as increased
   city canopy and carbon targets.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The prevention and the proper management of household food waste
   represents a dramatic and collective challenge. Home composting provides
   an excellent opportunity to recycle biowaste at source, therefore, it
   should be promoted to the public. The practice of home composting is
   influ-enced by a set of complex mechanisms, including motivation,
   attitude, and behaviour. Consumer research is needed to define segments
   of the society and to design targeted interventions. This in-vestigation
   is the first representative study analysing the habits and behaviours of
   household gar-den waste and food waste composting in Hungary. The aim
   was to explore composting practices of Hungarian households, and to
   identify the perceived advantages, barriers and incentives. The paper
   also examined the relationship between pro-environmental attitudes, food
   wastage and composting habits. The research is based on a quantitative
   (n = 1002) consumer survey repre-sentative of the adult population of
   Hungary in terms of sex, age and geographical distribution. The results
   indicate that 31\% of the respondents compost garden waste and food
   waste in the household. Lack of space and proper knowledge were defined
   as barriers. Utilization of humus and decreasing the quantity of solid
   waste are the main perceived benefits. According to the re-sults,
   pro-environmental attitude and less wasteful behaviour positively
   affects the habit of com-posting. A combined cluster analysis was
   conducted to segment the respondents. Four distinct groups have been
   identified: Average composters; Uninterested urban citizens; Helpless
   apart-ment residents; Active environmentalists. The results deliver some
   policy implications to promote home composting, especially for young
   people and families with children.},

   population density were associated with non-eusocial native bee species,
   eusocial bees (Apis mellifera and Tetragonula spp.), and hoverflies, in
   residential green spaces of the subtropical city Brisbane, Australia. We
   found that associations between bee abundance and vegetation cover were
   moderated by human density, but the direction of this effect differed
   for non-eusocial and eusocial species. Non-eusocial bee abundance was
   positively associated with tree cover at local and landscape scales when
   human densities were low, but negatively so at high human population
   densities. We suggest this may be because the quality of vegetation for
   non-eusocial bees deteriorates as human density increases. In contrast,
   abundance of eusocial bees was negatively associated with increasing
   local cover of grass and shrubs at low levels of human density, but
   positively associated at high densities. This affinity to humans could
   partly be explained by domesticated ``kept{''} hives. We found no effect
   of urban gradients on bee species richness. Hoverfly abundance was
   negatively related to human density and positively related to vegetation
   cover at local and landscape scales. At the backyard scale, both bee
   species richness and bee and hoverfly abundances were positively
   associated to flower abundance. Backyards with more vegetation cover had
   higher densities of non-eusocial bees. Our results thus support the idea
   that urban greening in densely populated areas at multiple spatial
   scales can benefit a range of insect pollinators.},

Abstract = {Urban landscapes are spatially constrained, and vegetative land uses
   that provide beneficial ecosystem services are difficult to maintain.
   Urban agricultural (UA) systems appear in many forms - from community
   farms and rooftop gardens to edible landscaping and urban orchards - and
   can be productive features of cities and provide important environmental
   services. As highly managed plant communities, UA can exhibit high
   levels of biodiversity, often exceeding that of other green space areas
   within the city. Additionally, it is likely that variation in vegetation
   cover, diversity, and structure influence not only the biodiversity in
   UA, but also the quantity and quality of ecosystem services supported by
   such systems. The biodiversity and ecosystem services (B\&ES) of UA can
   have potentially large societal and environmental benefits for cities,
   such as enhanced food security, air quality, and water regulation. Yet
   few studies have synthesized knowledge regarding UA vegetation
   management impacts on the quantity, quality, and stability of B\&ES
   provided. This article presents the first survey of the existing
   research on the characteristics of UA management and their potential to
   support ecosystem service delivery. Specifically, we examine: (1)
   biodiversity patterns in UA, (2) ecosystem services provided by UA, and
   (3) the challenges of promoting UA systems that support B\&ES. Overall,
   our review reveals that varied vegetative structure, increased native
   plant diversity, and reduction of urban impervious surface are key
   features of UA systems that contribute significantly to urban
   biodiversity and provide important ecosystem services such as
   pollination, pest control, and climate resilience. We conclude with a
   discussion of critical gaps in current research and strategies to better
   understand and support UA and ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {Introduction. Protected areas represent a huge reservoir of biological
   resources which local residents are highly dependent on. The
   non-inclusion of local knowledge is often an obstacle to conservation
   policy and sustainable use of biodiversity in these areas. The Reserve
   of Pama, located in the South-sudanian zone of Burkina Faso, is a good
   example of the discrepancy between the subsistence needs of local
   populations and the need to conserve biodiversity. Assessing the
   socio-economic importance of this reserve for local residents could lead
   to adapting a better strategy of natural resource management. Materials
   and methods. Ethnobotanical surveys were conducted based on interviews.
   The information obtained from the interrogation of 30 resource people
   identified the different uses made of the reserve by local people and
   the impact of these uses on the flora, and assessed the perception of
   villagers on the way of managing their forest resources. Results. A
   total of 58 plant species in the reserve, over 15\% of the local flora,
   provide various resources to local populations, including construction
   equipment (90\% response), medicinal plants (73.33\%), food plants
   (73.33\%), etc. The plant species most in demand were found to be, among
   others, Vitellaria paradoxa (80\%). Parkia biglobosa (66.67\%),
   Diospyros mespiliformis (33.33\%), Gardenia erubescens (33.33\%), Lannea
   microcarpa (33.33\%). Tamarindus indica (33.33\%), Anchypogon gayanus
   (26.67\%) and A. cbinensis (26.67\%). Some of these species have proved
   increasingly rare due to the deterioration of climatic conditions, abuse
   of green wood and soil depletion. Conclusion. The study we conducted on
   the reserve of Pama leads us to advocate stronger measures to protect
   the environment through the involvement of local residents. Moreover,
   the field planting of useful species in the process of depletion would
   be able to limit the operating pressure on the reserve.},

Volume = {373},

Abstract = {Many human populations are undergoing an extinction of experience, with
   a progressive decline in interactions with nature. This is a consequence
   both of a loss of opportunity for, and orientation towards, such
   experiences. The trend is of concern in part because interactions with
   nature can be good for human health and wellbeing. One potential means
   of redressing these losses is through the intentional provision of
   resources to increase wildlife populations in close proximity to people,
   thereby increasing the potential for positive human-nature experiences,
   and thence the array of benefits that can result. In this paper, we
   review the evidence that these resource subsidies have such a cascade of
   effects. In some Westernized countries, the scale of provision is
   extraordinarily high, and doubtless leads to both positive and negative
   impacts for wildlife. In turn, these impacts often lead to more
   frequent, reliable and closer human-nature interactions, with a greater
   variety of species. The consequences for human wellbeing remain poorly
   understood, although benefits documented in the context of human-nature
   interactions more broadly seem likely to apply. There are also some
   important feedback loops that need to be better characterized if
   resource provisioning is to contribute effectively towards averting the
   extinction of experience.

Abstract = {As suburban landscapes expand, it is critical to understand their
   capacity to support wildlife. Pollinators, specifically bees
   (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila), are to some degree compatible with
   urbanization and may be able to exist in suburbs in diverse assemblages.
   We surveyed 21 residential gardens for bees in Westchester County, a
   suburban area immediately north of New York City. From a sample of 1,675
   individuals, we documented 110 species, of which 95\% were native, 50\%
   were solitary, and 93\% were polylectic. In terms of abundance of
   specimens, eusocial (50\% of specimens), native (97\%), and polylectic
   (98\%) bees were dominant. Contrary to our expectation, based on
   previous bee surveys in urban landscapes, the bee community documented
   was not depauperate in either soil-nesting or parasitic species (65 and
   19\% of species, respectively), nor was it enriched in exotic species
   (6\% of species). Instead, the assemblage resembled the richer bee fauna
   documented at a 1,520-ha research preserve (forest) located in the same
   region, although certain specialist (oligolectic) and/or
   forest-associated species were absent. These results suggest that
   suburban landscapes in eastern North America have the potential to host
   relatively diverse and intact bee communities.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Road verge gardening is a civic greening practice undertaken by
   residents, which can contribute to the quantity, diversity and
   structural complexity of the greenery within the road easement. By
   understanding the social drivers of verge gardening, we can potentially
   increase biodiversity, ecosystem function and human amenity. We surveyed
   residents of single occupancy dwellings in Melbourne, Australia, and
   recorded demographic data and beliefs regarding road verge gardening. We
   used structural equation modelling to test causal models of cognitive
   constructs underlying verge gardening. We identified cultural
   background, gardening enthusiasm and level of education as significant
   factors differentiating respondents who planted verge understorey,
   planted street trees or did not verge garden. Normative beliefs were the
   main cognitive construct affecting resident behaviour, with those who
   did not verge garden more likely to think that others - and in
   particular municipal authorities - would disapprove of them verge
   gardening compared to residents who did verge garden. Sense of
   community, beliefs regarding the benefits of verge gardening, and
   feelings for nature had significant, but less direct, effects. Changing
   normative beliefs is a significant pathway to promoting verge gardening.
   Municipal authorities could reorient policy to encourage verge gardening
   and increase plantings in the verges they maintain. Planners and urban
   designers may wish to develop policy to better incorporate verge
   gardening into urban greening strategies.},

Volume = {24},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Many stressors plague bee populations including habitat fragmentation
   and degradation, as well as pathogens and pesticide exposure. With bee
   communities at risk, conservation efforts are imperative. Although
   recent research has examined bee communities across cities, few studies
   have analyzed variation in human attitudes toward and perceptions of
   bees, or how these perspectives might influence bee conservation. We
   therefore analyzed residents' attitudes toward and perceptions of bees,
   specifically in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. Primarily drawing upon
   2017 survey data (n = 496, 39\% response rate), we posed the following
   questions: 1) What cognitive, environmental, and social factors explain
   whether people like or dislike bees? and 2) How do attitudes and
   perceptions about bees relate to land management practices, specifically
   landscaping choices, herbicide and pesticide use, and desert plantings?
   Overall, attitudes toward bees were mostly neutral with a slight trend
   toward dislike but most residents did not believe bees were problematic
   at their homes. Additional findings reveal that risk perceptions,
   ecological worldviews, and pet ownership significantly explained
   attitudes toward bees. Moreover, people who live closer to desert parks
   had relatively positive attitudes toward bees. Regarding yard management
   practices, both attitudes toward and perceptions of bees were positively
   correlated with adding desert plants to residential yards. Moreover,
   people who use pesticides had more negative attitudes toward bees. Our
   results indicate conservation potential for urban bee populations, for
   example, by planting native vegetation in residential areas near desert
   preserves. We hope this study will result in more attitudinal research
   on bee species and other understudied urban wildlife.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {215},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Urbanization is occurring at a dramatic rate, driving numerous
   unfavorable environmental effects. Urban designed ecosystems have been
   used to mitigate these impacts through the provisioning of ecosystem
   services. These services may be enhanced by manipulating the plant
   community composition and structure of designed ecosystems. Here we test
   this possibility by determining the degree to which plant diversity and
   structure in ornamental gardens are related to the ecosystem service of
   pest resistance, as inferred by the taxonomic richness (at the family
   level) and abundance of arthropod pests that harm plants and arthropod
   natural enemies that feed on pests. To do so, we quantified plant
   diversity and structure and collected arthropod pests and natural
   enemies in the winter and summer from 13 ornamental gardens nested
   within four residential communities in northcentral Florida, United
   States. Pest abundance decreased exponentially as vegetation clumping
   and volume increased, but only in winter when pests were most abundant.
   Natural enemy abundance and family richness increased with the number of
   plant species present and spatial variability in plant species
   composition, again in the winter, but not summer. These relationships
   were likely driven by the direct effects of vegetation on arthropod
   habitat and not its indirect effects on temperature. Our results
   demonstrate the potential to enhance pest resistance in ornamental
   gardens by manipulating vegetation and reveal the need to expand these
   investigations into other designer ecosystems to enhance the ecosystem
   services they provide in urban landscapes.},

Abstract = {The extent and continued expansion of urbanisation has focused attention
   on the significance for native biodiversity of those green spaces

   them. In the UK, a high proportion of urban space is comprised of the
   private or domestic gardens associated with residential dwellings, and
   many recommendations have been made for simple changes to improve their
   value for biodiversity ('wildlife gardening'). Here, we report the
   results of replicated experimental tests of five such common
   recommendations, involving the introduction to gardens of (i) artificial
   nest sites for solitary bees and wasps; (ii) artificial nest sites for
   bumblebees; (iii) small ponds; (iv) dead wood for fungi and other

   butterfly larvae. The broad conclusion is that whilst some methods for
   increasing the biodiversity of garden environments may be very
   effective, others have a low probability of success on the timescales
   and spatial scales likely to be acceptable to many garden owners. If one
   of the functions of small scale biodiversity enhancement is to develop

   encouragement to conduct particular activities must be balanced with a

Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Residential yards are a form of urban land use that cover a considerable
   amount of area in cities worldwide and provide important habitat for
   wildlife, especially when landscaped with native plants. Nevertheless,
   most native-plant landscaping and wildlife research in the northern
   temperate regions of the world has been conducted during the spring and
   summer breeding period, leaving a gap in our understanding of the
   importance of residential yards and native plants as habitats for
   animals during the nonbreeding period. To fill this gap, we quantified
   the ecological role of native-landscaped yards to avifauna throughout
   Greater Los Angeles (LA), California, during the winter nonbreeding
   period, which is a time of year when the region hosts a high abundance
   and diversity of migratory and resident birds. We surveyed birds and
   habitat features from October to March of 2020 and 2021 at 22 pairs of
   native- and non-native-landscaped yards plus 10 additional
   native-landscaped yards. We had three objectives for our study. First,
   we compared avifaunal communities, including feeding and nonfeeding
   behaviors, and habitat features between native and non-native-landscaped
   yards. Second, we quantified relationships between habitat features and
   bird richness, abundance, and feeding and nonfeeding behaviors-focusing
   on species affiliated with urban or natural terrestrial ecosystems of
   the region. Third, we documented feeding and nonfeeding behaviors by
   birds with native and non-native plants. Native-landscaped yards had a
   greater cover of native trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, and a
   higher cover of natural habitat elements, including leaf litter and
   bare-ground cover. Bird richness and abundance-especially bird species
   affiliated with tree- and shrub-dominated cosystems-were greater in
   native than non-native-landscaped yards. Further, yards with a higher
   cover of native plants supported greater numbers of feeding birds, with
   individuals focusing their foraging behaviors on distinct native trees
   and shrubs, including Quercus spp. (oak), Heteromeles spp. (toyon),
   Arctostaphylos spp. (manzanita), and Salvia spp. (sage). Our results
   suggest that residential yards landscaped with native plants provide
   important habitat for birds during the nonbreeding period and are a
   viable approach for residents and cities if improving conditions for
   birds throughout the annual cycle is a goal.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary: Moles are burrowing mammals that are regarded as pests
   in Britain, and until 2006 they could legally be killed using strychnine
   poison. When strychnine was withdrawn there were fears that mole
   populations would increase. We surveyed farmers, amenity managers and
   householders about moles and mole control on their land in 2007, post
   strychnine withdrawal. Kill-trapping was by far the preferred control
   method used and control may be used more than can be justified by damage
   levels or the effect of control on damage. Mole traps are unregulated,
   unlike most other spring traps, and some might not meet current welfare
   standards. We found no evidence that mole activity had increased since a

   Abstract: Moles are considered pests in Britain, but this issue has been
   little studied. Lower welfare standards have been tolerated for moles
   than for most other managed wild mammal species, as use of both the
   controversial poison, strychnine, and unregulated traps have been
   permitted. Strychnine was withdrawn in 2006 and there were fears that
   mole populations would increase as a result. In 2007, we conducted a
   comprehensive, nationwide survey of land manager perceptions, opinions
   and behaviour regarding moles and mole control on farms, amenities and
   domestic gardens in Britain. We surveyed 2150 land managers (achieving a
   59\% response rate) and ground-truthed 29 responses. Moles were reported
   to be present on most farms and amenities, and 13\% of gardens, and were
   more common in lighter soils. Where present, moles were usually
   considered pests, this being more likely in Wales, Scotland and northern
   England, on livestock and mixed farms, and on large, high-value
   amenities, e.g., racecourses and golf courses. Mole control followed
   similar patterns to mole presence. More control may occur than is
   economically, and therefore potentially ethically, justified. Control
   should be more carefully considered and, where necessary, more
   effectively targeted. Kill-trapping was the favoured recent and future
   method on farms and amenities, even if strychnine was to be
   reintroduced; however, because mole traps are currently unregulated,
   some might not meet current welfare standards if tested. We found no
   evidence for an increase in moles since a farm questionnaire survey
   conducted in 1992; this could have wider implications for future
   wildlife management policy changes.},

Abstract = {As urbanization accelerates worldwide, municipalities are attempting to
   construct new green spaces within their borders. The perceived
   ecological value of these places is frequently tied to their ability to
   attract urban wildlife, such as birds, which can easily be observed and
   enjoyed. As one strategy, stormwater is now frequently managed with
   green infrastructure: planted areas that retain and treat stormwater
   rather than merely directing it to surface waters. While these practices
   have the potential to provide habitat for urban wildlife, the ecological
   effects of these systems are largely unknown. To assess whether one
   green infrastructure project increases habitat value, we used passive
   acoustic monitoring to survey urban bird communities in and near a large
   green infrastructure project in Columbus, Ohio (USA). Bird communities
   near bioretention cells (rain gardens) were compared to those at nearby
   lawns and remnant or restored natural areas. We found that recently
   installed bioretention cells tended to support more omnivores,
   lower-canopy foraging species, and species from a higher diversity of
   feeding guilds than did nearby lawn control sites. We were unable to
   detect effects of nearby bioretention installations on bird species
   richness at other sites. The observed differences in species richness
   were fairly small, and we urge caution when anticipating the habitat
   value of bioretention cells, at least for bird species. However, the
   results that we observed suggest that bioretention cells could have a
   more positive impact on bird communities in different contexts or using
   different design strategies. The bioretention cells surveyed in this
   study were small and only planted in grasses and forbs, potentially
   limiting their ability to offer complex habitat. They were also
   relatively young, and future work is needed to determine their long-term
   effect on avian communities and biodiversity of other taxa.},

Title = {Retrofitting streetlights with LEDs has limited impacts on urban

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {254},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Artificial light at night (ALAN) causes a wide range of ecological
   impacts across diverse ecosystems. Most concentrated in urban areas,
   ALAN poses a particular risk to associated wildlife by disrupting
   physiology, behaviour and ultimately survival. This risk is predicted to
   shift as nighttime lightscapes in many cities undergo change. Globally,
   streetlights are currently being retrofitted with newer technologies
   that differ in the spectrum and intensity of their emissions, but there
   is a dearth of in situ urban experiments on the ecological impacts of
   this change. We monitored timing of dawn and dusk bird song; frequency
   of owl vocalisations; avian diversity, relative abundance and community
   composition; small invasive mammal and ground insect activity; and
   invertebrate relative abundance at 26 residential properties over an
   18-month period that coincided with a retrofit from high-pressure sodium
   (HPS) to white light-emitting diode (LED) streetlights. Initiation time
   of dawn song was advanced or delayed for two bird species following the
   retrofit and backyard avian community composition was altered. Avian
   species richness, relative abundances of three bird species and ground
   insect activity increased in the presence of LED streetlights. No other
   retrofit effects were found. Our study suggests that retrofitting
   streetlights with white LEDs may lead to both positive and negative
   conservation outcomes for urban wildlife, but direct impacts are
   relatively small and may be mitigated by changes in lighting
   characteristics, such as dimming. Streetlight retrofits could provide an
   opportunity to reduce the impacts of ALAN on urban wildlife if
   intentionally designed with conservation benefits in mind.},

Abstract = {Despite decades of effort, biodiversity has not attracted effective
   political discourse, policies, or action to halt its decline. In cities
   in particular, biodiversity conservation is challenged by short-term
   approaches, separately focusing on biodiversity or community well-being
   rather than on their interconnection, and pervasive beliefs that urban
   citizenry lack the requisite ethic or skills for conservation action or
   biodiversity governance. We describe how a systemic co-inquiry in
   Victoria Australia, conducted by citizen and agency practitioners
   alongside policy developers and academic researchers, modified
   understandings, practices, and institutional arrangements (governance)
   for urban biodiversity conservation. The most impactful outcomes of the
   early co-inquiry period were (1) start-up funding for a network to forge
   collaborations between community and local government actors that engage
   urban residents in supporting indigenous biodiversity in their gardens,
   and (2) empowered co-inquiry members driving the network's development.
   These efforts have led to on-going social learning and long-term
   institutional arrangements for a burgeoning network of municipally based
   nature stewardship collaborations that are nurturing local human-nature
   relations. Key challenges include(d): maintaining the co-inquiry,
   paradigms that undervalue urban biodiversity and the role of citizens,
   organizational inertia, and evaluation measures incommensurate with
   strengthening person-nature relationships. Our research shows how
   systemic co-inquiry involving citizen practitioners can surface
   misleading assumptions around biodiversity stewardship and governance,
   and help to empower citizen and agency actors to focus on nurturing
   sustainable human-nature relations in cities.},

Abstract = {Individual residents in the United States increasingly practice
   do-it-yourself pest management in their lawns and gardens.This
   self-managed pest control is frequently characterized by unnecessary and
   sometimes indiscriminate applications of pesticide that are often
   ineffective and environmentally damaging. Given residential consumers
   account for most of the world's pesticide expenditures, the need to
   increase adoption of IPM best practices is critical.Through its
   education and technical training programming, we argue that Cooperative
   Extension is uniquely positioned to nudge residential DIY pest
   management away from an exclusive reliance on pesticide application and
   towards IPM best practices. To assess how best to encourage an increase
   in IPM adoption, we examined the relationship between an individual
   user's knowledge of IPM practices and adoption of IPM behavior. Survey
   results from individual residents responsible for their lawn and garden
   management indicate that where there is high knowledge of IPM best
   practices, there appears to be a strong likelihood of behavior adoption.
   Results also show, however, that a significant number of respondents
   have little to no knowledge of IPM.To address this gap, we argue for the
   need to increase IPM-related education and provide recommendations for
   future research.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {290},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Humans have shaped the environment through landscape transformation,
   disturbance, and resource exploitation, leading to major habitat
   modification and fragmentation. Mammal species are massively threatened
   by these changes and their diversity implies various responses to human
   disturbance. It is essential to understand the conditions for their
   persistence in human-dominated landscapes, and the drivers of
   humans-mammals' coexis- tence to apply relevant conservation measures.
   The Garden Route Biosphere Reserve, in South Africa, a mosaic landscapes
   where human activities and wildlife meet, is an ideal site to examine
   how anthropogenic attributes influence wildlife occurrence. To maximise
   our area coverage through a replicable, low-cost protocol, we designed
   an online survey aimed at residents to investigate the effect of
   landscape metrics and property attributes - the availability and type of
   anthropogenic resources, the integrity and type of natural habitats,
   structural disturbances and interferences - on the persistence of
   mammals in such environments. We collected data from 247 respondents and
   modelled the drivers of occurrence for 14 mammal species (>500 g). We
   found speciesspecific responses to synthetic variables describing
   anthropogenic features in the studied landscape and used the
   anthropodependence framework to categorise species profiles. We showed
   that human disturbance combined with the availability of anthropogenic
   resources and natural habitats defined various categories of species
   profiles, which should require differential conservation actions. Local
   ecological knowledge proved promising to understand conditions for
   mammal persistence in human-dominated landscapes. This method also
   allowed researchers to engage with a wide variety of stakeholders, thus
   creating a hub for knowledge exchange.},

Abstract = {Greenspaces are increasingly valued for supporting biodiversity in
   urbanized landscapes. Previous research efforts have emphasized the
   importance of public land such as parks and nature preserves for
   biodiversity, yet private yards in residential neighborhoods also have
   great potential for species conservation. Our study considered the
   importance of adjacent public and private greenspaces for urban bird
   diversity. We surveyed birds in public parks (n = 39) and private yards
   (n = 41) distributed across neighboring twin cities (Champaign and
   Urbana) in Illinois, USA, to assess potential differences in bird
   diversity across: (1) the public-private divide; (2) seasons (winter vs.
   summer); and (3) the two cities. We found a seasonal interaction across
   the public-private divide. In summer, communities in private yards were
   a subset of those found in public parks, whereas in winter, both private
   yards and public parks hosted equally diverse yet distinct species
   assemblages. Between the two cities, Urbana supported greater bird
   diversity and a distinct species assemblage compared to the warmer, more
   urbanized city of Champaign. Our results demonstrate that both public
   parks and private yards play key roles in supporting native bird
   diversity, but also highlight that these roles can shift across seasons.
   Furthermore, we show that neighboring cities within the same conurbation
   can differ substantially in bird community structure and diversity. Our
   findings reinforce the importance of maintaining heterogeneous landscape
   mosaics and combining land sparing and land sharing approaches to
   maximize bird diversity in urban areas.},

Abstract = {Up to 70\% of residential water use goes to maintaining landscape

   preferences and choices of individual homeowners provides a crucial
   opportunity for water conservation. Using three demonstration landscapes
   varying in water conservation best management practices (BMPs), we
   surveyed attendees of a University of California Cooperative Extension
   educational event to determine preferences for the demonstration
   landscapes according to aesthetics as well as other preference criteria.
   The survey examined aesthetic preferences for BMPs at both the whole
   landscape level and the landscape component (turf, paving, non-turf
   vegetation) level whereas other preference criteria were examined only
   at the whole landscape level. Preference for the landscape with an
   intermediate amount of BMPs was the highest at the whole landscape level
   for nearly all criteria. Surprisingly, at the component level,
   homeowners exhibited preference for the more water conserving
   components. This indicates that BMPs are aesthetically appealing
   individually but when BMPs exist for every component in the landscape,
   the landscape is less preferred. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Context Tree canopy connectivity is important for supporting
   biodiversity. In urban landscapes, empirical examinations of habitat
   connectivity often overlook residential land, though yards and gardens
   often comprise a large portion of urban forests. Objectives We quantify
   structural composition (patches and paths), connectivity and
   fragmentation of an entire tree canopy network spanning 1220 Boston's
   neighborhoods to assess the configuration of the urban forest
   potentially affecting tree-dependent wildlife species, such as some
   birds and arboreal mammals. Methods The urban landscape was classified
   by land use, and residential yards were further subdivided into front
   yards, backyards, and corner yards. Structural composition, connectivity
   and fragmentation of the tree canopy was assessed using morphological
   spatial pattern and network analysis. Canopy metrics were then related
   to the land use of 349,305 property parcels. Results Back yard tree
   canopy cover was 65.23\%. The majority of canopy links were on
   residential land (60.95\% total), and particularly in backyards. Back
   yards contained the highest number of canopy fragments (48.65\% total).
   Fragmentation of the canopy network peaked at similar to 23\% of total
   canopy cover. Canopy fragmentation, distance among patches and their
   shape complexity were lower in neighborhoods with more tree canopy.
   Conclusions The important role that yards have in sustaining canopy
   connectivity across urban landscapes poses challenges and opportunities.
   Urban land management and planning need to protect connectivity links
   within urban forests when located on private residential realm. A
   prioritization strategy aimed at expanding urban tree cover could focus
   on yards to ensure that urban landscape connectivity is maintained and
   increased.},

Abstract = {Traditional methods of assessing human-animal interactions include
   questionnaires or targeted interviews. More people typically use the
   internet as their primary source of information and now the availability
   and ease of collecting data from internet search terms mean that
   patterns of human-animal interactions can be assessed. In this study,
   internet search data of human-red fox interactions were analyzed for
   annual and monthly patterns. In general, patterns of internet searches
   were highest during April-August, reflecting key events for foxes such
   as denning and cub rearing. Increased searches for human-fox conflict
   solutions during this same period may also reflect changes in human
   behavior (e.g., increased garden usage). Annual increases in some search
   terms suggested an increasing awareness of foxes and problems with the
   species. This study shows that internet searches can show clear seasonal
   patterns that are associated with important periods of species biology.},

Abstract = {Understanding public attitudes towards the environment and factors
   influencing it is very important in predicting pro-environmental
   behaviour of citizens. However, in many cities in sub-Saharan Africa,
   where rapid urbanisation has come with diverse environmental
   sustainability challenges, there are very few studies that provide
   insight into the attitude of citizens towards urban green infrastructure
   (UGI) and the factors influencing it. This study investigated residents'
   attitude towards UGI and the factors influencing it in Lagos Metropolis,
   Nigeria. The data were collected through a questionnaire survey of 1560
   participants and physical observations in selected neighbourhoods in the
   study area. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics,
   multiple regression and content analyses. It was observed that the most
   common UGI in the study area were parks, gardens, grasses, sport fields
   and street trees and that around 67\% of the participants demonstrated
   good attitude towards UGI in their respective neighbourhoods. In
   addition, around 47\% of the variance inR(2)was explained by the
   regression model with residents' perceived role of UGI in fostering
   social cohesion and health benefits and quality of neighbourhood UGI
   emerging as the top three factors that influenced residents' attitude
   towards green infrastructure. This study implies that adequate knowledge
   of the social and health benefits and quality of GI are vital to
   developing positive attitudes towards GI among urban population.},

Abstract = {Land management can occur at very small scales, such as in individual
   home gardens, and at very large scales, such as at the municipal scale
   or beyond. The scale of management can affect environmental
   heterogeneity and thus can affect biodiversity at alpha, beta, and gamma
   scales. Urban areas provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects
   of large- versus small-scale land management on different scales of
   biodiversity. We surveyed floral resources and bees in residential
   backyards and powerline corridors in the Chicago suburbs, with yards
   representing small-scale management and powerline corridors representing
   large-scale management. We calculated alpha diversity, beta diversity,
   and gamma diversity for both floral and bee species. We also determined
   absolute nestedness for corridors and neighborhoods to gain further
   insight into effects of management on species composition. We found that
   beta diversity for both floral resources and bees was highest in
   response to small-scale yard management and its creation of
   heterogeneous landscapes, while alpha and gamma diversity patterns were
   less clear. We also found that the floral resource and bee communities
   demonstrated absolute nestedness in both powerline corridors and
   residential neighborhoods, respectively. Our results indicate that taxa
   may respond to the effects of management scale differently owing to
   variation in their mobility or resource requirements. Our study results
   demonstrate that suburban residential areas may be prime targets for
   biodiversity conservation due to their environmental heterogeneity.},

   Study of Wuhan, China},
Journal = {FORESTS},

Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {More and more urban residents in China have suffered from food
   insecurity and failed to meet the national recommendation of daily fruit
   and vegetable consumption due to rapid urbanization in recent years.
   Introducing edible landscapes to urban greening systems represents an
   opportunity for improving urban food supply and security. However,
   residents' opinion on urban edible landscapes has rarely been discussed.
   In this study, questionnaire surveys were performed in eight sample
   communities in Wuhan, China, to collect the information on residents'
   attention and awareness of urban edible landscapes. Results indicated
   that nearly one-third of the respondents were unaware of edible
   landscapes before the interview. Most residents thought that an edible
   landscape could promote efficient land use (57.26\%) and express special
   ornamental effects (54.64\%), but quite a few didn't believe that
   growing edible plants in urban public spaces could increase food output
   (37.10\%) and improve food quality (40.12\%). Overall, 45.65\% and
   32.73\% of the growers performed their cultivation behavior in private
   and semiprivate spaces, respectively. Lack of public areas for
   agriculture use was regarded as the main barrier restricting the
   development of urban horticulture by 55.86\% of growers and 59.51\% of
   non-growers. The residents were also worried about their property
   manager's opposition, possible conflicts, and complex relationships with
   their neighbors. Food policies and infrastructure support from local
   governments and official institutions were needed to ensure the
   successful implementation of edible landscapes in urban areas.},

Title = {Public perception towards river and water conservation practices:
   Opportunities for implementing urban stormwater management practices},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {223},
Pages = {478-488},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The effectiveness of urban stormwater management practices (SMPs) on
   local water quality is dependent on adoption rates reaching a critical
   mass. While numerous studies have measured the effectiveness of
   practices on controlling water quantity and improving water quality, few
   have focused on the perspective of the public. The purpose of this study
   was to identify individuals' perceptions of urban SMPs implementation in
   the public and private realms, and how longitudinal perceptions about
   the local river could inform future water resource management. Through
   the lens of environmental behavior theories, we performed statistical
   analyses on four surveys - 2006, 2009, 2014 and 2016 - administered to
   urban residents in the Wabash River watershed in Tippecanoe County,
   Indiana. Our findings show that residents' water quality awareness and
   sense of personal responsibility increase over the ten years studied. In
   particular, rain garden adopters have higher appreciation of the Wabash
   River and care about how the river functions than other SMP adopters and
   non-adopters. In terms of urban SMP adoption, results indicate that
   residents are supportive of integrating rain barrels and rain gardens
   into public spaces. Perceptions of SMP benefits related to functional
   benefits, rather than environmental benefits, are prevalent when
   considering implementing SMPs on personal property. In addition,
   respondents support reducing stormwater charges for adopters of such
   practices on private property. Although cognitive barriers exist in
   those who have yet to adopt the practices, including concerns about SMP
   effectiveness, maintenance, aesthetics, and risk of bugs and insects,
   adopters are less likely to perceive such barriers. This research
   suggests that making resources (i.e., skills, knowledge, equipment,
   funding) more accessible to the public is essential, but not sufficient
   to encourage pro-environmental behaviors. Promoting public involvement
   in watershed activities, increasing their awareness about how urban SMPs
   function, and emphasizing the functional benefits of practices can be
   effective in motivating adoption.},

Abstract = {Understanding the factors that influence biodiversity in urban areas is
   important for informing management efforts aimed at enhancing the
   ecosystem services in urban settings and curbing the spread of invasive
   introduced species. We determined the ecological and socioeconomic
   factors that influence patterns of plant richness, phylogenetic
   diversity, and composition in 133 private household yards in the
   Minneapolis-Saint Paul Metropolitan area, Minnesota, USA. We compared
   the composition of spontaneously occurring plant species and those
   planted by homeowners with composition in natural areas (at the Cedar
   Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve) and in the horticulture pool of species
   available from commercial growers. Yard area and fertilizer frequency
   influenced species richness of the spontaneous species but expressed
   homeowner values did not. In contrast, the criteria that homeowners
   articulated as important in their management decisions, including
   aesthetics, wildlife, neatness and food provision, significantly
   predicted cultivated species richness. Strikingly, the composition of
   plant species that people cultivated in their yards resembled the
   taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of species available
   commercially. In contrast, the taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of
   spontaneous species showed high similarity to natural areas. The large
   fraction of introduced species that homeowners planted was a likely
   consequence of what was available for them to purchase. The study links
   the composition and diversity of yard flora to their natural and
   anthropogenic sources and sheds light on the human factors and values
   that influence the plant diversity in residential areas of a major urban
   system. Enhanced understanding of the influences of the sources of
   plants, both native and introduced, that enter urban systems and the
   human factors and values that influence their diversity is critical to
   identifying the levers to manage urban biodiversity and ecosystem

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Urban green spaces provide many benefits, including to human wellbeing,
   ecosystem services, and urban wildlife. Thus, there are many reasons to
   green up urban spaces, especially by using native species. Furthermore,
   urban green spaces are suited to enhancing biodiversity without
   negatively impacting food or fiber production. Municipalities and
   private landowners invest substantially in landscaping and its
   maintenance. However, much of that outlay supports non-native plants
   that may be less adapted to local conditions such as rainfall patterns
   and temperature ranges, thus having greater resource requirements, as
   well as being less supportive of native wildlife and possessing a
   greater potential of becoming invasive. Here, we explore ways to
   increase the use of native plant species in urban settings to reduce the
   need for watering or chemical application, enhance the support of native
   species, and reduce the risk of invasion to urban and ex-urban habitats.
   We identify three main impediments: the perception of native species as
   less aesthetically pleasing, the availability of native plants in the
   nursery industry, and the willingness of policymakers to take supportive
   measures. We propose methods to address all three, providing successful
   examples from a number of US localities and a case study that
   demonstrates what drivers might exist and what actions remain to be
   taken.},

Abstract = {Residential yards are a unique component of the urban environment and
   harbor high cultivated plant biodiversity; however, why and how people
   create yards with so many plant species is not well understood. To
   investigate this pattern, we studied the relationships between
   residents' preferences, income, and yard plant biodiversity in the Salt
   Lake Valley, Utah, USA where most of the urban vegetation is
   intentionally cultivated. We conducted in-person interviews, distributed
   written surveys, and inventoried the biodiversity (i.e., genus and
   species richness) of ornamental herbaceous flowering plants and lawn
   plants in residential yards located in neighborhoods across income
   levels. We found that 95\% of surveyed residents valued having `plants
   that create variety in the yard' ('variety' left open to interpretation)
   and that 47\% of interviewed residents expressed an emotional connection
   to variety. On average, general plant variety was more important to
   residents than high plant biodiversity (i.e., a specified type of
   variety), but they also exhibited a preference for neat monoculture
   lawns lacking in biodiversity and other types of variety. Residents'
   preferences for general plant variety, and biodiversity specifically,
   were not necessarily reflected in their yards. Higher income households
   had greater flowering plant variety in terms of number of different
   flower colors, inflorescence types, and genera, but lower lawn species
   biodiversity due to a reduction in weedy species. Overall, our study
   shows that most residents in this region prefer plant variety in their
   yards more than biodiversity specifically, and that people with higher
   incomes can better achieve these preferences.},

Title = {Urban native vegetation remnants support more diverse native bee
   communities than residential gardens in Australia's southwest
   biodiversity hotspot},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {265},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Native bees are declining in many regions, often associated with loss of
   natural habitat. Urbanisation replaces natural vegetation with a
   highly-modified landscape, where residential gardens are a major
   component of urban greenspace. While many cities retain native
   vegetation remnants within the urban matrix, these are often small,
   isolated and degraded. However, there is little empirical evidence on
   the capacity of residential gardens to provide equivalent or beneficial
   habitat for native bees, and which local and landscape factors influence
   bee assemblages. We surveyed bee assemblages in the southwest Australian
   biodiversity hotspot at seven residential gardens and seven bushland
   remnants over two years. We recorded 153 species/morphospecies of native
   bees. Native bees were more abundant in bushland remnants than
   residential gardens. Abundance of the introduced honeybee Apis mellifera
   was generally high, and did not differ between habitats. Bushland
   remnants hosted more species, and rare and unique species, than did
   residential gardens. Native bee body-size and nesting guilds varied in
   their response to habitat type. Native bee abundance and richness
   increased with abundance of native plant species, but decreased with
   total flower species richness. Native bee species richness was
   negatively impacted by urbanisation (built space and isolation from
   bushland reserves). There were no significant relationships between
   honeybee abundance and local and landscape factors. Our study
   demonstrates that while residential gardens can host native bees, urban
   bushland remnants harbour a more comprehensive suite of species and are
   key for the conservation of native bee populations.},

Abstract = {Home food gardening is an important component of urban agriculture and

   and pests, mobility, support and access, and community. Barriers vary
   depending on individual circumstances and are often compounding. Our
   results indicate that while many households are now growing food, or are
   interested in growing food, there are limitations on the percentage of
   food intake that households can grow at home. Key factors to growing
   more food include control over property, available land, and gardening
   experience and know-how. Our findings highlight the need for policy,
   programs, and resources, especially at the level of local governments,

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {213},
Number = {A},
Pages = {42-50},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Understanding how introduced plants reduce food web complexity is
   critical to effective conservation management within human-dominated
   systems. In urban breeding birds, the paucity of dietary specialists
   suggests that a lack of food resources, such as arthropod prey essential
   for reproduction and survival, may contribute to bird declines. Local
   plant species composition and abundance is influenced by the landscaping
   decisions of private homeowners and may be contributing to differences
   in insect prey availability. In this study, we examined whether
   non-native plants are a limiting factor to a resident breeding
   insectivore, the Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). We used
   caterpillar counts, chickadee foraging observations and
   detection-corrected hierarchical models, to determine the influence of
   local landscaping features on insect food availability, chickadee tree
   preference, site occupancy, site abundance and breeding territory
   selection. Native plants were more likely to host a higher biomass of
   caterpillars compared to non-native plants, and chickadees strongly
   preferred to forage in native plants that supported the most
   caterpillars. In addition, chickadees were less likely to breed in yards
   as the dominance of non-native plants increased. Chickadee occupancy
   increased with tree basal area and chickadee abundance declined as
   impermeable surface area increased and basal area decreased. Our results
   demonstrate that non-native plants reduce habitat suitability for
   chickadees by reducing insect food available for breeding. Improving
   human-dominated landscapes as wildlife habitat should include increasing
   native, and arthropod-producing, plant species to effectively support
   the life history needs of insectivorous birds.},

Abstract = {Cities are increasingly recognised as important sites for biodiversity
   and essential for improving human-nature connections. However, urban
   areas are also hotspots for rats, which negatively impact biodiversity
   due to competition and depredation. Urban residents may undertake rat
   control on their properties, but the effectiveness of such volunteer
   initiatives for broader biodiversity outcomes has not been tested in
   urban environments. We conducted a comprehensive study inclusive of rat
   abundance, adult bird diversity, and bird breeding success. We monitored
   rat (Norway rat Rattus norvegicus; ship rat Rattus rattus) presence and
   modelled detection probabilities and occupancy in suburban residential
   backyards in Auckland, New Zealand. We also compared bird abundance and
   richness among backyards and recorded 140 nesting attempts from 15 bird
   species between September 2021 and February 2022. Despite rat control,
   rats were detected at some point in all backyards, though relative
   abundance was low, and fewer rats were detected in backyards with more
   frequent rat control. Higher bird abundance, and to a lesser extent
   richness, were associated with proximity to native vegetation patches
   and more frequent rat control. Overall fledging success was relatively
   high and predation by rats was relatively low compared to previous
   research. Nest survival was slightly higher for introduced bird species.
   Daily nest survival rate increased with nest height, proximity to native
   vegetation patches, and when rat detection rates decreased. Although the
   effect was small, frequent rat control within a backyard was associated
   with increased fledging success and increased bird species richness and
   abundance. Further research is required to explore the factors that
   interact with backyard rat control to improve local outcomes for birds.
   High levels of community participation in backyard rat control are
   required to improve neighbourhood-wide outcomes for birds.},

Abstract = {1Urban areas are predicted to grow significantly in the foreseeable
   future because of increasing human population growth. Predicting the
   impact of urban development and expansion on mammal populations is of
   considerable interest due to possible effects on biodiversity and
   human-wildlife conflict.
   2The British government has recently announced a substantial housing
   programme to meet the demands of its growing population and changing
   socio-economic profile. This is likely to result in the construction of
   high-density, low-cost housing with small residential gardens. To assess
   the potential effects of this programme, we analysed the factors
   affecting the current pattern of use of residential gardens by a range
   of mammal species using a questionnaire distributed in wildlife and
   gardening magazines and via The Mammal Society.
   3Twenty-two species/species groups were recorded. However, the pattern
   of garden use by individual species was limited, with only six
   species/species groups (bats, red fox Vulpes vulpes, grey squirrel
   Sciurus carolinensis, hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus, mice, voles)
   recorded as frequent visitors to > 20\% of gardens in the survey.
   4There was a high degree of association between the variables recorded
   in the study, such that it was difficult to quantify the effects of
   individual variables. However, all species/species groups appeared to be
   negatively affected by the increased fragmentation and reduced proximity
   of natural and semi-natural habitats, decreasing garden size and garden
   structure, but to differing degrees. Patterns of garden use were most
   clearly affected by house location (city, town, village, rural), with
   garden use declining with increasing urbanization for the majority of
   species/species groups, except red foxes and grey squirrels. Increasing
   urbanization is likely to be related to a wide range of interrelated
   factors, any or all of which may affect a range of mammal species.
   5Overall, the probable effects of the planned housing development
   programme in Britain are not likely to be beneficial to mammal
   populations, although the pattern of use examined in this study may
   represent patterns of habitat selection by species rather than
   differences in distribution or abundance. Consequently, additional data
   are required on the factors affecting the density of species within
   urban environments.},

Journal = {INSECTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Simple Summary The protection of pollinating insects depends on public
   support. Citizen science (CS) is frequently discussed as a way to
   promote interest and conservation action for pollinators. In cities, the
   drivers behind pollinator-friendly behaviour are largely unclear. We
   surveyed 111 community gardeners in Berlin and Munich, Germany, some of
   which were participating in a citizen science project. We created four
   different sets of generalized linear models to analyse how the
   gardeners' pro-pollinator behaviour intentions and behaviour were
   explained by the gardener's identity, emotions towards pollinators,
   attitudes towards pollinators and nature-relatedness. Respondents who
   were fascinated by pollinators, held positive attitudes, and felt joy
   about seeing pollinators reported intentions to protect or support
   pollinators. Similarly, joy about seeing pollinators was a predictor of
   participation in the CS project. We believe that CS may represent a
   pathway through which urban residents may become key actors in
   conservation projects within their nearby greenspaces. The conservation
   of pollinators requires social understanding to catalyse restoration
   action. Citizen science (CS) is discussed as a way to promote interest
   and action for pollinating insects. Yet, the drivers behind
   pro-pollinator behaviour are largely unclear, especially in urban areas.
   To better understand public engagement in pollinator conservation, we
   studied urban community gardeners' identity, nature-relatedness,
   emotions, and attitudes toward pollinators and their intentions to get
   involved in pro-pollinator behaviour in their gardening practice. We
   surveyed community gardeners in Berlin and Munich, Germany, some of
   which were participating in a citizen science project. In this
   scientific study, we created four different sets of generalized linear
   models to analyse how the gardeners' pro-pollinator behaviour intentions
   and behaviour were explained by socio-psychological factors. The
   responses of 111 gardeners revealed that gardeners that were fascinated
   by pollinators, held positive attitudes and felt joy about seeing
   pollinators reported intentions to protect or support pollinators,
   suggesting that fascination and joy can be harnessed for research and
   conservation on pollinators. Similarly, joy about seeing pollinators
   predicted participation in the CS project. We believe that CS may
   represent a pathway through which urban residents may become key actors
   in conservation projects within their nearby greenspaces.},

Volume = {27},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In urban and suburban areas, wildlife and people are often in close
   quarters, leading to human-wildlife interactions (HWI). Understanding
   how wildlife interacts with humans and the built environment is critical
   as urbanization contributes to habitat change and fragmentation
   globally. The environmental drivers that influence HWIs are largely
   unknown in some systems, however, especially across multiple spatial
   scales. Using location and species data from a business that relocates
   snakes across the Phoenix metropolitan area (Arizona, USA), we found the
   most frequently removed were venomous (family Viperidae, e.g.,
   rattlesnakes). Nonvenomous snakes were also removed (family Colubridae,
   e.g., gophersnakes). Using these records, we investigated taxa-specific
   habitat relationships at two spatial scales. The neighborhood scale
   focused on front yard measures of cover and vegetation classes, and the
   landscape scale focused on remote-sensed variables related to vegetation
   indices and degree of urbanization. Both analyses compared areas where
   snakes were removed to random locations in the city to evaluate used and
   available locations of snakes. At the neighborhood scale, snake removals
   (n = 59) occurred in yards with abundant vegetation and debris cover
   opportunities compared to random locations. At the landscape scale,
   snake removal locations (n = 764) had taxa-specific differences, with
   nonvenomous snakes removed from areas of higher urbanization than
   venomous snakes, a pattern was likely related to differences in life
   history and behavior. Environmental variables associated with HWI can
   vary across different spatial scales. Understanding these environmental
   characteristics associated with snake removals from residential can
   focus management activities to reduce potential human-snake conflict.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {220},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Increased urbanization drives habitat loss, yet residential land-use
   represents significant habitat potential for mammals and could provide
   connectivity between patches of green spaces. Diverse mammal communities
   exist across urban gradients, but it is unclear how mammal community
   composition varies within residential lands. We conducted a camera
   trapping study in 36 residential yards across an urban gradient to
   assess the relative contributions of the degree of urbanization in the
   land-use context versus parcel habitat features, such as vegetation
   structure, on mammal community diversity and composition. We
   hypothesized that land-use context would more strongly influence mammal
   community metrics than parcel features, and that there would be
   species-specific differences in response. We detected 14
   non-domesticated mammal species and found that species richness peaked
   in the suburbs and tapered off at the rural and urban ends of the
   gradient in accordance with patterns seen in other taxonomic groups, yet
   rarely quantified in mammals. Large-bodied interior forest species were
   associated with rural sites, urban-dwelling species were associated with
   urban sites, and suburban sites had an overlap of species types.
   Although composition of mammal species in residential yards appears to
   be strongly related to land-use context, which is often outside of
   residents' control, management of parcel habitat features such as
   retention of large mature trees may facilitate connectivity between
   patches of habitat across urbanizing landscapes. Informed residential
   yard management remains an important tool for urban wildlife management
   in an era of global change.},

   should form part of this broader conversation on gardens for birds and
   biodiversity, with a specific aim of drawing attention to species that
   are at risk of localised extinctions in modern urban landscapes - urban
   adaptors. We present our commentary in two themes: (a) mitigating
   threats to birds in the urban environment and (b) enhancing the habitat
   value of the urban environment for a broader range of bird species. We
   provide a synthesis of the research of recent years that has explored
   the urban environment and its ability to support birds, but importantly,
   we extend on this by bringing together topics that have been somewhat
   lacking in the discussion to date. In a new approach to this

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Urbanisation is a prominent and increasing form of land-use change, with
   the potential to disrupt the interactions between pollinators such as
   bees and the flowering plants that they visit. This in turn may cause
   cascading local extinctions and have consequences for pollination
   services. Network approaches go beyond simple metrics of abundance and
   species richness, enabling understanding of how the structure of
   plant-pollinator communities are affected by urbanisation. Here we
   compared pollination networks between native vegetation (bushland)
   remnants and residential gardens in the urbanised region of the
   southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot. Across fourteen sites, seven
   per habitat, plant-bee visitor networks were created from surveys
   conducted monthly during the spring-summer period over two years.
   Extinction slope (a measure of how extinctions cascade through the
   network), and network robustness and nestedness were higher for bushland
   remnants, suggesting that networks in bushland remnants had greater
   functional integrity, but if disrupted, more cascading extinctions could
   occur. In contrast, niche overlap between pollinators was higher in
   residential gardens, suggesting greater competition for resources. Most
   species-level properties did not differ between habitats, except for
   normalised degree, which was higher in bushland remnants. In conclusion,
   it appears that pollination networks in managed residential gardens are
   not structurally equivalent with those in bushland remnants. This has
   implications for conservation of wild bee assemblages in this
   biodiversity hotspot, and suggests removal of remnant native vegetation
   for residential development could disrupt the integrity of
   plant-pollinator assemblages.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic emerged as a global public health
   threat. In this crisis period, urban parks provided multiple ecosystem
   services and direct/indirect benefits to mental and physical health.
   However, the use patterns, attitudes, and perceptions of urban park
   visitors remained unexplored in Saudi cities. This study aimed to find
   out the use patterns, attitudes, and perceptions of people regarding
   urban parks during the COVID19 pandemic, and the findings were compared
   with non-pandemic periods. Two urban parks (Al Masarah Garden and Al
   Jamaa Garden) in Jeddah megacity (Saudi Arabia) were assessed, and 215
   respondents were surveyed to fulfil the objectives of the study. The
   study applied a questionnaire survey and field observations to
   understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use patterns,
   attitudes, and perceptions of urban park visitors. Non parametric tests
   (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests) were performed to find out the
   impact of sociodemographic factors (such as age, gender, and education).
   From the results, it was found that the COVID-19 pandemic had a
   substantial impact on the use, attitudes, and perceptions of urban parks
   in comparison with non-pandemic periods. The number of park visitors
   decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but urban parks were crucial to
   people's mental and physical well-being. The findings of this study may

   implement measures to enhance the quality and quantity of urban green
   spaces in Saudi cities.},

Abstract = {Natural areas in cities are important refugia for wildlife, but some
   species also use developed areas. Such adaptation may be facilitated at
   the ecotone between natural and residential areas where wildlife
   encounter anthropogenic resources. We quantified human activities and
   objects that potentially attract coyotes (Canis latrans) by providing
   shelter, food, prey habitat, and novelty items where backyards back onto
   natural areas in Edmonton, Canada. We related attractant abundance and
   human demographic variables to coyote access to backyards, scat
   abundance, and the number and nature of reports detailing interactions
   with coyotes near the ecotone. Among 468 surveyed backyards, 31\% were
   accessed by coyotes, and we detected 2055 instances of attractants.
   Coyotes selectively accessed unfenced backyards with food and novelty
   items, and backyard access was most common along transects where fences
   were infrequent, and shelter was abundant. Evidence of deer on transects
   was weakly correlated with increased prevalence of scats. Public reports
   describing conflict with coyotes were more frequent in areas with more
   coyote access to backyards, fewer fences, and more shelter. Weak
   evidence indicated that food abundance, scat prevalence, and backyard
   access were higher in areas with larger houses and more
   university-educated and retired residents. These results suggest that
   coyotes frequently access attractants at the ecotone between natural and
   residential areas, which may promote habituation, food conditioning, and
   human-wildlife conflict. These effects could be reduced, and coexistence
   could be promoted with clearer boundaries separating natural and
   residential areas, opposing conventional recommendations for reserve
   design that encourage gradual transition zones.},

   in the Tokyo area, and found that the frequency of childhood play in
   green spaces was correlated positively with that of nature-based
   activities from gardening to international nature-based tourism, and
   even more strongly so than age, gender, and income. Given that
   participation in nature-based recreational activities reflects people's
   interest in and appreciation of nature and can contribute to nature
   conservation, the creation and effective design of urban green spaces
   where children can interact with nature will not only improve local
   environments, but also contribute to global nature conservation.},

Title = {Powerline Corridors Can Add Ecological Value to Suburban Landscapes When
   Not Maintained as Lawn},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Electric powerline corridors are informal green spaces that encompass
   large areas of land and have the potential to support biodiversity in
   urban and suburban landscapes. However, the extent to which these
   corridors provide novel habitats compared to the surrounding landscape
   is unclear. Biodiversity in corridors is often compared to that of
   ``natural{''} habitats despite the fact that the corridors are subject
   to frequent vegetation management. In urban and suburban landscapes,
   residential yards may provide a more appropriate comparison because they
   are a dominant type of green space and are also characterized by
   frequent vegetation management. We conducted a study of the biodiversity
   in suburban powerline corridors in northern Illinois, USA, and compared
   it to the biodiversity found in nearby residential yards. Our goal was
   to determine whether powerline corridors added ecological value to these
   suburban landscapes. We included three different management styles of
   powerline corridors: (1) frequently mowed and kept as lawn, (2) brush
   mowed on a five-year cycle ({''}old-field{''}), and (3) restored and/or
   maintained as native prairie. We measured the species richness and
   composition of plants, birds, and insect pollinators in corridors and
   yards. The corridor management types and comparison yards differed
   significantly in the richness of all three taxa, with old-field and/or
   prairie sites having greater species richness than mown corridors and/or
   comparison yards. Community composition also differed by management
   category. While the species richness of old-field sites tended to be
   high, prairie sites generally had more species of conservation interest.
   Our study shows that both old-field- and prairie-managed powerline
   corridors add habitat value to Midwestern U.S. suburban landscapes by
   providing alternative habitat types that support many species.
   Nonetheless, we suggest that managers looking to specifically support
   native and/or grassland specialist species in this region should manage
   sites as prairies when possible.},

Abstract = {Private residential yards are an important component of urban green
   space and a major contributor to the urban environment. Trees in private
   yards provide physical and psychological benefits, but little research
   has been done, for example, in China. This study examined the
   characteristics of 143 private residential yards and 955 yard trees
   across a range of villages and communities along a gradient from rural
   to peri-urban to urban in Zhoukou city, central China. Overall, 65\% of
   dwellings had yards, and of these yard dwellings, 57\% had trees. Yard
   size was the most significant constraint on the number of trees and the
   species planted. Trees in private yards were typically small as
   constrained by yard size. Available space, tree counts, species counts,
   and species diversity were all lowest in urban yards. Species
   composition was homogeneous across villages and communities, with a
   preference for edible species like persimmon and pomegranate in rural
   areas. Although small, private yards contributed significantly to the
   urban ecosystems. Three features of private yards, i.e. small trees, a
   small area available for trees, and homogenous species suggest the need
   for large trees, more trees, and richer biodiversity, e.g. in public
   spaces, to achieve the targets of urban green infrastructure. These
   insights into the attributes of private yard trees can improve greening
   strategies for sustainable urban and rural developments.},

Abstract = {Cemeteries are globally culturally protected greenspaces in cities that
   meet different societal needs and often harbor high biodiversity. To
   harness the potential of cemeteries as urban green infrastructure,
   stakeholders need to understand why people visit cemeteries and their
   preferences. We conducted an online survey in Berlin, Germany (n = 627)
   to understand (i) the reasons for cemetery visits; (ii) preferences for
   cemetery features; (iii) the effect of a dead tree as a wilderness
   component on preferences for differently managed green areas (wild,
   meadows, lawns); (iv) preferences of nature elements as comforting
   experiences; and (v) how reasons for the visit and sociodemographic
   variables relate to respondents' preferences. The major reasons to visit
   cemeteries were `enjoying nature', `mourning', and `historical interest'
   and most preferred cemetery features were `wildlife', `solitude', and
   `vegetation'. Presenting a dead tree did not modulate preference ratings
   for green areas that were depicted on photographs. Comforting
   experiences with nature elements were high overall. The reasons to visit
   had besides socio-demographic variables predictive potential on
   pronounced preferences. The results underscore the importance of
   cemeteries as multidimensional places and indicate tolerance for the
   inclusion of dead trees as important wildlife habitat. Strategies to
   develop cemeteries as shared habitats for people and nature should also
   consider, besides socio-demographic background, the reasons for cemetery
   visits.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {61},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The structure of bird communities living in cities may have different
   characteristics depending on the magnitude of building versus green
   area. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of residential
   backyards to the diversity of urban birds in the city of Jacarei, Sa?o
   Paulo, Brazil. We hypothesized that the composition and structure of
   bird communities would change according to (1) backyard, (2)
   neighborhood characteristics, (3) seasonality, and (4) bird species.
   Backyard characteristics assessed include area, vegetation structure
   (number of plant species), tree mean height, number of trees, percent of
   impervious surfaces, and presence of pets, such as dogs and cats. In a
   400 m radius buffer around each backyard we measured the number and
   total area of green spaces, number of neighborhood trees, and nearest
   backyard distance. Surveys were performed during the non-breeding period
   (summer, autumn, and winter). Backyard area, pet presence, and number of
   trees in the neighborhood in which the backyard is located were
   positively correlated with bird richness. In turn, abundance was more
   strongly influenced by the period of visit, number of shrubs above 2 m
   tall, and nearest backyard distance. Our results showed that the
   backyards that present characteristics such as largest area, tallest
   trees and shrubs and that are close to isolated trees and other green
   areas increase the possibilities of species, especially native species,
   to remain in urban areas. Therefore, this study expands our knowledge of
   the effect of urbanization on avian diversity in a typical Latin
   American city inserted in the Atlantic Forest biome and shows the
   importance of private green areas to the composition of the landscape
   and conservation of urban biodiversity},

Abstract = {Urban expansion is considered to be one of the main threats to global

   composition. Urban intensification, chemicals, climate change and
   increased honey bee colony densities all negatively affect urban
   pollinators. Maintaining good areas of habitat for pollinators, such as
   those found in allotments (community gardens) and domestic gardens, and
   improving management approaches in urban greenspace and highly urbanised
   areas (e.g. by increasing floral resources and nesting sites) will
   benefit pollinator conservation. Opportunities for pollinator

Abstract = {In the United States, residential yards are typically overlooked for

   quantitative remote sensing approaches with analysis of qualitative
   interview data to examine residential vegetation patterns and analyze
   the socio-cultural relationships between people and vegetation. Data

   socio-cultural influences: aesthetics, norms, reference-group behavior,
   institutions, socioeconomics, and identity. Front yard land-use and
   decision-making practices are particularly meaning laden, as these

Abstract = {Managing non-native species in cities is often controversial because
   these species can support both ecosystem services and disservices. Yet,
   how the acceptability of non-native species management by the general
   public differs in relation to native species, to distance (i.e. close to
   residence and elsewhere) and among plants and animals is understudied.
   Furthermore, while values, beliefs and knowledge are often considered in
   this context, psychometric factors such as emotions and anthropomorphic
   views have received little attention. We surveyed 658 residents in
   Berlin, Germany, to assess (i) the acceptability of management actions
   differing in their severity for non-native plants and animals compared
   to native species with similar traits, (ii) the influence of perceived
   distance of species (i.e. close to residence and elsewhere) and (iii)
   the predictive potential of psychometric (i.e. values, beliefs,
   self-assessed knowledge, emotions and anthropomorphism) and
   socio-demographic factors for this acceptability. Eradication (i.e.
   lethal control/removal) was generally the least accepted management
   action, but more accepted for non-native than native species. Distance
   mattered for the acceptability of non-native plant management with
   unspecified control action the most accepted management action close to
   residence. While values (self-transcendence and conservation) mostly
   explained the acceptability of doing nothing and eradication, emotions
   related strongly to all management actions. Beliefs were more important
   than self-assessed knowledge in relation to non-native species
   management and beliefs about non-native plants and animals were rated
   almost similar. Anthropomorphic views had predictive potential for
   plants and animals; that is, the stronger people held anthropomorphic
   views, the less they accepted eradication. Participants with a garden
   supported doing nothing with plants (native and non-native) more than
   without. Results highlight the complexity of factors underlying the
   acceptability of management actions on species in cities. While values,
   beliefs and self-assessed knowledge are important in the context of
   species management, other psychometric factors add to our understanding
   of acceptability. We conclude that awareness about different
   acceptability patterns related to species management can support
   environmental policies on biological invasions in cities. Tailoring and
   implementing adequate management actions can benefit from incorporating
   cognitive but also affective factors of the public. Read the free Plain

Abstract = {The expansion of coyotes (Canis latrans) into the northeastern United
   States is a major challenge to wildlife professionals, especially in
   suburban and urban areas where reports of human coyote interaction (HCI)
   are on the rise. To assist wildlife professionals in identifying
   potential hot spots of interaction and homeowners in evaluating their
   risk of a backyard encounter, we used the techniques of citizen science
   to build a landscape model of HCI for suburban residential properties in
   Westchester County, New York, USA. We distributed surveys via school
   children (kindergarten to grade 12) as part of a voluntary class
   assignment, to maximize the number of homeowners participating in our
   study and to provide learning experiences for students. Of 6,000 surveys
   distributed to schools, >1,500 students interviewed their parents on
   whether a coyote had been seen or heard on their property from 2003 to
   2006. Although surveys could not be distributed randomly owing to the
   participatory process of individual schools, we did receive responses
   from across Westchester County, representing the spectrum from the most
   rural to the most urban towns. Homeowners who encountered (i.e., seen or
   heard) a coyote on their property were on average 50\% closer to forest,
   36\% closer to grassland, and 66\% farther from medium- to
   high-intensity development, complementing existing knowledge on urban
   coyote habitat use. Our model seemed robust in predicting an independent
   set of coyote observations (r = 0.88). Based on this model, we generated
   a map describing the probability of HCI that can be used by both
   wildlife professionals and homeowners. Regarding the former, state
   wildlife agencies could more precisely target education campaigns on how
   to live with coyotes where the possibility of HCI was greatest.
   Homeowners, in turn, could evaluate their own risk and modify behaviors
   that would make their property less attractive to coyotes. Furthermore,
   in creating a descriptive model of HCI from citizen-generated data, we
   demonstrated how citizen science can be a useful exploratory tool,
   generating a wealth of data over a large geographic area in a short
   period, especially when the inquest is appropriate to stakeholder
   participation in data collection.},

Abstract = {Urbanisation results in the loss and alteration of natural wetlands and
   ponds. However, garden ponds in cities and towns can potentially act as
   rich reservoirs of aquatic biodiversity and stepping stones for
   dispersal. Homeowners with a range of different motivations, including
   biodiversity values, install garden ponds. Here, our main aim was to
   study whether the design and management choices of garden pond owners
   depended on the location of ponds (capital city vs. countryside), when
   ponds were installed (pond age), or whether fish were introduced. We
   surveyed 834 garden pond owners across Hungary using a citizen science
   questionnaire, asking questions on pond size, location, construction
   date and materials, vegetation structure, introduction of fish and
   management practices. From 753 validated responses, we found that the
   introduction of fish into ponds and high urbanisation were strongly
   associated with local features and management practices, especially
   large ponds with a water circulation feature, irrespective of pond age.
   A typical garden pond in Hungary is similar to 20 m(2), < 10 years old,
   made of rubber lining, contains fish, aquatic vegetation and circulating
   water, and is actively managed. There was a spatial separation of ponds
   based on local features between ponds in the capital city (Budapest) and
   elsewhere. These findings suggest that garden pond owners in the city
   were more likely to make different choices in pond design and management
   compared to owners in regional areas. Our results also suggest that pond
   owners may primarily select management practices to improve habitat
   quality for ornamental fish. Our findings have important implications
   for maintaining aquatic biodiversity in urban areas, where garden ponds
   may be the only aquatic habitat available.},

Abstract = {Private yards comprise a significant component of urban lands, with
   managed lawns representing the dominant land cover. Lawns blanket >
   163,000 km(2) of the United States, and 50\% of urban and suburban
   areas. When not treated with herbicides, lawns have the capacity to
   support a diversity of spontaneous (e.g., not planted) flowers, with the
   potential to provide nectar and pollen resources for pollinators such as
   native bees. In order to determine the extent to which suburban lawns
   support these important species, we surveyed lawns in 17 suburban yards
   in Springfield, MA, between May and September 2013 and 2014.
   Householders participating in the study did not apply chemical
   pesticides or herbicides to lawns for the duration of the study. We
   collected 5,331 individual bees, representing 111 species, and 29\% of
   bee species reported for the state. The majority of species were native
   to North America (94.6\%), nested in soil (73\%), and solitary (48.6\%).
   Species richness was lower for oligolectic (specialists on a single
   plant; 9.9\%) and parasitic species (12.6\%). Abundance percentages for
   number of individuals were similar. We documented 63 plant species in
   the lawns, the majority of which were not intentionally planted. The
   most abundant lawn flowers were dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and
   clover (Trifolium sp.). Nearly 30\% of the spontaneous plant species
   growing in the lawns were native to North America. Our study suggests
   that the spontaneous lawn flowers could be viewed as supplemental floral
   resources and support pollinators, thereby enhancing the value of urban
   green spaces.},

   rainforest has been clear-felled in order to grow tea plantations. Such
   plantations now exist as islands of agriculture surrounded by forest
   tracts, most of which are protected as wildlife sanctuaries. We report a
   case study from one such tea garden. We observed a diversity of wild
   mammals, both herbivores and carnivores, using open grass patches,
   swamps and vegetation along streams in the tea garden. Large mammals
   were observed to forage in such areas and return to the adjoining
   forests. Small mammals were either resident or used stream vegetation as
   a corridor to move from one side of the forest to the opposite side.
   Dhole (Cuon alpinus) often preyed on sambar (Cervus unicolor) and even
   denned twice in the estate. We also observed a minimal human-animal
   conflict in the area. Problems such as stealing of meat from sambar
   kills made by dhole, could be overcome by awareness. We propose that
   such areas can be effectively managed such that it could facilitate
   movement of wild mammals with least damage to the commercial activity
   related to tea. Such a wildlife management strategy can become a model
   that could be followed in tea-growing areas throughout the Western
   Ghats.},

Abstract = {Urban agriculture (UA) is regarded as an emerging tool and strategy for
   sustainable urban development as it addresses a wide array of
   environmental, economic and social objectives. Home gardening represents
   a common form of UA in the close living environments of urban dwellers
   that can be particularly important for rapidly growing cities and
   metropolitan regions in developing and transitional countries. However,
   a structured conceptual analysis of different urban sustainability
   benefits, including its operationalisation, is lacking. We therefore
   investigated whether and to which extent home gardening practices in
   urban residential environments contribute to urban sustainability. In
   detail, we analysed the contribution of prevailing cultivation
   practices, socio-economic situations, motivation, knowledge and
   networking of individual household and external framework conditions to
   the environmental, economic and socio-cultural dimensions of urban
   sustainability. Between January and May 2014, we conducted a
   questionnaire survey among 111 gardeners in residential neighbourhoods
   of Pune (India) and applied an analytical framework using composite
   indicators with index values to the compiled data. Our main results
   showed that sustainability benefits can be expected especially in
   environmental and socio-cultural aspects, particularly for urban
   biodiversity conservation and aesthetic green urban spaces, and less
   expected in economic contributions and food production. Gardening
   practice and sustainability contribution is rather determined by the
   motivation and socio-demographic factors of the gardener than type and
   size of the garden. We conclude that conserving and building home
   gardens can contribute to urban sustainability and should therefore be
   considered in the planning, design and management of urban spaces.},

Abstract = {The Caribbean is a biodiversity hotspot due to its rich biodiversity and
   wholesale loss of primary vegetation. Yet, there is a paucity of studies
   on the status and trends of terrestrial avifauna populations in the
   region. We combined survey data from six habitats (Quill and Gilboa
   Hill, Town, Botanical Garden, Garden Road, and Venus Bay) on a small
   Lesser Antillean island over a seven-year period. Species abundance and
   richness varied among habitats, with Town having the highest species
   richness. Logistic regressions revealed significant differences among
   habitat and year (P = 0.008), but not foraging guild, season, rainfall
   or elevation (P > 0.05). The Quill (P = 0.0003) and Town (P = 0.001)
   differed significantly from the other habitats surveyed. Granivorous +
   frugivorous and omnivorous species were most commonly detected in the
   Quill, whereas nectarivores and granivores were most commonly detected
   in Town. The influence of total annual precipitation on bird detection
   rates was unsubstantial. However, site-specific climate data for the
   different habitats are not available. Though resident landbird
   populations on St. Eustatius were stable over the survey period, we
   recommend that annual monitoring continue in the same habitats,
   especially following extensive vegetation damage caused by hurricanes
   Irma and Maria in September 2017 and in light of predicted global
   climate change. The results of our monitoring proved useful in
   evaluating protected areas and Important Bird Areas compared with
   non-protected areas. We encourage island researchers and conservation
   stewards to initiate similar long-term monitoring in order to determine
   the status of their resident landbird populations.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Concern has been expressed over societal losses of plant species
   identification skills. These losses have potential implications for
   engagement with conservation issues, gaining human wellbeing benefits
   from biodiversity (such as those resulting from nature-based
   recreational activities), and early warning of the spread of problematic
   species. However, understanding of the prevailing level of species
   identification skills, and of its key drivers, remains poor. Here, we
   explore socio-demographic factors influencing plant identification
   knowledge and ability to classify plants as native or non-native,
   employing a novel method of using real physical plants, rather than
   photographs or illustrations. We conducted face-to-face surveys at three
   different sites chosen to capture respondents with a range of
   socio-demographic circumstances, in Cornwall, UK. We found that survey
   participants correctly identified c.60\% of common plant species, were
   significantly worse at naming non-native than native plants, and that
   less than 20\% of people recognised Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica,
   which is a widespread high profile invasive non-native in the study
   region. Success at naming plants was higher if participants were female,
   a member of at least one environmental, conservation or gardening
   organisation, in an older age group (than the base category of 18-29
   years), or a resident (rather than visitor) of the study area.
   Understanding patterns of variation in plant identification knowledge
   can inform the development of education and engagement strategies, for
   example, by targeting sectors of society where knowledge is lowest.
   Furthermore, greater understanding of general levels of identification
   of problematic invasive non-native plants can guide awareness and
   education campaigns to mitigate their impacts.},

Title = {Local knowledge of homegarden plants in Miao ethnic communities in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {BackgroundHomegardens are small-scale land use systems with significant
   implications for local livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and
   sustainable development due to their diverse flora and fauna. Conducting
   homegarden surveys enables researchers to gain insights into the
   traditional ecological knowledge of indigenous communities, preserve
   homegarden biodiversity, and promote sustainable livelihoods. This study
   has two objectives: first, to collect, record, and organize data on
   homegarden plants and related traditional knowledge from three
   communities in the Laershan Plateau, and second, to analyze the species
   and functional diversity of homegarden plants in the region while
   exploring the factors that contribute to the heterogeneous distribution
   of these plants among the communities of three townships.MethodsThis
   research employed field surveys in the Laershan Miao Autonomous Region
   in Xiangxi, China, from September 2021 to August 2023. Data were
   collected through observation and semi-structured interviews. The study
   utilized descriptive statistics and quantitative analysis, including the
   Relative Importance Value (RI), Use Value Index (UV), Jaccard Index
   (JI), and Comprehensive Index of Land Use Degree (La), to examine the
   diversity of local homegarden plants and related traditional knowledge,
   as well as community heterogeneity.ResultsThe study area exhibited rich
   biodiversity, with 152 plant species recorded belonging to 62 families
   and 124 genera. These findings highlight the importance of homegarden
   plants in maintaining ecological balance and enhancing system resilience
   against disturbances. Homegarden plants serve multiple functions such as
   food, ornamental, medicinal, and fodder purposes, with edible and trade
   plants having the most abundant knowledge. Furthermore, this research
   revealed that communities with similar forest resource compositions may
   have similar homegarden plant compositions, demonstrating the connection
   between cultural exchange among different communities and patterns of
   plant species distribution.ConclusionsThe Laershan region boasts diverse
   homegarden plant species crucial for ecological balance and resilience.
   Their multifunctionality reflects human impact. Plant diversity varies
   with residents' lifestyles, needs, and cultural exchanges. The close
   connection between plants and local life is clear. Factors like resource
   distribution, cultural exchange, and lifestyle influence plant
   distribution. Further research is needed for conservation and
   sustainable development. Future research should focus on culturally
   valuable plant species and traditional knowledge applications.},

Title = {Rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) den site selection: preference for
   artificial sites},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {244-248},
Abstract = {Context. Objective assessments of habitat requirements for endangered
   species are often lacking when planning management strategies, and
   inappropriate landscape manipulation can sometimes turn an endangered
   species into a pest. Recent expansive population growth of the rock
   hyrax Procavia capensis in northern Israel has been attributed largely
   to the proliferation of man-made boulder piles on the fringes of new
   residential developments.
   Aims. The hyrax is a protected species, but when in proximity to
   residential areas it can be a garden pest and is medically important as
   a reservoir of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Management should thus consider
   preservation of hyrax populations in combination with minimising pest
   potential. We examined the hypothesis that hyraxes prefer artificial
   boulder piles to natural outcrop crevices as den sites.
   Methods. We surveyed all 57 potential den sites in a 1 x 1 km area
   around a village in northern Israel, and conducted logistic regression
   to examine the correlation of hyrax presence with site type (pile or
   crevice), size, distance from the village, distance from other den sites
   and network centrality within the den site network. We used the Aikaike
   information criterion (AIC) to compare logistic models.
   Key results. Occupancy was well predicted by site type, site size, and
   distance from other sites, explaining 59\% of the variation in the
   logistic regression. These three predictors were selected both by
   considering the combination of predictors that gave the lowest AIC
   value, and also by the stepwise logistic algorithm.
   Conclusions and implications. Hyrax den site preference, and in
   particular preference for boulder piles over natural crevices, should be
   integrated into managing this species simultaneously for conservation
   and pest control in the face of continuing residential encroachment on
   natural areas.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {285},
Number = {4},
Pages = {256-265},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Conservation biology and landscape ecology are increasingly concerned
   with the effects of urbanization on wildlife, including the influences
   of habitat edges. This is particularly important in landscapes where a
   restriction on species home-range movements may reduce an animal's
   ability to access habitat resources, which ultimately reduces population
   viability. Despite this, there is limited information available on the
   movement behavior of wildlife at forest edges adjoining urban areas. We
   addressed this by radiotracking 30 squirrel gliders Petaurus
   norfolcensis in forest interiors and near road and residential edges in
   the fragmented urban landscape of south-east Queensland, Australia. An
   assessment of fixed-kernel (FK100\% and FK50\%) and minimum convex
   polygon (MCP100\%) methods revealed that FK provided the most reliable
   home-range estimates. We applied a general linear model to test the
   influence of season, age and sex relative to habitat type (forest
   interiors, road edge, residential edge) on squirrel glider home-range
   size (FK95\% \& FK50\%). We found that squirrel gliders living in
   interior habitats had significantly larger home ranges (7.07 ha +/-
   0.43) than individuals living near roads (3.79 ha +/- 0.22) and
   residential areas (3.40 ha +/- 0.26). Similarly, home-range core areas
   (FK50\%) were significantly larger in forest interiors (1.49 +/- 0.13
   ha) than near road (0.78 +/- 0.07 ha) and residential edges (0.70 +/-
   0.08 ha). We also found that squirrel gliders regularly cross narrow
   roads up to 20m wide and with a tree gap up to 15m to access adjacent
   vegetation, and are willing to utilize foraging resources in residential
   backyards. Changes in squirrel glider home ranges near edges identified
   in this study have implications for understanding how this species
   responds to urban edges, and we highlight important areas for future
   edge-related studies to correctly inform conservation and management.},

   Distribution, diffusion, and mitigation},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The conflict between humans and wild animals is a special type of
   phenomena between human development and wild animal conservation, not
   only leading to massive economic loss to local residents, but also
   imposing severe impacts upon the production and living activities and
   even personal safety of the residents. Human-elephant conflict has
   existed as a phenomenon of human settlement development for more than 20
   years in Xishuangbanna, China. There are periodic incidents of wild
   elephants hurting/killing people as well as feeding on and destroying
   subsistence and cash crops. It is an increasingly urgent and important
   issue for China to resolve while protecting and managing Asian
   elephants. Our study employed an Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis model
   to perform a risk assessment of areas where the Asian elephant currently
   is distributed and to predict future risks. It employed a Circuit Theory
   model based on random walk theory to predict multiple potential movement
   or migration pathways of Asian elephants within Xishuangbanna. The
   results indicated that: (1) the regions with human-elephant conflict
   risk in Xishuangbanna Prefecture had an area of about 4349.08 km(2),
   accounting for 22.77\% of the total prefecture area, with the risk
   regions primarily present in the middle and north parts of Menghai
   County and Jinghong City and in Mengla County in which there was a wide
   geographical distribution covering from the south to the north; (2) The
   regions of agriculture and garden that were close to Asian elephant
   distribution and roads were likely occurring risk; (3) There were more
   potential movement paths of elephants within Mengyang and Menghai
   distribution regions, which indicated that the connection of these areas
   was better. While the potential movement paths of elephants within
   Mengla and Shangyong were little; (4) There were some potential movement
   paths between different distribution areas of Asian elephant, but the
   migration possibility of elephants in different distribution areas was
   decreasing due to natural barriers (Mengyang-Menghai has Lancang river)
   and discontinuous potential paths between Mengla and Shangyong.
   Additionally, we discussed that created ecological corridors between
   different natural reserves to allow more dispersal and gene flow of
   elephants and diminish conflict between human and elephant. We also put
   forward compensation suggestions in different risk area. We hope our
   analytical methods can be applied, improved and expanded to other areas
   with similar wildlife damage. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by

   study results showed that among the species recorded in five residential
   type (traditional housing, detached housing, villa, apartment blocks and
   sites, mass housing for employees), non-native taxa frequency of a total
   species are much and dominantly represent residential landscape
   structure. Additionally, the species richness and diversity is
   positively related to new urban development areas. But, it was clearly
   determined that the vegetation structure has tended to ornamental
   purposes different from traditional residential gardens including fruit
   and other benefiting species. Consequently, it can be evidence that the
   residential vegetation is ornamental plant resources to urban

Title = {Exploring Homeowner Diffusion of Yard Care Knowledge as One Step Toward

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Urban ecosystems are increasingly influenced by residential yard care
   decisions. This had led researchers to focus on homeowner education
   programs when it comes to yard care. Typically, the success of programs
   designed to influence yard care is based on whether the target subject
   changes his or her behavior in a more environmentally conscious manner.
   This threshold, however, fails to consider if individuals share this
   information with their friends and neighbors, thus having a possible
   spillover effect. In this paper, we focus on the transmission of new
   lawn management information among neighbors and consider (1) if
   individuals discuss information they learned in a short-term educational
   program, (2) what factors are associated with diffusion, (3) what
   information individuals share, and (4) what barriers to transmission
   exist. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, we used data from
   a mailed survey, group discussions, and mailed information exchanges.
   Results indicate that best management practices for yards can diffuse
   through the neighborhood (approximately 34 \% shared information with
   their neighbors in a one-month period). In addition, factors such as (1)
   attending a group discussion, 2) individual social connectedness, (3)
   length of home ownership, and (4) the presence of children in the
   household were found to be positively related to increased sharing of
   information. Also, for lawns, the content of information shared tended
   to be about increasing grass height and reducing fertilizer
   applications. Finally, we find barriers to sharing ideas based on
   spatial, temporal, or perception factors but overcoming some of these
   barriers is possible.},

Title = {Influence of Vineyard Inter-Row Management on Grapevine Leafhoppers and
   Their Natural Enemies},
Journal = {INSECTS},
Year = {2024},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Simple Summary: The inter-row management strategy in the vineyard
   influences the diversity of the vegetation and, consequently, the
   presence and activity of natural enemies of grapevine pests. This study
   aims to evaluate whether the replacement of periodical tillage with the
   alternate mowing of the resident herbaceous vegetation in vineyard
   inter-rows reduces the density of the European leafhoppers Hebata vitis
   and Zygina rhamni by improving the presence and activity of their
   natural enemies in the context of conservation biological control. The
   results show that, on grapevines with ground vegetation, the number of
   hunting spiders increases, thus reducing the leafhopper population with
   their predation activity. Green covering also improves hymenopteran
   parasitoids characterized for their important role in the grapevine pest
   control. A greater vegetation diversity in the vineyard improves the
   landscape quality of the agroecosystem and, by supporting the activity
   of the natural enemies of grapevine pests, reduces the need for
   insecticide applications in the vineyards. Inter-row management in
   vineyards can influence the abundance of grapevine pests and their
   natural enemies. In 2013-2015, in a vineyard in northeastern Italy, the
   influence of two vineyard inter-row management strategies (i.e.,
   alternate mowing, AM, and periodical tillage, PT) on the population
   dynamics of grapevine leafhoppers Hebata vitis and Zygina rhamni and
   their natural enemies, the mymarid Anagrus atomus and spiders (Araneae),
   and other hymenopteran parasitoids, were studied with different survey
   approaches. The infestations of both leafhoppers were lower in AM than
   PT due to the reduced leafhopper oviposition and higher nymph mortality
   in AM. This occurred although leafhopper egg parasitization by A. atomus
   was greater in PT than AM according to a density-dependent relationship
   with the leafhopper egg amount. Hymenopteran parasitoids other than A.
   atomus were the most abundant in AM, probably due to the higher
   availability of nectar and pollen than in PM. The significantly higher
   population densities of hunting spiders in AM than PT can be associated
   with the higher predation of leafhopper nymphs. Therefore, the study
   demonstrated that the alternate mowing of vineyard inter-rows enhances
   the abundance of natural enemies, such as spiders and hymenopteran
   parasitoids, and can contribute to grapevine leafhopper pest control.},

Abstract = {The documentation of many rare or declining bee species in urban green
   spaces has led to a recent focus on cities as conservation targets.
   However, for pollinator conservation to succeed long term, we argue that
   the opinions and values of local community members must be prioritized
   more explicitly. In our experience, conservation is difficult to achieve
   when the aesthetic and safety concerns of urban residents are not
   reconciled with the goals and habitat designs of conservation
   practitioners. Similarly, from a bee ecology perspective, many questions
   concerning optimal design and management practices for pollinator
   habitats in cities remain unresolved. It is our hope that frank
   discussion of the challenges associated with urban pollinator
   conservation in public green spaces will inspire thoughtful
   consideration of how best to implement new initiatives in cities.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {151},

Abstract = {The value of urban biodiversity is increasingly emphasised from both
   social and ecological perspectives, as biodiversity has been linked to
   providing multiple benefits ranging from supporting city sustainability
   to enhancing the health and well-being of individual residents. At
   present many urban studies lack integrated methods of assessing urban
   biodiversity that would allow the capture of both social and ecological
   values of green space and enable better management and planning for
   urban biodiversity. Here we introduce a method of scoring urban habitats
   at a fine scale, which measures habitat attributes that act as
   biodiversity indicators common to both social and ecological fields.
   This provides a single, comparable score that represents the capacity of
   habitats to support biodiversity and people's connection to that
   biodiversity. Our results show a clear ranking of urban spaces from
   those characterised as being wilder and greener, to those dominated by
   paved surfaces that are more highly managed. We applied this scoring
   approach to predict and compare biodiversity across neighbourhoods in
   three New Zealand cities. We found biodiversity across neighbourhoods
   was significantly related to socioeconomic class, due mainly to the
   greater cover of mature gardens of high biodiversity value in regions of
   higher socioeconomic status. As such, while all neighbourhoods provided
   opportunities for residents to connect to nature through public green
   space, those people living in more deprived neighbourhoods are less
   likely to be exposed to nearby biodiverse spaces, and therefore may
   encounter fewer opportunities to connect to nature and gain the benefits
   which urban biodiversity can afford. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   insights into urban biodiversity design and management by identifying

Abstract = {Across Europe, hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) appear to be in decline
   in both urban and rural landscapes. Current methods used to monitor
   urban populations are, however, associated with several potential
   limitations. In this study, we conducted hedgehog footprint-tunnel
   surveys in 219 residential gardens across Reading, UK between
   May-September in 2013 and/or 2014; gardens were surveyed for five
   continuous days. Single-species occupancy models were used to
   investigate factors influencing hedgehog occupancy and two-species
   occupancy models were used to estimate a species interaction factor
   (SIF) between hedgehogs and (a) badgers (Meles meles), (b) foxes (Vulpes
   vulpes) and (c) dogs (Canis familiaris). The five-day survey protocol
   was associated with a false-absence error rate of 0.1-0.4\%, indicating
   that it was a reliable method for determining hedgehog presence;
   conversely, 34.7\% of householders were not able to correctly predict
   hedgehog presence or absence. Hedgehogs were widely distributed across
   Reading, but detected in only 32-40\% of gardens. None of the
   within-garden or outside-garden factors investigated significantly
   affected hedgehog occupancy in the single-species models, but the
   two-species models indicated that badgers (SIF=0.471 +/- 0.188), but not
   foxes (SIF=0.954 +/- 0.048) or dogs (SIF=0.780 +/- 0.228), negatively
   affected the presence of hedgehogs in gardens, although not
   significantly. Overall, footprint-tunnels represent a viable field
   method for monitoring urban hedgehog populations, however, other
   approaches are required to identify factors that make gardens hedgehog

   resource provisioning and site-based factors},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Artificial refuges provided by householders and/or conservation
   practitioners potentially represent one mechanism for mitigating
   declines in the availability of natural nest sites used for resting,
   breeding and hibernating in urban areas. The effectiveness of such
   refuges for different species is, however, not always known. In this
   study, we conducted a questionnaire survey of UK householders to
   identify factors associated with the use of ground-level nest boxes for
   West European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), a species of conservation
   concern. Overall, the percentage of boxes used at least once varied with
   season and type of use: summer day nesting (35.5-81.3\%), breeding (7.2-
   28.2\%), winter day nesting (20.1-66.5\%) and hibernation (21.7-58.6\%).
   The length of time the box had been deployed, the availability of
   artificial food and front garden to back garden access significantly
   increased the likelihood that a nest box had been used for all four
   nesting types, whereas other factors related to placement within the
   garden (e.g., in a sheltered location, on hardstanding such as paving,
   distance from the house) and resource provisioning (bedding) affected
   only some nesting behaviours. The factors most strongly associated with
   nest box use were the provisioning of food and bedding. These data
   suggest, therefore, that householders can adopt simple practices to
   increase the likelihood of their nest box being used. However, one
   significant limitation evident within these data is that, for welfare
   reasons, householders do not routinely monitor whether their box has
   been used. Consequently, future studies need to adopt strategies which
   enable householders to monitor their boxes continuously. Ultimately,
   such studies should compare the survival rates and reproductive success
   of hedgehogs within artificial refuges versus more natural nest sites,
   and whether these are affected by, for example, the impact of nest box
   design and placement on predation risk and internal microclimate.},

Abstract = {Plant biodiversity is affected by limiting resources such as water,
   nutrients, and sunlight. In urban settings, such as residential yards,
   however, limiting resources may also include the social factors of time
   and money spent on yard care. To examine the role that these precious
   human resources play in determining plant community structure and
   diversity, we surveyed homeowners and their yards in 12 neighborhoods
   across Baltimore City and Baltimore County, Maryland, visiting a total
   of 96 residential properties. We chose neighborhoods based on residents'
   median income (a proxy for money) and lifestage (a proxy for time) as
   determined by ESRI's Tapestry dataset {[}older (>65 and most likely
   retired with more free time) versus younger (<65 and most likely working
   with less free time)]. At each residential yard, we studied four major
   plant types: lawn species, flowering herbaceous plants (excluding
   grasses), trees, and invasive species. For the flowering plants, we
   documented the number, size, and color of flowers, and calculated total
   floral area. We found that residential yards harbored high plant
   diversity with 89 tree species, 82 lawn species, and 80 flowering plant
   genera. Lawn richness was not related to the neighborhood-level
   lifestage of the residents or their income; rather, all lawns were
   equally weedy. Consistently, we found that yards in higher income
   neighborhoods and larger yards had greater abundance of plants and
   greater diversity of flowering herbaceous plants, trees, and invasive
   species, whereas lifestage was rarely associated with plant diversity.
   Additionally, we found front yards had greater floral area than back
   yards, while back yards had greater tree abundance and tree diversity
   than front yards. Finally, we found that residents who spent more time
   doing yard work had more flowering plants, flower colors, and floral
   genera. Overall, yards in high-income neighborhood, and large yards had
   the greatest plant biodiversity, indicating that money is the more
   precious human resource for creating and maintaining biodiverse
   residential yards.},

   were consistent with studies elsewhere in that a greater number of
   social factors at the household scale were more important in explaining
   the traits related to how green the yards were. On the other hand, we
   failed to detect the so-called luxury effect on urban vegetation
   encountered at many sites. Instead, we found consistent vegetation
   associations with the age of the residents, housing ownership, and, most
   importantly, with yard size. We have discussed the potential reasons for

Number = {5},

Abstract = {Urbanization has destroyed and fragmented previously large areas of
   habitat. Small remnants that still exist in numerous cities will be
   unable to sustain many viable wild plant populations if they do not
   expand into the surrounding urban matrix. Residential gardens form a
   significant component of urban green space in many cities and therefore
   could play a role in redressing this problem. Our ecological and social
   scientific study examined factors influencing the dispersal and
   regeneration of 12 bird-dispersed native woody species from Riccarton
   Bush, a 7.8 ha urban forest remnant, into surrounding residential
   properties in Christchurch, New Zealand. Over 125 years, the reported
   number of native vascular plant species in the Bush has declined by a
   third. Some species, particularly Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, the dominant
   woody species in the Bush, are being dispersed by birds and establishing
   in residential gardens predominantly within 250 m of the forest margin.
   These juveniles are not reaching maturity as most gardeners tend to
   remove all non-planted woody species. This suggests natural potential
   for regeneration exists but is insufficient without active human
   intervention. Our survey results show people are supportive of native
   plants in general but lack knowledge of the species. They are willing to
   plant locally appropriate woody species if provided with plants,
   information, and, most importantly, control over the location of
   plantings. Residential gardens consequently have the potential to play a
   major role in the conservation of urban biodiversity especially for
   species suited to the functions and size of gardens.},

Abstract = {Green spaces within residential areas provide important contributions to
   the sustainability of urban systems. Therefore, studying the
   characteristics of these areas has become a research priority in cities
   worldwide. This project evaluated various aspects of the plant
   biodiversity of residential yards (i.e., front yards and back yards

   Puerto Rico). Our work included gathering information on vegetation
   composition and abundance of woody species (i.e., trees, shrubs, palms,
   ferns) and large herbs (>2 m height), species origin (native vs.
   introduced), and species uses (ornamental, food, and medicinal plants).
   A total of 424 yards were surveyed within an area of 187,191 m(2). We
   found 383 woody species, with shrubs being the most abundant plant
   habitat. As expected, residential yards hosted a disproportionate amount
   of introduced species (69.5\%). The most common shrub species were all
   non-native ornamentals, whereas the most common tree species included
   food trees as well as ornamental plants and two native species. Front
   yards hosted more ornamental species per unit area than backyards, while
   the latter had more food plants. The high amount of introduced species
   may present a challenge in terms of implementation of plant conservation
   initiatives if there is no clear definition of urban conservation goals.
   On the other hand, the high frequency of yards containing food plants
   may facilitate the development of residential initiatives that could
   provide future adaptive capacity to food shortages.},

Abstract = {Birds are a prominent component of urban biodiversity yet many species,

   transformation. We examined the relative influence of three factors that
   potentially influence forest bird communities in residential areas of
   Melbourne, Australia: (i) local habitat attributes; (ii) types of land
   use; and (iii) biotic interactions with an aggressive native species,
   the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). We also investigated
   characteristics of urban sites that contribute most to landscape-level
   diversity of forest species. We systematically surveyed forest birds at
   300 sites in a range of urban land-uses; with sites clustered in 30
   landscapes representing gradients in housing cover and tree cover.
   Composition and richness of forest bird communities differed among
   land-use types: sites with greater cover of native canopy trees had a
   distinct and richer avifauna. However, a pervasive influence on
   communities was the relative abundance of the noisy miner, a native
   species that aggressively excludes small insectivores. Sites in native
   vegetation made the greatest contribution to landscape-level richness of
   forest birds, but also were negatively influenced by noisy miner
   occurrence. The dominance of the noisy miner poses a challenge for
   conservation because actions to improve urban habitat for forest species
   may also benefit this aggressive species. Conservation of forest birds
   will depend on larger forest tracts, fringing residential areas, which
   are less suitable for the noisy miner and serve as potential source
   populations for forest species. Within residential areas, enhancing
   understorey complexity with native shrubs and mid-storey will help
   improve urban habitats for forest birds.},

Title = {Beyond proximity: Extending the ``greening hypothesis{''} in the context
   of vacant lot stewardship},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {197},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Research increasingly shows that greening activity can spur contagious
   or imitative behavior among nearby neighbors within residential
   landscapes. Krusky et al. (2015) examined this phenomenon in the context
   of vacant lots and found support for a ``greening hypothesis{''} that
   residential yards near vacant lots that were converted to community
   gardens exhibited higher levels of care than yards near untended vacant
   lots. Although such activity implies a temporal, causal relationship,
   research to date has only tested the spatial dimension of greening
   through correlational measures of proximity assessed at one point in
   time. We extend this work by analyzing vacant lot greening as a function
   of time, space, scale of analysis, and other factors. We studied
   residential property owners (N = 321) who purchased nearby city-owned
   vacant lots through the Chicago Large Lot Program. Improvements made in
   the condition and care of large lots in the year after purchase were
   positively related to the proximity, condition and care of the
   individual's previously owned property, and signs of use and care of the
   lot before purchase (blotting). We also examined whether block-level
   indicators of care and disorder were associated with improvements made
   to lots purchased on the block. We found few associations but discovered
   these same block-level indicators of care and disorder more strongly
   predicted the percent of large lots sold on that block, suggesting that

Abstract = {At the start of the 21st century, a coastal residential-estate marina
   was developed on a previously degraded and polluted brownfield island
   site within Knysna estuarine bay, Garden Route National Park, South
   Africa, including the creation of 25 ha of new flow-through tidal
   canals. Canals near the larger entrance to this system now support
   permanently submerged beds of seagrass, which in turn support abundant
   macrobenthic invertebrates. In comparison with equivalent
   seagrass-associated assemblages present in natural channels around the
   island, those in the artificial marina canals were similarly structured
   and dominated by the same species, but the marina assemblages were
   significantly more species-rich (1.4 x on average) and were more
   abundant. Indeed, this area of marina supports the richest
   seagrass-associated macrofaunal biodiversity yet recorded from South
   Africa. The canals created de novo therefore now form a valuable
   addition to the bay's marine habitat, in marked contrast to the
   generality that marinas developed on greenfield sites represent a net
   reduction in intertidal and shallow marine area and associated
   seagrass-associated benthos. If located and constructed appropriately,
   brownfield marina development and conservation of coastal marine
   biodiversity clearly need not be antithetical, and brownfield sites may
   provide opportunity for the location and management of `artificial
   marine micro-reserves' or for the action of `other effective area-based
   conservation measures' for soft-sediment faunas.},

   sustainable practices of its student residents. The hall provides an
   immersive learning environment, offering hands-on activities such as

   this study gathered quantitative data through a questionnaire on

   more than two semesters of residence in the hall. Qualitative research
   explored the impact of residential hall experiences on the residents'
   environmental mindset, uncovering three themes: immersive experiences,
   long-term habituation, and the visibility of outcomes. These findings
   suggest that living in a sustainability-themed residential hall shapes
   students' environmental attitudes and behaviors, reinforcing the value
   of integrating residential education within Environmental Sustainability
   Education (ESE) frameworks. This study highlights the potential of

Abstract = {Collection-based institutions-zoos, aquariums, museums, and botanical
   gardens-exhibit wildlife and thus have a special connection with nature.
   Many of these institutions emphasize a mission of conservation, and,
   undeniably, they do contribute directly to conservation education and
   conservation science. They present an exceptional opportunity for many
   urban residents to see the wonders of life, and they can contribute to
   education and habitat preservation. Because many collection-based
   institutions now hold a stated mission of conservation, we suggest eight
   potential questions to evaluate actions toward that mission: (1) Does
   conservation thought define policy decisions? (2) Is there sufficient
   organizational funding for conservation activities? (3) Is there a
   functional conservation department? (4) Does the institution advocate
   for conservation? (5) Do conservation education programs effectively
   target children and adults? (6) Does the institution contribute directly
   to habitat protection locally and internationally? (7) Do exhibits
   explain and promote conservation efforts? and (8) Do internal policies
   and activities protect the environment? These questions are offered as a
   place to begin discussion. We hope they will help employees and
   administrators of a collection-based institution (and citizens of the
   surrounding community) think about and support their institution's
   conservation activities. Public support and praise for institutions that
   are striving toward solutions for conservation problems and pressure on
   organizations that are moving more slowly toward a conservation
   orientation can help shift more resources toward saving nature.},

Abstract = {Alternatives to pesticides are necessary for the management of hop
   (Humulus lupulus L.) arthropod pests. The three major arthropod pests in
   northeastern US hop production include two-spotted spider mite,
   Tetranychus urticae Koch, hop aphid Phorodon humuli (Schrank), and
   potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae Harris. This 3-yr study (2012-2014) in
   Vermont investigated the effect of flowering ground covers on arthropod
   pest abundance. Hop cultivars `Nugget' and `Cascade' were evaluated
   under a strip-split plot experimental design. Ground cover treatments
   included 1) Control: mowed red clover (Trifolium pratense) and resident
   weeds, 2) Clover: red clover, and 3) Diverse: common yarrow (Achillea
   millefolium), beebalm (Monarda fistulosa), red clover, and annual
   sunflower (Helianthus annuus). Natural enemies were grouped by
   associated pest and indicated by our mixed model to be strong predictors
   of the number of hop aphid and potato leafhopper on hop plants. In year
   two, ground cover treatment had a significant effect on two-spotted
   spider mite abundance where fewer two-spotted spider mite were observed
   on hop plants in Diverse plots. The established, un-mowed Clover
   treatment was preferred by potato leafhopper over Diverse ground cover
   and hop plants. This revealed the potential for clover ground cover to
   serve as a trap crop for potato leafhopper management in northeastern
   hop yards. Our findings are evidence that ground covers implemented for
   conservation biological control may serve more specific pest management
   functions instead of or in addition to boosting top-down pest pressure.},

   biodiversity and conservation values of urban residential and public
   woodlands, Christchurch},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {149-162},
Abstract = {Urban forests are increasingly valued for multiple benefits such as
   amenity, cultural values, native biodiversity, ecosystem services, and
   carbon sequestration. Urban biodiversity in particular, is the new focus
   although global homogenisation is undermining regional differentiation.
   In the northern hemisphere (e.g., Canada and USA) and in the southern
   hemisphere, particularly in countries like South Africa, Australia,
   South America and New Zealand, local biodiversity is further impacted by
   historical colonisation from Europe. After several centuries, urban
   forests are now composed of synthetic and spontaneous mixtures of native
   species, and exotic species from around the temperate world (e.g.,
   Europe, North and South America, South Africa, Asia). As far as we are
   aware no-one has carried out in-depth study of these synthetic forests
   in any Southern Hemisphere city. Here we describe the composition,
   structure, and biodiversity conservation imperatives of urban temperate
   forests at 90 random locations in Christchurch city, New Zealand.
   We document considerable plant diversity; the total number of species
   encountered in the 253 sampled urban forest patches was 486. Despite
   this incredibly variable data set, our ability to explain variation in
   species richness was surprisingly good and clearly indicates that total
   species richness was higher in larger patches with greater litter and
   vegetation cover, and taller canopy height. Species richness was also
   higher in patches surrounded by higher population densities and closer
   to very large native forest patches. Native species richness was higher
   in patches with higher soil pH, lower canopy height, and greater litter
   cover and in patches closer to very large native forest patches
   indicating dispersal out of native areas and into gardens. Eight
   distinct forest communities were identified by Two-Way INdicator SPecies
   ANalysis (TWINSPAN) using the occurrence of 241 species that occurred in
   more than two out of all 253 forest patches.
   Christchurch urban forest canopies were dominated by exotic tree species
   in parklands and in street tree plantings (linear parkland). Native tree
   and shrub species were not as common in public spaces but their overall
   density high in residential gardens. There was some explanatory power in
   our data, since less deprivation resulted in greater diversity and
   density, and more native species, which in turn is associated with
   private ownership. We hypothesise that a number of other factors, which
   were not well reflected in our measured environmental variables, are
   responsible for much of the remaining variation in the plant community
   structure, e.g., advertising, peoples choice. For a more sustainable
   asset base of native trees in New Zealand cities we need more,
   longer-lived native species, in large public spaces, including a greater
   proportion of species that bear fruit and nectar suitable for native
   wildlife. We may then achieve cities with ecological integrity that
   present multiple historical dimensions, and sequester carbon in legible
   landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Urban areas are often perceived to have lower biodiversity than the

   Using a systems approach, we developed Bayesian network models
   integrating pollinator dispersal and resource switching to estimate
   city-scale effects of management interventions on plant-pollinator
   community robustness to species loss. We show that residential gardens
   and allotments (community gardens) are pollinator `hotspots': gardens
   due to their extensive area, and allotments due to their high pollinator
   diversity and leverage on city-scale plant-pollinator community
   robustness. Household income was positively associated with pollinator
   abundance in gardens, highlighting the influence of socioeconomic
   factors. Our results underpin urban planning recommendations to enhance
   pollinator conservation, using increasing city-scale community
   robustness as our measure of success.},

Abstract = {Residential green areas often represent a significant portion of a
   city's green infrastructure which has generated great interest in
   studying the factors that contribute to the formation of plant
   associations in residential yards. This project evaluated the external
   factors to the household social-ecological system that influence the
   availability of plants for residential landscapes and how they may
   influence the presence of native plants in residential yards on
   households within the Rio Piedras watershed in the metropolitan area of
   San Juan, Puerto Rico. The methods used included a residential survey
   with open and closed questions that addressed the sources of plants used
   in landscaping and an evaluation of ornamental plant species inventories
   from local nurseries. A total of 432 yards were surveyed. Yard plants in
   this watershed have multiple sources. Aside from obtaining plants at
   local nurseries, natural dispersion, exchanges among family and friends
   and historical plantings can be just as important sources of yard
   plants. Our results also suggest that the majority of residents do not
   know where to get native plants which could represent a challenge for
   the development and implementation of initiatives for natives gardening.
   At the same time, most commercial nurseries have a deficit of native
   plants in their inventories. This information is critical to species
   conservation strategies that seek the inclusion of urban residential
   areas and may help improve initiatives about the involvement of
   individual citizens in sustainable gardening practices at the

Abstract = {Most of the global population are urban, with inhabitants exposed to
   raised levels of pollution. Pollutants negatively impact human
   wellbeing, and can alter the structure and diversity of ecosystems.
   Contrastingly, urban biodiversity can positively contribute to human
   wellbeing. We know little, however, about whether the negative impacts
   of pollution on wellbeing could be lessened for householders living on
   more biodiverse streets, as the complex interlinkages between pollution,
   biodiversity and wellbeing have rarely been examined. Here, we used
   structural equation modelling to simultaneously test whether
   biodiversity (actual and perceived) mediates the relationship between
   traffic-related pollution (noise, dB; nitrogen dioxide, NO2) or air
   pollution (PM2.5) and wellbeing (mental wellbeing, happiness). In summer
   2019, we conducted questionnaires and biodiversity surveys, and
   collected noise and air pollution data, from households (n = 282) across
   the streetscapes of Leeds, UK. Biodiversity (actual or perceived) showed
   no mediating effects. However, increased flowering plant richness was
   positively associated with mental wellbeing. Traffic-related pollution
   negatively affected pollinator and flowering plant richness, but not
   wellbeing. This could be because householders are not exposed to high
   levels of noise or NO2 because they do not maintain front gardens on
   noisier streets. There was no measurable effect of air pollution on
   biodiversity or wellbeing. These findings shed light on the complex
   mechanisms through which biodiversity could improve human wellbeing.
   Enhancing the diversity of plant species in streetscapes would have a
   positive effect on wellbeing, further emphasising the important role
   that biodiverse urban streetscapes play in improving the liveability of
   cities.},

Abstract = {Wild bees are experiencing population declines globally. Despite

   urban residential gardens have the potential to become pollinator
   hotspots, increasing bee diversity and abundance. We explored public
   knowledge and attitudes towards bees, and `bee-friendly' interventions

   England, as a case study. An online questionnaire was distributed in
   2023 to residents with gardens or balconies. Results from 286 surveys
   showed 98.3\% of respondents performed >= 1 BFI and the most common
   action was planting ``pollinator-friendly{''} plants (75.9\%). Sentiment
   towards bees positively correlated to the number of BFIs performed, and
   94.8\% of respondents felt positively about bees. Most participants
   indicated altruistic motivations behind their performance of
   BFIs.Implications for insect conservation: Though the public are
   altruistically motivated to undertake conservation for wild bees, and
   most are performing at least one BFI, lack of knowledge and
   understanding is the biggest barrier preventing conservation action.
   Governments, policymakers, and plant retailers should direct citizens to
   wild bee conservation organisations to engage and inform the public

Volume = {159},
Pages = {37-44},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Private gardens can incorporate a diversity of habitats for wild species
   and also provide a valuable network for meta-populations. Recently,
   attempts have been made to promote garden practices that increase native
   biodiversity and structural heterogeneity relevant to plants and
   animals. However, little is known about whether such practices
   contribute to the aesthetic quality of gardens. This study was based on
   a survey of 36 garden owners in Switzerland, a species count in their
   gardens, and a photo-questionnaire with 249 Swiss residents who rated
   the attractiveness of the gardens. The gardens included a gradient from
   conventional orthodox (frequent lawn mowing and weeding, intensive use
   of pesticides and fertilizers) to ecological unorthodox (infrequent lawn
   mowing and weeding, no use of pesticides and fertilizers) gardening
   practices. Our results clearly show that scientific concepts of
   ecological quality can align with cultural concepts of aesthetic
   quality. The more ecologically managed a garden, the more species it
   contained. The more species the garden contained, the more attractive it
   was to the sample population. Aesthetically pleasing gardens were
   characterized by the public as natural and species-rich, whereas
   aesthetically displeasing gardens were characterized as boring, normal,
   and species-poor. Ecological gardening was not considered to be more
   time consuming than conventional gardening. A lack of practical know-how
   was a greater constraint. Respondents were tolerant towards ecological
   gardening, but would not want their garden to be considered as chaotic.

Abstract = {Focal species are valuable tools for evaluating management practices for
   biodiversity conservation. Butterfly gardening through the creation of
   appropriate habitats can be a primary conservation tool to increase
   species abundance and richness and gene flow among the populations in
   fragmented landscapes. In this context, the role of butterfly gardens in
   the conservation of butterfly populations and the seasonal population
   trends of swallowtail butterflies (family Papilionidae) sighted in the
   Butterfly Safari Park at Thenmala were studied. A total of 4760
   sightings of 15 species of swallowtails belonging to five genera were
   recorded, of which six were endemic species, three species had protected
   status and two were rare species. It is worth noting that of the 19
   species of the papilionids recorded in Kerala, as many as 15 species
   were recorded in Thenmala. Of the various species recorded, Troides
   minos, Pachliopta pandiyana, Pachliopta aristolochiae, Graphium
   agamemnon, Graphium sarpedon, Papilio polytes, Papilio clytia, Papilio
   demoleus and Papilio polymnestor comprised the resident populations,
   while species such as Atrophaneura hector, Papilio helenus, Papilio
   dravidarum, Papilio paris, Papilio liomedon and Graphium nomius were
   found only during certain seasons. The overall butterfly abundance was
   high from August to November. The butterfly populations exhibited a
   gradual decline in numbers from December onwards with the onset of dry
   seasons. The abundance of butterfly populations was low during
   March-April. The abundance of T. minos, P. pandiyana, P. polymnestor, P.
   paris, P. dravidarum, P. helenus, P. polytes and P. liomedon showed a
   significant negative correlation with monthly average temperature and a
   significant positive correlation with humidity.},

Abstract = {Human dimensions research can help resource and wildlife managers make
   informed decisions, target information efforts, and gain a greater
   understanding of the factors that comprise attitudes toward wildlife
   management efforts. Despite these often-stated merits, studies
   addressing the human dimensions of resource and wildlife management
   efforts are rare in Europe. A proposed restoration of free-ranging
   European bison (Bison bonasus) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, has
   presented an opportunity to help address this research gap. During May
   to July 2006, we used a randomly distributed, self-administered
   questionnaire (n = 398) to assess local residents' attitudes, beliefs,
   and levels of support or opposition toward the proposed restoration.
   These factors were compared across two administrative regions spanned by
   the proposed restoration area. We found that respondents from the
   Siegen-Wittgenstein region held significantly more positive attitudes
   and significantly higher knowledge levels than respondents from the
   Hochsauerlandkreis region. Principal components analysis revealed that
   attitudes comprised a general attitude factor pertaining to issues such
   as the importance of conserving bison for future generations and a
   lifestyle impact factor, which included items pertaining to bison-caused
   damages to trees and crops. Logistic regression was used to show the
   influence of fear of bison on attitudes. We discuss the likely causes
   and management implications of our findings and provide suggestions to
   managers wishing to target information efforts and address the concerns
   of those affected by the proposed restoration.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to identify the urban biodiversity in the
   residential landscapes and user preferences in Bartin urban area,
   located in the Western Black Sea Region, Turkey. The study was conducted
   in the residential gardens of the traditional urban fabric and the old
   urban pattern with conservation status at the national level (dwellings
   in the urban conservation area and registered buildings in the urban
   development area), and also in the new urban pattern (housing estates
   and detached houses). 120 residential gardens were selected and 140
   plant species belonging to 57 families were identified. The plant
   species in the first 10 percent of 140 plants according to user
   preferences are considered in the statistical analyses. The results of
   the study indicate that the residential landscapes in the old and new
   urban pattern of Bartin have a considerable potential in terms of
   biodiversity. While fruit trees and natural plant species characterize
   the residential gardens in the old urban pattern, exotic plant species
   are common in the new urban pattern. The users prefer plants in their
   gardens for their functional use, rather than aesthetical use. It is
   further observed that the users in the old urban pattern use the plants
   as they grow, whereas the users in the new urban pattern use plants
   obtained from nursery gardens. Analyzing the urban biodiversity
   inventory in Bartin at the residential garden scale, this study
   concludes with some suggestions for sustainable urban development.},

Title = {Collectively planting garden vegetation for biodiversity: Are hard
   surfaced gardens and householder unwillingness a constraint?},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Domestic gardens constitute important refuges for biodiversity. However,
   their typical small size mismatches with the larger scales at which
   species procure resources from urban areas. Consequently, they lack the
   capacity to enhance biodiversity at these scales. This could be
   addressed by aggregating garden resources (e.g. vegetation) and
   increasing garden connectivity. Specifically, this could involve
   neighbouring householders removing brick walls and fences that segregate
   gardens and collectively planting vegetation across garden boundaries.
   Nevertheless, insufficient research has explored 1) how hard surfacing
   gardens influences native/non-native vegetation presence, which could
   influence this action's effectiveness 2) the number of householders
   willing to undertake such action 3) reasons for unwillingness and how
   this could be resolved. These research gaps were addressed using an
   online householder questionnaire distributed weekly to the UK
   `followers' of four Facebook pages from January to December 2014. From a
   total of 276 respondents, 220 (84 \%) had gardens with hard surface and
   this had a significant negative association with native vegetation
   presence. Only 7 (3\%) presently collectively planted vegetation, but
   152 (58 \%) expressed future willingness. Desires to retain garden
   control and privacy predominantly underpinned unwillingness. In order to
   increase the effectiveness and prevalence of collectively planted
   vegetation, more stringent planning policy is required to restrict hard
   surfaced gardens. Moreover, desires for garden control and privacy need
   to be accommodated. This could be principally achieved by 1)
   communicating that little control would be lost as a result of this
   action 2) segregating gardens with hedges, which benefit biodiversity
   and simultaneously provide privacy.},

Title = {Honey bees and native flower visitors in a Boston suburb: Assessing
   coexistence and conservation strategies},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {299},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Concern that non-native honey bees ( Apis mellifera) may disrupt and
   outcompete native pollinators is leading governments to consider
   restricting honey bee hives. However, local-scale information on the
   specific flower visitation patterns of honey bees and native insects is
   often absent from the decision-making process. To address this concern,
   we observed insect visitation to 391 native and non-native plant species
   in Newton, Massachusetts (USA), a Boston suburb with extensive
   conservation areas and public and private gardens. We found that honey
   bees and native bees, including bumblebees and solitary bees, visited a
   wide variety of cultivated, native, adventive, and pollinator garden
   plants. Cultivated plants received more overall visits than wild plant
   species, but the most visited plants were often wild plant species with
   mixed visitation by honey bees and native pollinators. For many plant
   species, particularly cultivated plants, we did not observe any flower
   visitation. These findings suggest that at this suburban location,
   floral resources seem sufficient to allow coexistence between honey
   bees, bumblebees and other native bees. We suggest that residents and
   government officials consider doing simple surveys like this one prior
   to altering regulations of honey bees. In situations like Newton, in
   addition to evaluating regulations on honey bee hives, we suggest
   officials consider ways to reduce other threats to native
   flower-visiting insects, such as herbicide and pesticide use and habitat
   loss, while also planting pollinator gardens and wildflower meadows to
   increase available resources.},

Abstract = {A survey of 936 retail stores was conducted in Illinois to help

   response rate was 43\%, and significant differences in the level of

   were noted among lawn and garden stores, home improvement centers,
   hardware stores, and general merchandise stores. While 72\% of lawn and
   garden centers assigned specific employees to make pesticide
   recommendations, only 39\% of hardware stores identified a specialized
   employee. Over 80\% of lawn and garden centers referred customer
   questions to extension or Master Gardeners, while less than 20\% of
   general merchandise stores made similar referrals. Improving customer
   service was the most important potential outcome of additional employee
   training, followed by improving the ability of sales staff to explain
   product labels. Reducing potential liability was identified as an
   important training outcome by 68\% of home improvement centers. Fact
   sheets were identified by 60\% of respondents as being very useful to
   store employees, while programs at educational centers were identified
   by less than 20\% of respondents as being very useful. Retail stores
   that sell pesticides represent an important source of pest control

Abstract = {Urbanisation is a major cause of biodiversity loss but careful habitat
   management and provision of green space within cities can help to
   mitigate its negative effects. Grasslands occupy large surface areas and
   have many functions but only a few studies have begun to explore how
   birds exploit these habitats in urban contexts. We hypothesized that the
   value of grasslands for nesting and feeding birds is likely to depend
   both on landscape context, and on local characteristics (grassland size,
   use and vegetation structure). We surveyed local habitat
   characteristics, breeding bird presence, abundance and foraging activity
   in 47 grassland sites, distributed along an urban-rural gradient in two
   French cities, and varying in the proportions of grassland, built-up
   land and residential gardens in the neighbouring landscape. Species
   richness was influenced by local rather than landscape variables; larger
   sites with scrub within the grassland and taller hedgerow vegetation
   were more species rich. Total bird abundance, however, depended on
   landscape context, and increased in suburban grasslands with a higher
   proportion of gardens in the landscape. Foraging in grass was more
   frequently observed in shorter, regularly mown, recreational grasslands.
   These were more common in urban contexts and favoured by species
   requiring easily accessible and visible invertebrate prey. Less
   intensively managed wastelands were species rich despite being in urban
   contexts and favoured by seedeaters and one farmland specialist. A
   diversity of use and management of grasslands along the urban-rural
   gradient could allow birds with various requirements to co-exist at
   landscape scale.},

Title = {The more things change: species losses detected in Phoenix despite
   stability in bird-socioeconomic relationships},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The science of urban ecology has increasingly grappled with the
   long-term ramifications of a globally urbanized planet and the impacts
   on biodiversity. Some researchers have suggested that places with high
   species diversity in cities simply reflect an extinction debt of
   populations that are doomed to extinction but have not yet disappeared.
   The longitudinal studies conducted to date have found species
   composition shifting with urbanization but have not always documented
   continued species extirpations post-urbanization. We used long-term
   monitoring data on birds from the greater metropolitan area of Phoenix,
   Arizona, to measure changes in residential bird communities,
   species-habitat relationships, and human perceptions of bird species
   diversity over a five-year period. Bird richness, occupancy, and
   abundance decreased, as did the percentage of respondents satisfied with
   bird variety in their neighborhoods. As in previous analyses for this
   region, we found that desert specialist species were associated with
   neighborhoods with xeric landscaping consisting of gravel groundcover,
   and drought-tolerant, desert-adapted vegetation. These species were also
   found in neighborhoods with high per capita income rates and lower
   percentages of renters and I Iispanic/Latinx residents. Non-native
   species were positively associated with neighborhoods containing mesic
   yards with grass and other water-intensive vegetation. The proportions
   of yards in our surveyed neighborhoods with these distinct landscaping
   types likewise remained relatively stable over five-year period.
   Although habitat-species relationships remained unchanged, we detected
   significant loss of species across the sampling period. Declines were
   not confined to desert specialist species but included generalist and
   invader species as well. The parallel reduction in residents'
   satisfaction suggests that people perceive some aspect of this
   environmental degradation. Further investigation into the mechanisms
   underlying these species losses may reveal options for retaining some
   desert specialist species, and the uniqueness they contribute to urban
   fauna.},

Volume = {44},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Road easements are ubiquitous in urban landscapes but the green space
   they provide has been largely ignored, even though it represents a
   significant proportion of total urban green space. In this study, the
   extent and spatial distribution of green space within road easements are
   compared with private residential gardens and other public green space
   in Melbourne, Australia. Ground-surface permeability to water data and
   aerial photography were used to identify and quantify the extent of
   green space within 47 randomly selected neighbourhoods. Road easement
   green space constituted 7.0\% of land cover and a surprisingly high
   36.7\% of public green space. The percentage of the road easement that
   was green space was positively correlated with date of neighbourhood
   development, residential parcel size, footpath absence and social
   disadvantage. The percentage of residential parcels that was private
   garden was positively correlated with residential parcel size, but
   negatively correlated with road density, and positively correlated with
   date of neighbourhood development as date increased to the 1950s and
   then negatively correlated for the following decades. Streets with a
   greater percentage of road easement green space were associated with
   residential parcels that had a greater percentage of garden. The
   potential for road easement green space to provide for the biodiversity,
   ecosystem function and human amenity now being demanded from urban green
   spaces is much greater than previously thought. Planners, urban
   foresters, landscape architects, engineers and ecologists need to work
   together to reconsider the ecological and greening roles of existing
   road easements and consider this in future road designs. Our data
   suggests that the roles that residents, municipal governments and road
   authorities can play will vary across developments, with each presenting
   specific opportunities to improve the benefits flowing from road
   easement green space.},

Abstract = {Urban small water bodies, such as ponds, are essential elements of human
   socio-economic landscapes. Ponds also provide important habitats for
   species that would otherwise not survive in the urban environment.
   Knowledge on the biodiversity of urban ponds and the relationship
   between their ecological value and factors linked to urbanization and
   socio-economic status is crucial for decisions on where and how to
   establish and manage ponds in cities to deliver maximum biodiversity
   benefits. Our study investigates if the pattern of urban-pond
   biodiversity can be related to different socio-economic factors, such as
   level of wealth, education or percentage of buildings of different
   types. Because of lack of previous studies investigating that, our study
   is of exploratory character and many different variables are used. We
   found that the biodiversity of aquatic insects was significantly
   negatively associated with urbanisation variables such as amount of
   buildings and number of residents living around ponds. This relationship
   did not differ depending on the spatial scale of our investigation. In
   contrast, we did not find a significant relationship with variables
   representing socio-economic status, such as education level and wealth
   of people. This latter result suggests that the socio-economic status of
   residents does not lead to any particular effect in terms of the
   management and function of ponds that would affect biodiversity.
   However, there is a need for a finer-scale investigation of the
   different potential mechanism in which residents in areas with differing
   socio-economic status could indirectly influence ponds.},

Volume = {36},
Pages = {262-272},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In light of increased development pressure in rural landscapes,
   understanding how amenity migrants understand and experience nature is a
   vital project for rural studies. This paper investigates how residents
   living in a rural residential estate (RRE) negotiate more-than-human
   encounters in domestic settings. RREs are emergent forms of
   master-planned residential development on the rural urban fringe,
   marketed and designed to meet an idyllic rural lifestyle. In the RRE,
   domestic nonhuman transgressions are both presumed as a part of the
   amenity migrant experience, and pre-empted by estate design and
   regulation. Border encounters in gardens were explored via
   semi-structured walking interviews with 27 residents of an RRE, located
   on the rural urban fringe of Sydney, Australia. Nonhuman transgressions
   were found to both contribute towards, and challenge, homemaking
   practices. Some residents expressed a vernacular ecology at home
   entangled with more-than-human company, where nonhumans are
   `neighbours'. Gardens were shared, and maintenance practices altered.
   When domestic expectations of cleanliness and order were challenged,
   native nonhumans were negotiated in gardens with a `hoped-for absence'
   (Ginn, 2014). These stories illustrate that a native politics of
   belonging foreshadows the homemaking practices of amenity migrants. The
   paper suggests settlements similar to RRE can be a positive intervention
   on the rural urban fringe, encouraging different registers of
   interaction with nonhuman nature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Socioecological features of plant diversity in domestic gardens in the
   city of Bogota, Colombia},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {54-62},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Domestic gardens contribute substantially to green spaces in cities,
   where urbanization removes and fragments natural landscapes, causing the
   loss of biodiversity and the homogenization of biota. We analyzed the
   diversity and composition of the flora of 70 domestic gardens in seven
   localities in Bogota, Colombia, which represent different periods of
   expansion of the city. Floristic composition and diversity were related
   to the origin and use of plants, the urbanization history, and the
   income of owners. We recorded 4110 individuals belonging to 238 species.
   The mean species richness per garden was 15.4, with older localities
   having significantly higher species richness. The similarity among the
   localities, which evaluated the distinctness of assemblages, ranged from
   0.42 to 0.50. Plants from the Neotropical region and exotic plants were
   the most abundant in all gardens. The most common use was ornamental,
   and use depended on the socioeconomic status of the owner. The
   lower-income homes cultivated larger proportions of edible and medicinal
   plants. Gardens at the oldest localities, with the largest number of
   native species, contribute to the conservation of flora because they
   contain the largest number of native species. Furthermore, domestic
   gardens are good sources of employment for gardeners and are useful
   places to keep senior citizens active, helping these citizens relieve
   stress, maintain good health and teach young people the cultural uses of
   plants. The receptivity of the homeowners to the study opens the door to
   future research and conservation programs in the city.},

Title = {Residential yards as designer ecosystems: effects of yard management on
   land snail species composition},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2536-2545},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Residential yards comprise the majority of green space in urban
   landscapes, yet are an understudied system because of access issues and
   because yards may be considered biologically depauperate. Yards are
   purposely created and managed and, hence, qualify as designer
   ecosystems, a term borrowed from restoration ecology. We investigated
   whether yard management (watering regime, mulching, and chemical use) or
   dog presence affected land snail assemblage composition and described
   the pattern of native vs. nonnative species among yards. Land snails
   form an appropriate model system for yard-scale studies because snails
   are speciose, common, and have limited mobility. We found 32 land snail
   species in our survey of 61 yards in Norman, Oklahoma, USA (population
   size of 118,000). Snail richness in individual yards averaged nine
   species, with a range of three to 14 species. Native snails were found
   in all yards and nonnative snails were found in all but one yard.
   Although some of the nine nonnative species were rare, the most
   frequently encountered species was the nonnative Triodopsis
   hopetonensis. All encountered nonnative species also occur in Oklahoma
   plant nurseries, indicating possible introduction through the plant
   trade. Yard-scale watering regime and the presence of dogs were
   associated with differences in snail species composition but not species
   richness. Pesticide use and mulch type had little, if any, association
   with snail composition. Effects may have been diluted by treating yards
   as units, whereas snails were concentrated in specific microhabitats,
   such as under shrubs. Soil type also influenced snail assemblages and
   acted at a scale larger than individual yards. Considering yards as
   designer ecosystems facilitates investigation of how local variation in
   management affects biota within yards and across the residential
   landscape, and highlights the importance of variation among residential
   yards in understanding patterns of urban biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Estimating the relative importance of vegetation on residential land
   (gardens, yards, and street-trees) and vegetation on non-residential
   land (parks and other large green spaces) is important so that competing
   options for urban conservation planning can be prioritized. We used data
   from an urban breeding-bird monitoring program to compare the relative
   effects vegetation on residential land and vegetation on non-residential
   land (both the amount and type of vegetation at local and landscape
   scales) on bird species richness and an index of conservation value for
   the bird community. We then estimated the realised relative benefit of
   managing the amount of vegetation on these two types of land (i.e., as
   alternative management options for promoting biodiversity), which might
   be achieved within the practical limits imposed by human population
   density. The local effects of increasing residential and non-residential
   vegetation amount were similar and positive on all measures of bird
   species richness and conservation value. Non-residential vegetation had
   an additional landscape-scale influence on bird diversity that
   residential vegetation did not. Options for managing the amount of
   non-residential vegetation appear to be more limited by high human
   population density than for managing the amount of residential
   vegetation. This suggests that there may be greater realised benefits to
   bird diversity from managing the amount of vegetation on residential
   land than from the more common focus of urban planning of managing
   vegetation on non-residential land.},

Abstract = {The combination of increasing numbers of people in cities, coupled with

   life. Participants wanted a variety of parks which would meet the range
   of their community's needs and provide habitat for wildlife. Proximity
   and frequent use of parks resulted in a sense of ownership and
   responsibility which led to concrete action, such as participation in
   ecological restoration of valued greenspaces. Providing high quality

   the extinction of experience by fostering positive personal experiences

Abstract = {Urbanization has resulted in deterioration of natural lands and
   extinction of indigenous species. Domestic gardens are neglected spots
   of plants biodiversity. This research aimed to assess domestic garden
   plants diversity, composition, distribution, and identify the conserved
   indigenous plant species in a heavily urbanized arid city. Domestic
   gardens within each district were randomly selected, visited, and
   surveyed. Cultivated plant species in gardens were identified and
   counted; their frequencies and abundance levels were calculated. Plant
   species richness, Shannon, evenness, and Simpson's indices were
   calculated. More than 12,000 plants belonging to 223 plant species
   compromising 72 plant families were found. Domestic gardens played a
   significant role in conserving regionally extinct or endangered native
   plant species while undesirably sustained exotic and invasive plants.
   Overall, exotic plants species represented 84\% of all identified
   species. The highest percentage of native plants (29\%) was found in
   Uhod district, while the lowest (11\%) was in Jubaiha district. The
   minimum and maximum proportion of medicinal, poisonous, and fruit
   bearing plants on a district bases were 9-26\%, 9-22\%, and 11-43\% of
   domestic garden plants, respectively. The highest species richness (103)
   was in Zahran, while the lowest (20) was in Al-Madinah district. Shannon
   diversity index was the highest in Zahran and Sweileh districts.
   Shannon, evenness, and Simpson diversity indexes revealed Badr
   Al-Jadidah as the lowest plant diversity district. District history,
   lots sizes, garden sizes, socioeconomic status, residents' preferences,
   and housing regulations resulted in variation in plants diversity and
   species composition. Thus, monitoring species composition in domestic
   gardens and raising public awareness about plants benefits/risks
   supports environmental sustainability. Attention should be given to
   these neglected biodiversity hotspots, especially in arid environments.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {290},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Whether or not people believe killing snakes is morally acceptable
   affects the likelihood of harming them. An alternative is translocation,
   wherein snakes are relocated to nearby habitat. In our study based in
   semi-arid Phoenix, Arizona (USA), we examine residents' normative
   beliefs about killing snakes across different situations. Analyzing data
   from two survey samples-one of clients who paid for translocation and
   another of residents broadly, we assess if clients exhibit greater
   opposition to killing snakes and more positive attitudes toward them
   compared to the sample of residents, potentially indicating that
   translocation decisions might be intended as acts of conservation.
   Lastly, we address: to what extent do varied attitudes toward snakes,
   experiences with snakes, and socio-demographics influence people's
   beliefs about killing snakes overall and across distinct contexts: on
   private property and in residential homes or yards, as well as anytime,
   in desert habitat, and if someone is bitten? Our analyses demonstrate
   that residents substantially oppose killing snakes, although normative
   beliefs vary by context. Additionally, the client sample was more
   opposed to killing snakes and expressed more positive attitudes than
   residents broadly. Although disgust and other attitudes explain norms
   generally, different attitudes and socio-demographics affect norms
   depending on the context. Finally, although more frequent experiences
   with snakes did not impact norms in our analyses, experiences with
   snakes did increase positive attitudes toward them. Based on our
   findings, we recommend experiential learning to enhance appreciation of
   snakes and call for more research on the outcomes of translocations to
   ensure these decisions aid snake conservation.},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Japanese gardens play an important role in the conservation of bryophyte
   diversity. Previous studies have indicated that diverse garden
   landscapes and their maintenance as well as garden microclimates can be
   related to high bryophyte diversity, although it has not been examined
   how these microclimates differ from those in other land use types and
   how they affect bryophyte diversity. Therefore, this study analyzed the
   relationships among microclimate, garden landscape, and bryophyte
   diversity. The study sites comprised the renowned Saihoji Temple in
   Kyoto, Japan, and surrounding residential areas and forests. Seventeen
   1-m-radius circular plots were established within the study sites, and
   bryophyte species richness and cover, landscape elements, and
   microclimates (temperature and relative humidity) were recorded in these
   plots. Sixty-seven species were identified, including four endangered
   species, and garden plots showed higher species richness and cover than
   surrounding areas. Garden microclimates were characterized by
   significantly lower temperature and higher relative humidity, which can
   be attributed to a combined influence of garden elements such as large
   vegetation cover and water surface. Notably, these microclimates can
   significantly and positively affect bryophyte diversity by mitigating
   drought stress. Thus, Japanese gardens featuring large vegetation cover
   and water surface can function as conservation sites for
   drought-sensitive species, increasing urban bryophyte diversity.
   Conservation of bryophytes might be beneficial to urban biodiversity and
   resilience reinforcement by promoting biological interactions among
   several species and improving ecological functions.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {647},
Pages = {420-430},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Urban expansion is correlated to negative biodiversity trends. The
   amount of impervious surfaces in urban areas is a determinant of
   pollinator species assemblages. While the increase in urbanization and
   impervious surfaces negatively impacts pollinators, cities also
   encompass urban green spaces, which have a significant capacity to
   support biodiversity. Among them, domestic gardens that represent a
   non-negligible fraction of green spaces have been shown to benefit
   pollinators. Domestic gardens may form habitat clusters in residential
   areas, although their value at a landscape scale is still unknown. Here,
   we investigate the combined effects of impervious surfaces and domestic
   garden areas on pollinator richness. Due to the difficulty of accessing
   privately owned domestic gardens, we chose to use citizen science data
   from a well-established French citizen science program known as SPIPOLL.
   Using regression tree analysis on buffers located from 50m to 1000m
   around the data points, we show the importance of pollinators being in
   close proximity to domestic gardens as locally favorable habitats that
   are embedded within a landscape, in which impervious surfaces represent
   unfavorable areas. We highlight the inter-connection between local and
   landscape scales, the potential for patches of domestic gardens in
   residential areas, and the need to consider the potential of gardeners'
   coordinated management decisions within a landscape context. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Domestic gardens offer immense potential as sites for native

   Gardens proved to be very important for our householders: for physical
   and mental health, as an expression of ownership and identity, as sites
   for social relationships, for connecting with nature and as site of
   domestic produce production. Householders' connections with nature were
   idiosyncratic, multifaceted and exhibited in ways that are more complex

Abstract = {Food availability is a primary driver of avian population regulation.
   However, few studies have considered the effects of what is essentially
   a massive supplementary feeding experiment: the practice of wild bird
   feeding. Bird feeding has been posited as an important factor
   influencing the structure of bird communities, especially in urban
   areas, although experimental evidence to support this is almost entirely
   lacking. We carried out an 18-mo experimental feeding study at 23
   residential properties to investigate the effects of bird feeding on
   local urban avian assemblages. Our feeding regime was based on
   predominant urban feeding practices in our region. We used monthly bird
   surveys to compare avian community composition, species richness, and
   the densities of local species at feeding and nonfeeding properties.
   Avian community structure diverged at feeding properties and five of the
   commonest garden bird species were affected by the experimental feeding
   regime. Introduced birds particularly benefitted, with dramatic
   increases observed in the abundances of house sparrow (Passer
   domesticus) and spotted dove (Streptopelia chinensis) in particular. We
   also found evidence of a negative effect on the abundance of a native
   insectivore, the grey warbler (Gerygone igata). Almost all of the
   observed changes did not persist once feeding had ceased. Our study
   directly demonstrates that the human pastime of bird feeding
   substantially contributes to the structure of avian community in urban
   areas, potentially altering the balance between native and introduced
   species.},

   significantly higher in peripheral suburban areas than central business
   districts; however, there were no significant differences in the mean

   suburban areas or botanical gardens and central business districts.
   Urban residents were unlikely to have seen bees but agreed that bees
   have a right to exist in their natural environment. Residents who did

Year = {2015},
Volume = {157},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Reintroductions are commonly used to mitigate biodiversity loss. One
   prominent example is that of the Red Kite Milvus milvus, a charismatic
   raptor of conservation concern. This species has been reintroduced
   across the UK over the last 25years following its near extinction after
   centuries of persecution. The species was not expected to recolonize
   urban areas; its historical association with human settlements is
   attributed to scavenging on human waste and refuse, a resource now
   greatly reduced on the streets of modern European cities. However, the
   species has become a common daytime visitor to a large conurbation
   centred on the town of Reading, southern England, approximately 20km
   from the first English reintroduction site. Given a near-absence of
   breeding and roost sites, we investigated foraging opportunities and
   habitat associations that might explain use by Red Kites of this urban
   area. Surveys of discarded human foods and road-kill suggested that
   these could support at most 13-29 Kites per day. Face-to-face surveys of
   a cross-section of residents revealed that 4.5\% (equivalent to 4349
   households) provided supplementary food for Red Kites in their gardens.
   Using estimates of per-household resource provision from another study,
   we calculated that this is potentially sufficient to feed 142-320 Kites,
   a substantial proportion of the total estimated to visit the conurbation

Abstract = {Urbanization causes severe environmental degradation and continues to
   increase in scale and intensity around the world, but little is known
   about how we should design cities to minimize their ecological impact.
   With a sprawling style of urban development, low intensity impact is
   spread across a wide area, and with a compact form of development
   intense impact is concentrated over a small area; it remains unclear
   which of these development styles has a lower overall ecological impact.
   Here, we compare the consequences of compact and sprawling urban growth
   patterns on bird distributions across the city of Brisbane, Australia.
   We predicted the impact on bird populations of adding 84 642 houses to
   the city in either a compact or sprawling design using statistical
   models of bird distributions. We show that urban growth of any type
   reduces bird distributions overall, but compact development
   substantially slows these reductions at the city scale. Urban-sensitive
   species particularly benefited from compact development at the city
   scale because large green spaces were left intact, whereas the
   distributions of nonnative species expanded as a result of sprawling
   development. As well as minimizing ecological disruption, compact urban
   development maintains human access to public green spaces. However,
   backyards are smaller, which impacts opportunities for people to
   experience nature close to home. Our results suggest that cities built
   to minimize per capita ecological impact are characterized by high
   residential density, with large interstitial green spaces and small
   backyards, and that there are important trade-offs between maintaining
   city-wide species diversity and people's access to biodiversity in their
   own backyard.},

Abstract = {I walk fantastically with the cows along the stock route of the former

   Melbourne, Australia. I challenge the practice of heritage conservation
   as a closed story of the past `as it was', which projects a set of
   sanitised meanings that allow for neither subtext nor counter readings.
   I problematise the concrete machine of heritage protection utilising
   Deleuze and Guattari's ideas of faciality, where reassuring mosaic faces
   of cows going to the saleyards belong, but anguished faces of cows at
   the slaughterhouse do not. I call upon the cow's face as potential probe
   head to forge connections between past-present-future in hot heritage
   practices which challenge people to question their values and actions.
   Rediscovery of the cow beneath the face at Newmarket saleyards and
   abattoirs could intervene in people's habitual patterns of thinking and
   acting, triggering renegotiation of cultural meanings of ethics,
   welfare, and rights, regarding not only nonhuman animals, but also
   Othered humans, such as those penned in detention centres. Through
   experiential experiment rather than controlled interpretation, hot

Abstract = {The contemporary renaissance of urban agriculture is crucially linking
   ecological and social systems in modern cityscapes. Community gardens
   contribute ecological (biodiversity conservation) and social (food
   security) benefits to urban residents and enhance landscape
   multifunctionality. Cities have been recently labeled ``novel

   and biophysical elements. We conceptualize community garden soils within
   the novel ecosystem framework, arguing that gardeners are cultivating
   novel agroecosystems starting from their garden beds' soil. Although
   urban soil characteristics are linked to land-use legacies in most urban
   ecosystems, we find that in our system, the California central coast,
   community-garden soils may live outside the influence of legacies
   associated with geographic location. Instead, the intensive (re) working
   of soils by gardeners may washout legacy signals and decadal
   chronological trends, leading to soil homogenization that reduces the
   biophysical ties to the meters of earth below. Thus, socioecological
   novelty can be created in multiple forms in cities.},

Abstract = {As our world becomes increasingly urbanized, cities are often where we
   come into contact with the natural world-not just in parks and urban
   nature preserves, but in more familiar places like residential yards. We
   conducted bird surveys and social surveys in Chicago-area residential
   landscapes near forest preserves (primarily in middle- and high-income
   areas) to examine residents' perceptions of the birds that co-inhabit
   their neighborhoods and the relationship of those perceptions with
   characteristics of the bird community. We found that residents value
   many aspects of neighborhood birds, especially those related to
   aesthetics and birds' place in the ecosystem. Our results indicate that
   while birds were generally well liked and annoyances were minor, several
   common and visible urban species, such as the House Sparrow (Passer
   domesticus), European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris), and Blue Jay
   (Cyanocitta cristata), may attract attention for their negative
   qualities, such as their sounds and effects on personal property. The
   results also indicate that residents' valuations of ecosystem services
   are linked to their perceptions of bird species richness rather than the
   actual species richness, and people may perceive only a subset of the
   birds in their neighborhoods. Although birds provide many important
   ecosystem services, perhaps one of their most important roles in cities
   is as a relatable and likable connecting point between city dwellers and
   the broader environment.},

Abstract = {Long-term and widespread monitoring programs are essential to
   understanding the role of human-dominated landscapes in supporting wild
   bee populations. Urbanization results in increased impervious surfaces
   throughout the landscape, fragmentation of green space, and a loss of
   naturally occurring floral vegetation. All of these changes have a
   negative impact on pollinator diversity. The objective of this study was
   to assess the abundance and richness of wild bee species throughout a
   small city in northwest Pennsylvania and identify how management of land
   throughout the city may influence bee communities. Seventeen sites
   across a land use gradient, moving from areas with large open spaces and
   mainly permeable surfaces, to sites in the city center consisting of
   mainly impermeable surfaces, were sampled over a 2-year period. During
   this time, 106 known species were identified with four state records and
   1 undescribed species. Bee species richness was greatest at sites with
   the largest amount of permeable surface and naturally-occurring, native
   vegetation. Richness decreased on the college campus and city center
   where landscapes were highly managed and impermeable surfaces were most
   abundant. While floral richness was not related to bee abundance and
   richness, the number of open blooms near traps did have a positive
   impact on bee species richness. Overall, this survey revealed
   considerable richness never before recorded for northwest Pennsylvania,
   suggesting the importance of conservation management in homeowner and
   community yard space.},

Title = {To mow or to mow less: Lawn mowing frequency affects bee abundance and
   diversity in suburban yards},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {221},
Pages = {160-174},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Green spaces embedded within the urban matrix, particularly residential
   yards, could mitigate negative aspects of urban development and provide
   pollinator habitat. Lawns represent a dominant green space, and their
   management consists of frequent mowing to inhibit the growth of
   ostensibly ``weedy{''} species (e.g., dandelions and clover). Since
   widespread population declines of bees and other pollinators from
   habitat loss are a growing concern, these spontaneous flowers could
   provide pollen and nectar sources throughout the growing season. We
   experimentally tested whether different lawn mowing frequencies (1, 2 or
   3 weeks) influenced bee abundance and diversity in 16 suburban western
   Massachusetts yards by increasing lawn floral resources. Lawns mowed
   every three weeks had as much as 2.5 times more lawn flowers than the
   other frequencies. Interestingly, lawns mowed every two weeks supported
   the highest bee abundance yet the lowest bee richness and evenness. We
   suggest these patterns were driven by a combination of more abundant
   floral resources (compared with 1-week yards), easier access to lawn
   flowers due to shorter grass and a more drastic impact on grass biomass
   and floral resources (compared with 3-week yards), and the dominance of
   a few generalist bees overwhelming our samples, thus driving richness
   and evenness. Our results highlight a ``lazy lawnmower{''} approach to
   providing bee habitat. Mowing less frequently is practical, economical,
   and a timesaving alternative to lawn replacement or even planting
   pollinator gardens. Given the pervasiveness of lawns coupled with
   habitat loss, our findings provide immediate solutions for individual
   households to contribute to urban conservation.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-79},

Abstract = {Given that rates of urbanization are rising globally, the need to
   maintain and enhance urban biodiversity has become important. This study
   examines the relative influence of different land-use types as well as
   environmental resources (trees, flowering trees, fruiting trees, shrubs,
   telecommunication mast, pylons, electric poles, buildings) on bird
   diversity indicators in a rapidly developing urban settlement in Ghana.
   Remote sensing was used to estimate the extent of conversion of natural
   habitats into urban settlements. Using point count surveys, bird species
   were recorded and compared in randomly selected plots of four land-use
   types of farmlands, remnant forest, residential and commercial areas. We
   further evaluated the relative influence of habitat resources on bird
   diversity indicators. We found a significant expansion of built-up areas
   into natural habitats in the study area. Also, there has been a
   significant increase in sparse vegetation coupled with a drop in the
   area covered by dense vegetation over the last three decades. Avifauna
   diversity indicators differ significantly across the four land-use types
   with urban farmlands being the most species diverse, followed by urban
   remnant forests, then residential and finally commercial areas. Our
   findings suggest that avian species diversity indicators decreased
   significantly with increasing land-use intensity and revealed that the
   study area still possesses significant conservation potentials for urban
   birds and by extension biological diversity as long as vegetation
   fragments are maintained within a sustained urban expansion framework.
   We propose increasing the quantity and complexity of the vegetation
   cover in residential areas by supporting citizens to establish private
   yards to increase the city's green network.},

Abstract = {As urbanization increases, the identification of nest predators becomes
   important for avian conservation and management of urban wildlife
   communities. We investigated bird nest predation using artificial nests
   in urban areas of the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province of South Africa. From
   June 2013 through February 2014 we installed seventy-five artificial
   nests in 25 suburban gardens in the Ethekwini and Msunduzi
   municipalities of KZN. Euplectes spp. nests were used and baited with
   two quail-sized, hand-made, silicon eggs. These were placed in
   residential gardens and monitored by camera traps for 2-weeks in winter,
   spring and summer respectively. Generally bird nesting occurs throughout
   the year in KZN's subtropical climate, with some avoidance during the
   autumn season. Therefore, experiments were not conducted during autumn,
   as fresh nests were not available for use. Overall the rate of predation
   on artificial nests was 25 \% (n = 19), with vervet monkeys Ceropithecus
   aethiops pygerythrus predating 20 \% (n = 17) of the nests while
   domestic cats Felis catus predated 3 \% (n = 2) of nests. Nest predation
   was significantly higher in the winter season, with 79 \% of
   depredations occurring in winter (n = 15), 16 \% in spring (n = 3) and 5
   \% in summer (n = 1), and in areas with less canopy cover. Our results
   suggest that vervet monkeys may have a negative impact on nesting birds
   in urban environments, however, in order to assess the rate of predation
   experiments on natural nests coupled with information on fledgling
   success is deemed necessary to investigate avian population declines.},

   Motivations and preferences that guide the floristic composition of a
   little-explored space},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {63},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Plant diversity in large cities has recently become a subject of intense
   biological research. Urban green spaces are widely acknowledged to
   improve people's quality of life. Unlike in wild areas, plants in urban
   ecosystems develop in spaces strongly managed by human activity and tend
   to form different compositions than the natural landscape. Under this
   scenario, would the motivations and preferences of urbanresidents make
   it possible to conserve a sample of the local diversity in these spaces?
   To answer this question, we apply a semistructured survey to 100 homes
   that have a residential sidewalk garden in Santiago de Chile. Our
   results show that these gardens are perceived as an essential part of
   the home and its environment. We recognized three groups of citizens,
   namely, a utilitarian group (19 \%), native group (21 \%) and neutral
   group (60 \%). The utilitarian group prefers to grow useful plants, such
   as for medicine or food. The neutral group does not indicate a
   preference for particular attributes of plants, which could be an
   indicator of the extinction of the experience with nature. Most of the
   participants do not know the origin of the species they grow.However,
   even when knowledge of native flora is limited (X = 0.96; max = 3.0),
   citizens recognize the intrinsic value of these species and would be
   willing to conserve them in their gardens (X = 4.35; max = 7.0). This
   willingness is also motivated by the set of benefits provided by native
   plants (e.g., ornamental, ecological, structural or emotional). Greater
   knowledge of native flora in the native group can be attributed to
   familiarity; therefore, the presence of these species in residential
   sidewalk gardens could encourage preferences and decisions aimed at
   promoting the conservation of local plant diversity.},

   anthropological researchers, Ailan Awareness has designed an approach to
   marine conservation informed by the growing field of decolonial research
   practices. By working to empower coastal communities to make decisions
   about their marine and cultural resources using a mix of Indigenous,
   anthropological and scientific methods and giving primacy to
   strengthening Indigenous modes of knowledge production and the role of
   community Elders, Ailan Awareness addresses a major gap in the efforts

Title = {Maintaining experiences of nature as a city grows},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Experiences of nature contribute to human health and well-being, yet as
   the world's population continues to concentrate in towns and cities
   there is mounting concern that these experiences are diminishing.
   Despite this, little is known about how we can maintain experiences of
   nature as cities grow. Here, we quantify how people's opportunities to
   experience nature might change with future urban growth in the city of
   Brisbane, Australia. We simulated the addition of 84,642 houses under
   compact and sprawling growth scenarios and modeled changes in people's
   opportunities to experience nature by estimating changes in backyard
   size, public green space provision, and bird species richness close to
   households. We discovered that the form of urban growth could strongly
   influence people's opportunities to experience nature in a way that is
   highly nonrandom across the socioeconomic gradient. Under a sprawling
   pattern of development, with low residential densities and few
   interstitial green spaces, our models suggest severe declines in access
   to public green space and bird species richness around people's homes.
   These declines are predicted to be concentrated in socioeconomically
   disadvantaged areas of the city. Compact development leads to greater
   reductions in backyard size, but smaller declines in access to public
   green space and bird species richness. Our results point to a difficult
   trade-off; residential infill will maintain larger green spaces and
   higher overall bird diversity but reduce backyard sizes, impacting
   people's opportunities to experience nature in a different way. Careful
   planning is needed to balance the availability of public and private
   urban green spaces to ensure that the opportunities for people to
   experience nature are maintained as urbanization continues.},

Title = {Legacy effects and landscape choices in a desert city},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {165},
Pages = {22-29},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Lawns are a traditional landscape choice in urban neighborhoods, and
   their pervasiveness results in extensive irrigation around the world.
   Focusing on the semi-arid metropolis of Phoenix, Arizona, this paper
   examines residents' actual and preferred landscapes for both front and
   back yards; specifically considering grass (mesic) yards, gravel-based
   (xeric) yards, and mixed (oasis) yards that include some grass and some
   gravel. Since xeric yards can conserve water, practitioners have
   promoted them as a drought-tolerant alternative to traditional lawns.
   Understanding the factors that motivate or constrain landscaping choices
   can facilitate the transition from lawns toward more naturalistic
   alternatives. This paper provides an original analysis of how legacies
   in the Phoenix region including local landscape traditions and
   development history affect yard choices. Using survey data and
   inferential statistics, we found that longer-term residents as measured
   by the proportion of a resident's lifetime spent in the Phoenix region
   more often chose grassy landscapes compared to newcomers. This is
   counter to the common assumption that newcomers to the desert prefer
   lawns; instead, long-time residents seem to be accustomed to the
   long-established luxuriant landscapes of `the Phoenix Oasis.' Residents
   of older neighborhoods also chose grassier landscaping compared to
   residents in newer areas, who tended to choose xeric yards. Altogether,
   these findings reflect the lasting legacies that previous landscaping
   choices have in urban environments, where changes in preferences and
   practices take time. Ultimately, the legacy effects of past choices
   often persist, thereby impeding efforts to promote drought-tolerant and
   naturalistic landscapes.},

   cross-sectional study of garden owners in northern Belgium},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {223},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Urban green spaces and the biodiversity therein have been associated
   with human health and well-being benefits, but the contribution of
   domestic gardens to those benefits is insufficiently known.
   Using data from a cross-sectional sample (n = 587) of domestic garden
   owners in Flanders and Brussels (northern Belgium), associations between
   residential green space quality in and around domestic gardens, green
   space related activities and socioeconomic background variables of the
   gardeners, and self-reported health (stress and depression) were
   investigated with structural equation models.
   Socioeconomic security was associated with lower stress and depression.
   Nature relatedness and green space in the neighbourhood of the house
   were associated with higher exposure to green space, which was in turn
   negatively associated with stress and depression. Garden quality,
   indicated by biodiversity values and size, and nature relatedness were
   associated with being active in the garden, which was in turn associated
   with lower values of depression, but not stress.
   Nature relatedness seems to play a key role in the pathway linking
   gardens to improved health. Improving biodiversity and ecosystems
   services in gardens may increase exposure to green space and help to
   restore and enhance nature relatedness. This, in turn, could potentially
   improve human health and well-being, and contribute to the conservation
   of biodiversity in urban environments.},

Title = {Linking yard plant diversity to homeowners' landscaping priorities
   across the U.S},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {196},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Residential yards contribute to human well-being and urban biodiversity.
   The structure, diversity, and composition of yard floras are largely
   determined by personal choices and landscaping priorities at local
   scales, but it is unclear whether these relationships hold across
   broader geographical areas. We investigated the relationship between
   homeowners' criteria for vegetation and yard management choices,
   ecosystem-service based traits, and yard plant diversity (i.e.,
   taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional) in 145 yards distributed across
   6 major cities in the U.S. Individual priorities for a set of ecosystem
   services were collected with closed-ended questions and reduced into
   four main principal components using factor analyses: natural, neat,
   showy and low cost. Across cities, priorities for neat yards were
   negatively related to overall and spontaneous species richness.
   Priorities for showy yards were positively related to yard aesthetics
   (based on showiness of flowers, fruits and leaves for component plants)
   and spontaneous species richness. Homeowners that preferred low-cost
   yards had a significantly higher proportion of exotics, and yards with
   significantly lower functional diversity (i.e., a composite measure for
   plant height, seed mass, and specific leaf area). The proportion of
   natives was not related to homeowners' priorities for natural yards and
   phylogenetic diversity was only weakly and negatively related to
   priorities for showy yards. Our study corroborates previous research
   showing that homeowners' landscaping priorities are only partially
   related to their yard vegetation at the continental scale. The
   disconnection might be attributed to broader institutional, structural,
   and ecological constraints that prevent people's personal ideals and
   priorities from being realized.},

Title = {Ultrasonic deterrents reduce nuisance cat (Felis catus) activity
   on suburban properties},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Urban environments are increasingly important for biodiversity
   conservation, but pet cats threaten wildlife therein, displaying
   nuisance behaviour such as hunting, fighting, fouling and urine
   spraying. In an attempt to empower landholders wishing to reduce cat
   incursions humanely, we tested the effectiveness of two ultrasonic cat
   deterrents (CatStop (c) and On-Guard Mega-Sonic Cat Repeller (c)).
   After confirming in arena trials that cats detect and respond negatively
   to an ultrasonic device, we tested both deterrents in 18 suburban
   gardens in Perth, Western Australia. Camera monitoring at foci of cat
   activity (e.g. fish ponds, property entry/exit points) occurred for two
   weeks before (Period 1: device off), during (Period 2: device on) and
   after (Period 3: device off) the activation of deterrents. Data included
   individual cat demographics and behaviours, number of cat detections per
   site per day per sampling period, the duration of cat activity, and
   detection of non-target species.
   Seventy-eight unique cats were detected at 17 of 18 garden sites (2-9
   cats/garden). Over half the cats could be sexed (56.4\%, with 65.1\%
   males). Nearly 53.0\% of cats were confirmed to be pets living nearby.
   Cats that were most active in period 1 (>= 100 s total activity
   duration) were classified as `residents'; all others were `peripherals'.
   Overall, the ultrasonic deterrents reduced the frequency of incursions
   into gardens by resident cats by 46\%, while the duration of incursions
   was reduced by 78\%. Cat activity declined significantly from period 1
   (baseline) to period 2 for resident cats but not peripheral cats (50\%
   reduction; p = 0.001), and remained depressed in period 3 for resident
   cats but not peripheral cats (p < 0.001). Peripheral cat activity
   remained at an unchanging low level across all three periods. Males were
   slightly more active than females over the experiment (p = 0.04), but
   sexes did not vary in response to deterrents (p > 0.05). Cats confirmed
   as owned (53\% of cats) generated more activity than cats of unknown
   ownership status (p = 0.03), probably reflecting proximity of their
   residences to trial gardens. Both deterrent models had similar effects
   (p = 0.89).
   By allowing pets to roam, cat owners are complicit in cat nuisance. This
   requires public education. Ultrasonic deterrents offer a cost-effective,
   humane option to reduce incursions by unwanted cats. Ultrasonic
   deterrents will not prevent all incursions, but they reduce their
   frequency and duration. Reduced cat activity has flow-on benefits to
   wildlife across a variety of urban-suburban settings, including gardens
   and parks. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Insect pollinator populations, critical to the global food supply, are
   declining. Research has found robust bee communities in cities, which
   are supported by diverse urban habitat and foraging resources.
   Accounting for 35-50\% of urban green space, U.S. private residential
   yards can serve as important forage and nesting sources for pollinators.
   Incorporating wild attributes and wildness, such as native vegetation
   and less intensive yard-management practices, is key. However, urban
   vegetation, and its effects on local native bee populations, is shaped
   by social and cultural preferences, norms, aesthetics, values, and
   identities. The perfect lawn ideal of a highly manicured turfgrass yard
   dominates neighborhood landscapes and is often at odds with the habitat
   needs of pollinators. As part of a three-year study investigating the
   sociocultural drivers of residential vegetation choices in St. Louis,
   MO, USA, we interviewed 85 decisionmakers in order to understand choices
   about private residential yard maintenance. This paper presents an
   emergent finding concerning how residents conceptualize and talk about
   the urban-yard aesthetic, using the terms ``wild `` and ``wildness ``,
   which reflect a range of levels in the demand for urban wild spaces in
   their neighborhoods. The discourse of wildness offers a nontechnical
   route for understanding the connections between the ecological
   consequences of urbanization, with human attitudes towards nature that
   shape the biological functioning of human-generated habitats.},

Pages = {115-123},

Abstract = {Community-driven vertical greenery provides a previously
   under-appreciated resource that could be an important component of
   tropical urban ecology. While the corridors of buildings have been
   designed to facilitate the circulation of residents between spaces, this
   study shows that such corridors incidentally served as an informal space
   for community-driven vertical greenery. Across 1.86 ha of surveyed
   corridors, a total of 265 plant species and cultivars were present, with
   an average richness of 124 species per hectare. This is beneficial to
   urban ecology through its high species diversity, occurrence of
   endangered and vulnerable native species. Based on a classification of
   specific plant attributes referenced from literature, provision of food
   and medicinal resources (77.5\%), and aesthetic benefits (72.3\%) were
   the key ecosystem services provided by the species present.
   Community-driven vertical greenery could function as refugia for native
   species of conservation interest through providing an additional buffer
   against further losses in the wild. It also provides immediate
   opportunities for interactions between humans and nature. This study
   finds that corridors with larger areas and simpler geometries typically
   hold a higher abundance of plant pots. Future efforts to increase the
   abundance and diversity of vertical greenery, and its concomitant
   increase in the provision of ecosystem services, could be driven by
   local communities, rather than be formally planned by landscape
   architects, engineers and urban planners.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Islands are well-known as particular and vulnerable ecosystems with
   evolutionary histories, environmental characteristics, and original
   communities different from those of continents. On the contrary, urban
   environments are recent, artificial, and structurally similar among
   distant regions. To assess the relative importance of regional and local
   processes on urban biota, we chose two urban environments, i.e., one on
   the mainland and another on an island in the same ecoregion. We asked
   whether the urbanization process affects the avian biodiversity of the
   ISLAND in the same way as in the continent. We defined an urban gradient
   with three levels of building density, namely, patches of native
   vegetation (remnant woodlands in the urban matrix), medium density
   urbanized areas that maintain vegetation along the streets and gardens,
   and residential areas with less vegetation cover and higher building
   density. In each geographical locality, we selected three sites
   (replicates) for each level of the urban gradient and did bird surveys.
   We found two times as many species in the urban landscape of the
   continent (69) as on the island (35), with the analogous richness
   decrease along the gradient in both regions. Species similarity was
   higher between urbanized sites of both regions compared with the
   similarity between woodlands and urbanized sites, showing that urban
   matrix filters similar species of each pool regionally. Individual
   species responded to urban structure in different ways. We found 32\% of
   bird species were urban exploiters, 48\% urban tolerant, and 20\% urban
   avoiders in both regions. However, some species showed different
   frequencies of occurrence on the island and the continent. Species
   turnover contributed more than richness differences to species
   dissimilarity along the urban gradient on the continent. Contrarily, the
   nestedness component (i.e., species being a strict subset of the species
   at a richer site) was higher on the island. We concluded that the
   negative impact of highly urbanized areas on birds was stronger on the
   island than on the continent. Our results may help to assess the
   implications of beta-diversity loss, especially on islands.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {141},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Vegetation-covered urban brownfields provide a number of ecosystem
   services to help tackle current urban challenges, such as preventing a
   loss of biodiversity, adapting to climate change, and fostering
   recreational and healthy urban environments. However, the potential
   benefits for urban areas can only be realized if such brownfields are
   accepted as vital elements of the urban green infrastructure. The paper
   addresses the potentials of different types of green urban brownfields
   to provide particular ecosystem services with an outstanding relevance
   for the urban environment and the life of local residents, and looks at
   how these services can be best exploited in urban areas. Based on
   literature reviews, climate modeling, and a survey, research findings
   are presented on habitat services, microclimatic regulation services,
   and recreational services for various types of green urban brownfields.
   Differences in the quantity and quality of these services can be stated
   according to the specific and varying vegetation inventory and
   structural parameters of green urban brownfields. Scenario modeling of
   the preservation and development or transformation of brownfields into
   green spaces are used to illustrate the potentials and trade-offs of
   land-use changes in urban environments. Additionally, the provision of
   ecosystem services is influenced by the different options of green
   spaces for reusing brownfields. The paper closes with a discussion of
   some approaches to implementing these findings in urban realities. (C)

Abstract = {One of the contemporary challenges facing urban areas is the necessity
   to identify novel approaches to resident involvement in solution
   creation, with a particular focus on ensuring the best possible
   nutrition. By investigating the process of co-participation of city
   dwellers in a unique education project, this paper aims to gain a deeper
   understanding of the health-related motivations that underpin the
   decision of early adopters of the implemented technological innovations
   to join the social experiment. The qualitative study employed purposive
   sampling and in-depth interviews conducted in two waves, the first
   between October and November 2022 and the second between September 2023
   and January 2024. The study comprised 42 participants drawn from two
   communities of residents in \& Lstrok;\& oacute;d \& zacute; and Warsaw,
   Poland. Transcriptions of the interviews were carried out using semantic
   field analysis, employing a quantitative approach that counts the
   frequency of keyword occurrences. Three categories of semantic fields
   were identified: associations, oppositions, and actions toward the
   subject, including positive, neutral, and negative temperatures. The
   findings demonstrate that the health concerns of residents are a pivotal
   factor in their decision to participate in urban food self-production
   initiatives, given their limited access to nutritious and healthy
   vegetables. This is related to several factors, including restrictions
   related to urbanization and the displacement of local suppliers,
   lifestyle, and the fast pace of urban life. The dissemination of
   innovative solutions for growing food in urban environments could,
   therefore, facilitate awareness-raising and motivation to alter the

Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-53},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The European honeybee Apis mellifera is a highly successful, abundant
   species and has been introduced into habitats across the globe. As a
   supergeneralist species, the European honeybee has the potential to
   disrupt pollination networks, especially in Australia, whose flora and
   fauna have co-evolved for millions of years. The role of honeybees in
   pollination networks in Australia has been little explored and has never
   been characterised in urban areas, which may favour this exotic species
   due to the proliferation of similarly exotic plant species which this
   hyper-generalist can utilise, unlike many native bee taxa. Here, we use
   a bipartite network approach to compare the roles, in terms of
   species-level properties, of honeybees with native bee taxa in
   bee-flower ('pollination') networks in an urbanised biodiversity
   hotspot. We also assessed whether the abundance of honeybees influences
   overall network structure. Pollination networks were created from
   surveys across seven residential gardens and seven urban native
   vegetation remnants conducted monthly during the spring-summer period
   over two years. There were consistent differences in species-level
   properties between bee taxa, with honeybees often differing from all
   other native bees. Honeybees had significant impacts on network
   properties, being associated with higher nestedness, extinction slopes
   of plants, functional complementarity and niche overlap (year two), as
   well as lower weighted connectance and generalisation. These
   associations all are indicative that competition is occurring between
   the introduced honeybee and the native bee taxa in bee-flower networks.
   In conclusion, the introduced honeybee occupies a dominant, distinct
   position in bee-flower networks in urban habitats in the southwest
   Western Australian biodiversity hotspot and has a major, potentially
   disruptive, influence on plant-pollinator network properties in these
   areas.},

Title = {What's in a yardscape? A case study of emergent ecosystem services and
   disservices within resident yardscape discourses in Minnesota},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},

Number = {6},

Abstract = {Residential yardscapes are at the forefront of human interaction with
   nature for those living in urban areas across Europe and North America.
   In recent years a significant amount of research has investigated urban
   green spaces using the ecosystem services framework (ES) along with
   ecosystem disservices (ED) and how such spaces deliver urban ecosystem
   services (UES). However, a gap exists in understanding how ES and ED
   manifest themselves in the more specific context of residential
   yardscapes. Specifically, do homeowners conceptualize ES and ED when
   talking about their yards without specific prompts to reflect services
   and disservices? The current work presents a case study of homeowners in
   the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota, United States.
   We used two associated surveys to elicit responses related to
   homeowners' yards. Without prompting, homeowner conceptualizations of
   their yardscapes reflected all ES categories with cultural (CES) (e.g.,
   family recreation) and provisioning (PES) (e.g., vegetable cultivation)
   services cited most often. Homeowners also mentioned ED associated with
   their own or a neighbor's yard (e.g., attraction of nuisance wildlife).
   Their plans for yardscapes indicated largely incremental changes (e.g.,
   putting in a new planting bed) vs. drastic shifts (e.g., complete
   replacement of turfgrass with alternative vegetation). This case study
   illustrates that the homeowners' conceptualizations of their yards do
   indeed reflect current ES \& ED frameworks without specific prompting.
   The ES framework, combined with the identified leverage points, can be a
   fruitful approach for enhancing UES and minimizing ED within residential
   yardscapes.},

Title = {Biodiversity in urban gardens: Assessing the accuracy of citizen science
   data on garden hedgehogs},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {819-833},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Urban gardens provide a rich habitat for species that are declining in
   rural areas. However, collecting data in gardens can be
   logistically-challenging, time-consuming and intrusive to residents.
   This study examines the potential of citizen scientists to record
   hedgehog sightings and collect habitat data within their own gardens
   using an online questionnaire. Focussing on a charismatic species meant
   that the number of responses was high (516 responses were obtained in
   six weeks, with a similar to 50:50 \% split between gardens with and
   without hedgehog sightings). While many factors commonly thought to
   influence hedgehog presence (e.g. compost heaps) were present in many
   hedgehog-frequented gardens, they were not discriminatory as they were
   also found in gardens where hedgehogs were not seen. Respondents were
   most likely to have seen hedgehogs in their garden if they had also seen
   hedgehogs elsewhere in their neighbourhood. However, primary fieldwork
   using hedgehog `footprint tunnels' showed that hedgehogs were found to
   be just as prevalent in gardens in which hedgehogs had previously been
   reported as gardens where they had not been reported. Combining these
   results indicates that hedgehogs may be more common in urban and
   semi-urban gardens than previously believed, and that casual volunteer
   records of hedgehogs may be influenced more by the observer than by
   habitat preferences of the animal. When verified, volunteer records can
   provide useful information, but care is needed in interpreting these
   data.},

Title = {Joining Inventory by Parataxonomists with DNA Barcoding of a Large
   Complex Tropical Conserved Wildland in Northwestern Costa Rica},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Background: The many components of conservation through biodiversity
   development of a large complex tropical wildland, Area de Conservacion
   Guanacaste (ACG), thrive on knowing what is its biodiversity and natural
   history. For 32 years a growing team of Costa Rican parataxonomists has
   conducted biodiversity inventory of ACG caterpillars, their food plants,
   and their parasitoids. In 2003, DNA barcoding was added to the inventory
   process.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe some of the salient
   consequences for the parataxonomists of barcoding becoming part of a
   field biodiversity inventory process that has centuries of tradition.
   From the barcoding results, the parataxonomists, as well as other
   downstream users, gain a more fine-scale and greater understanding of
   the specimens they find, rear, photograph, database and deliver. The
   parataxonomists also need to adjust to collecting more specimens of what
   appear to be the ``same species{''} - cryptic species that cannot be
   distinguished by eye or even food plant alone while having to work with
   the name changes and taxonomic uncertainty that comes with discovering
   that what looked like one species may be many.
   Conclusions/Significance: These career parataxonomists, despite their
   lack of formal higher education, have proven very capable of absorbing
   and working around the additional complexity and requirements for
   accuracy and detail that are generated by adding barcoding to the field
   base of the ACG inventory. In the process, they have also gained a
   greater understanding of the fine details of phylogeny, relatedness,
   evolution, and species-packing in their own tropical complex ecosytems.
   There is no reason to view DNA barcoding as incompatible in any way with
   tropical biodiversity inventory as conducted by parataxonomists. Their
   year-round on-site inventory effort lends itself well to the sampling
   patterns and sample sizes needed to build a thorough barcode library.
   Furthermore, the biological understanding that comes with barcoding
   increases the scientific penetrance of biodiversity information, DNA
   understanding, evolution, and ecology into the communities in which the
   parataxonomists and their families are resident.},

Abstract = {Urbanization has intensified in developing countries in recent years,
   resulting in a large number of landless farmers. In China, 87 \% of them
   have relocated from scattered villages to collective housing. This study
   took Shanghai as a case to explore the differences in plant landscapes
   between farmers' settlement types. We randomly sampled 22 plots (made up
   of 294 subplots), consisting of five traditional villages and 17 modern
   quarters (four low-rise, six multilayer, four mixed-layer and three
   high-rise). Plant species composition and diversity were surveyed and
   analyzed. Results showed that: (a) villages had higher percentages of
   indigenous species, wild species and fruit and vegetable species than
   quarters, though there were lower species richness and Shannon'
   Diversity at villages than at quarters. (b) The defoliation ratio (based
   on the number of evergreen species to the number of deciduous species)
   was lower at villages than at quarters (0.73 vs. 1.21, respectively).
   (c) Metasequoia glyptostroboides (deciduous) was dominant species for
   villages and Osmanthus fragrans (evergreen) was dominant species for
   quarters, while Cinnamomum camphora (evergreen) was common dominant
   species for villages and quarters. Our research suggests that village
   landscape has advantages of the conservation of indigenous plant species
   and the relative balance between daylighting and greening adjacent to
   buildings. Furthermore, the highest species richness at low-rise
   quarters shows the advantage of multi-stakeholder participation of
   developers, property companies and resident farmers driving species
   diversity.},

Volume = {113},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Historically, urban developers, politicians, and public water utilities
   have invented Los Angeles as a semitropical oasis in a dry climate.
   During the California drought of 2011 through 2016, however, the city's
   residential gardens became a new frontier of water conservation policy.
   Water agencies started to subsidize the replacement of lushly irrigated
   lawns with California Friendly (R) landscapes, thereby endorsing a
   technology-centered ``infrastructuring{''} of gardens to increase water
   conservation. This approach contrasts with California native plant
   gardening promoted by nature conservationists, which uses vernacular
   horticultural techniques to restore native plant biodiversity and reduce
   irrigation. The article shows that each approach has important political
   implications for urban space and water use, the value accorded to nature
   and gardening work, and relations between citizens and experts.
   Analyzing the differences between these approaches, we critically
   interrogate Los Angeles's modern infrastructure regime that shapes water
   conservation policy. Particular attention is paid to how new material
   objects, knowledges, and practices in gardening recompose relationships
   between water, plants, technology, humans, and urban space. We argue
   that the notion of infrastructuring gardens offers a fruitful lens for
   ascertaining how expert cultures shape urban environmental change and
   how alternative gardening practices (re)produce urban nature
   differently.},

Abstract = {The eastern migratory monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus L.) population
   in North America hit record low numbers during the 2013-2014
   overwintering season, prompting pleas by scientists and conservation
   groups to plant the butterfly's milkweed host plants (Asclepias spp.) in
   residential areas. While planting butterfly gardens with host plants
   seems like an intuitive action, no previous study has directly compared
   larval survival in gardens and natural areas to demonstrate that gardens
   are suitable habitats for Lepidoptera. In this study, milkweed was
   planted in residential gardens and natural areas. In 2009 and 2010,
   plants were monitored for oviposition by monarch butterflies and
   survival of monarch eggs and caterpillars. Monarchs oviposited
   significantly more frequently in gardens than in natural sites, with 2.0
   and 6.2 times more eggs per plant per observation in 2009 and 2010,
   respectively. There were no significant differences in overall subadult
   survival between gardens and natural areas. Significant differences in
   survival were measured for egg and larval cohorts when analyzed
   separately, but these were not consistent between years. These results
   suggest that planting gardens with suitable larval host plants can be an
   effective tool for restoring habitat for monarch butterflies. If planted
   over a large area, garden plantings may be useful as a partial
   mitigation for dramatic loss of monarch habitat in agricultural
   settings.},

Abstract = {Tropical forest loss and transformation to agroecosystems have serious
   impacts on biodiversity, associated ecosystem services and the
   livelihood of local people. The high crop plant biodiversity and low
   intensity management in many homegardens could play an important role in
   the preservation of biodiversity in modified landscapes, as well as
   sustain food security of low income households. In this study, we
   focused on the role of the owner's cultural background as migrants (from
   the island of Java) or non-migrants (local residents) for homegarden
   characteristics, such as size, management diversification, and crop
   species richness, and their effect on arthropod communities in Jambi
   province, Indonesia. Vane traps, pitfall traps and sweep netting were
   used to survey the arthropod communities, in particular bees and wasps,
   in 24 homegardens. Our results show that the native Jambi locals used a
   smaller number of management practices and had smaller homegardens than
   the Javanese transmigrants, whereas crop species richness did not
   differ. Management diversification and crop species richness were
   positively related to arthropod abundance as well as species richness of
   bees and wasps, presumably due to the enhanced homegarden heterogeneity.
   Our findings suggest that the cultural practices of migrant versus
   non-migrant land-use managers, which is usually neglected in
   agroecology, can be a major determinant of management practices shaping
   community structure and services of beneficial arthropods.},

Abstract = {Municipal authorities around the world have come to recognize the
   importance of making conservation and restoration a priority. Multiple
   urban restoration programs now foster insects and other pollinators
   through planting and sowing flowering plants, many of them within
   residential areas. But residents are not only walking next to
   pollinators visiting flowering sidewalk grass verges, they are also
   walking on top of them, nesting in the cracks and interstices of urban
   pavements.Combining morphological and molecular monitoring schemes, we
   conducted a survey of urban pavements at twelve locations across Berlin
   and found that pavements can foster a surprising number and quantity of
   soil dwelling insects-in particular wild bees and wasps. Pavements
   located within 200 m to an insect-friendly flower garden were covered
   with significantly more nests of wild bees and solitary wasps, and
   showed higher species richness of these groups, while the degree of
   sealed surfaces in the surrounding had no effect per se. This underlines
   the positive impact that insect-friendly gardens can have for
   pollinators and other insects, even in highly sealed areas. Also, it
   shows the potential of cobbled pavements as valuable nesting sites in
   highly sealed urban areas. We provide a list of 55 species of
   ground-nesting Hymenoptera found in Berlin pavements, including 28
   species of wild bees and 22 apoid wasps. In our study, the molecular
   approach only detected three Hymenoptera species and did not yield
   comparable results to classical monitoring. Nonetheless, using eDNA
   methods might be a promising tool for further studying soil nesting
   insects in the future, and to gain insights into the web of life in

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {239-246},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Private yards provide city residents with access to ecosystem services
   that can be realized through passive (vegetation availability) and
   active (time spent in yards: frequency and duration) means. However,
   urban densification is leading to smaller yards with less vegetation.
   Here, we examine how urban form and socio-demographic factors affect the
   potential ecosystem service benefits people can gain via passive (e.g.
   climate regulation) and active (e.g. recreation) pathways. Two measures
   of vegetation cover (0.15-2 m, >2 m) are used as a proxy for passive
   ecosystem service benefits, and two measures of yard use (use frequency,
   total time spent across a week) are used for active ecosystem service
   benefits. We use survey and GIS data to measure personal and physical
   predictors that could influence these variables for 520 residents of
   detached housing in Brisbane, Australia. We found house age and yard
   size were positively correlated with vegetation cover, and people with a
   greater nature relatedness and lower socio-economic disadvantage also
   had greater vegetation cover. Yard size was an important predictor of
   yard use, as was nature relatedness, householder age, and presence of
   children in the home. Vegetation cover showed no relationship,
   indicating that greater cover alone does not promote ecosystem service
   delivery through the active use pathway. Together our results show that
   people who have higher nature relatedness may receive greater benefits
   from their yards via both passive and active means as they have more
   vegetation available to them in their yards and they interact with this
   space more frequently and for longer time periods. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {Multiple approaches to valuation of conservation design and low-impact
   development features in residential subdivisions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {101-113},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Residents, developers and civic officials are often faced with difficult
   decisions about appropriate land uses in and around metropolitan
   boundaries. Urban expansion brings with it the potential for negative
   environmental impacts, but there are alternatives, such as conservation
   subdivision design (CSD) or low-impact development (LID), which offer
   the possibility of mitigating some of these effects at the development
   site. Many urban planning jurisdictions across the Midwest do not
   currently have any examples of these designs and lack information to
   identify public support or barriers to use of these methods. This is a
   case study examining consumer value for conservation and low-impact
   design features in one housing market by using four different valuation
   techniques to estimate residents' willingness to pay for CSD and LID
   features in residential subdivisions.
   A contingent valuation survey of 1804 residents in Ames, IA assessed
   familiarity with and perceptions of subdivision development and used an
   ordered value approach to estimate willingness to pay for CSD and LID
   features. A majority of residents were not familiar with CSD or LID
   practices. Residents indicated a willingness to pay for most CSD and LID
   features with the exception of clustered housing. Gender, age, income,
   familiarity with LID practices, perceptions of attractiveness of
   features and the perceived effect of CSD and LID features on ease of
   future home sales were important factors influencing residents'
   willingness to pay. A hypothetical referendum measured willingness to
   pay for tax-funded conservation land purchases and estimated that a
   property tax of around \$50 would be the maximum increase that would
   pass.
   Twenty-seven survey respondents participated in a subsequent series of
   experimental real estate negotiations that used an experimental auction
   mechanism to estimate willingness to pay for CSD and LID features.
   Participants indicated that clustered housing (with interspersed
   preserved forest or open space areas), rain gardens, and neighborhood
   streams with a forested buffer were the features they were most willing
   to pay for. Participants were not willing to pay for neighborhood
   streams without buffers.
   Finally, a spatial hedonic price model using 2093 homes in Ames, IA was
   used to estimate the effect of public and private open space on housing
   values. The model indicated that presence of neighborhood
   association-owned forest and water features as well as proximity to
   public parks had significant positive effects on housing prices.
   However, proximity to a public lake had a negative effect on home
   values.
   The four methods used in this study include both stated and revealed
   preference techniques. Although the relative magnitude of value
   expressed varied, all methods indicated that residents value CSD and LID
   subdivision features. Subdivision features that included explicit
   environmental benefits were also consistently preferred over features
   that did not. Familiarity with alternative designs was an important
   factor influencing resident willingness to pay for neighborhood
   features, and developers and civic officials should consider ways to
   educate citizens about CSD and LID development techniques to increase
   interest in these designs. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The conservation of biological diversity in landscapes dominated by
   human use is emerging as an increasingly significant challenge, given
   the rate at which the Earth's remaining vegetation resources are being
   lost. Whilst traditional approaches to conservation have relied upon the
   ability of species to persist within the scattered fragments to which
   they have been confined, recent scientific evidence suggests that the
   long-term viability of fragmented populations may only be secured
   through the establishment of ecological connectivity between existing
   fragments.
   In the absence of a suitable methodology within which to design
   connective habitat configurations, a conceptual approach to landscape
   design was devised for a highly urbanised environment within the
   Shellharbour Local Government Area (LGA), New South Wales (NSW). This
   approach utilises beneficial landscape attributes advocated in the
   literature, and tailors existing rapid assessment methodologies
   traditionally used to provide simple measures of ecosystem health. Using
   this methodology, conservationally significant stepping-stone sites were
   identified between selected terminal habitat patches. The determination
   of an optimal corridor configuration linking these patches was found to
   heavily utilise riparian habitat and adjacent residential yard space.
   Planting endemic species in these areas will support ecological flow by
   increasing the area of core habitat relative to edge habitat. (c) 2008

Title = {Turnover in floral composition explains species diversity and temporal
   stability in the nectar supply of urban residential gardens},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Residential gardens are a valuable habitat for insect pollinators
   worldwide, but differences in individual gardening practices
   substantially affect their floral composition. It is important to
   understand how the floral resource supply of gardens varies in both
   space and time so we can develop evidence-based management
   recommendations to support pollinator conservation in towns and cities.
   We surveyed 59 residential gardens in the city of Bristol, UK, at
   monthly intervals from March to October. For each of 472 garden surveys,
   we combined floral abundances with nectar sugar data to quantify the
   nectar production of each garden, investigating the magnitude, temporal
   stability, and diversity and composition of garden nectar supplies. We
   found that individual gardens differ markedly in the quantity of nectar
   sugar they supply (from 2 to 1,662 g), and nectar production is higher
   in more affluent neighbourhoods, but not in larger gardens. Nectar
   supply peaks in July (mid-summer), when more plant taxa are in flower,
   but temporal patterns vary among individual gardens. At larger spatial
   scales, temporal variability averages out through the portfolio effect,
   meaning insect pollinators foraging across many gardens in urban
   landscapes have access to a relatively stable and continuous supply of
   nectar through the year. Turnover in species composition among gardens
   leads to an extremely high overall plant richness, with 636 taxa
   recorded flowering. The nectar supply is dominated by non-natives, which
   provide 91\% of all nectar sugar, while shrubs are the main plant life
   form contributing to nectar production (58\%). Two-thirds of nectar
   sugar is only available to relatively specialised pollinators, leaving
   just one-third that is accessible to all. Synthesis and applications. By
   measuring nectar supply in residential gardens, our study demonstrates
   that pollinator-friendly management, affecting garden quality, is more
   important than the size of a garden, giving every gardener an
   opportunity to contribute to pollinator conservation in urban areas. For
   gardeners interested in increasing the value of their land to foraging
   pollinators, we recommend planting nectar-rich shrubs with complementary
   flowering periods and prioritising flowers with an open structure in
   late summer and autumn.},

Title = {Variation in Vegetation Structure and Composition across Urban Green
   Space Types},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {HIGHLIGHTS
   Vegetation structure and composition were measured in four major green
   space types
   Remnants and golf courses supported highest native plant richness
   Residential neighborhoods and urban parks supported highest exotic plant
   richness
   Residential neighborhoods lacked key habitat structures including old
   trees
   Green spaces can achieve complex vegetation with both native and exotic
   vegetation
   The ecological sustainability and function of urban landscapes is
   strongly influenced by the composition and structure of the local plant
   community. Taxonomic composition generally refers to the identity of the
   species comprising the community, while we define structure as the
   presence of multiple canopy layers, as well as stems of varying diameter
   and age. These aspects of urban vegetation significantly influence the
   ecology of cities, yet they are generally poorly quantified across the
   range of natural and constructed plant communities present in urban
   landscapes. We quantified vegetation composition and structure to (i)
   simultaneously assess their variation across four green spaces types
   (golf courses, public parks, residential neighborhoods, and patches of
   remnant vegetation) in Melbourne, Australia, and (ii) investigate the
   relationship between vegetation composition and structure within these
   green spaces. The four green space types supported distinctly different
   plant communities. Vegetation composition in the residential
   neighborhoods differed significantly from the others (p < 0.05), largely
   due to the increased richness of shrubs and cultivated plants, and the
   reduced presence of large trees. Residential neighborhoods had the
   highest plant species richness, although a large proportion of these
   species occurred infrequently. The structural complexity of understorey
   vegetation (calculated as \% volume occupied) below 0.5 m was highest in
   remnant patches followed by golf courses, public parks, and residential
   neighborhoods. The structural complexity of understorey vegetation in
   remnant vegetation patches was very similar to that of golf courses even
   though some of the latter were dominated by exotic plant species.
   Variation in the composition and structure of urban vegetation might
   have great implications for the retention of faunal diversity within
   cities because different taxa have specific habitat requirements. Hence,
   further understanding of variations in the composition and structure of
   both natural and constructed plant communities in cities will greatly
   improve our ability to create urban landscapes that enhance both plant
   and animal biodiversity.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Attitudes toward urban residential trees and awareness of their
   ecosystem services and disservices may play an important role in
   management decisions of private residential green spaces with important
   consequences to urban sustainability. In 2011, 397 household surveys
   were conducted in six locations of the Rio Piedras Watershed (San Juan,
   Puerto Rico) to evaluate residents' attitudes toward residential and
   neighborhood trees and their association with household
   socio-demographic factors, how awareness of services and disservices
   relate to the spatial proximity of trees (home versus neighborhood), and
   whether attitudes are associated with yard management (tree abundance).
   Most residents self-reported positive attitudes toward trees in general
   and these appeared to be more frequent than self-reported negative
   attitudes. Respondents recognized more tree services (emphasizing shade,
   lower temperature, food, and ornamental/aesthetics) and fewer
   disservices (emphasizing maintenance hardship, property damage, and
   power line obstruction). Not all tree services and disservices were
   equally recognized, and differences in the spatial context of trees and
   residents may contribute to the variation in residents' awareness of
   tree ecosystem services or disservices. Variation in positive attitudes
   partially explained the current variation in yard tree abundance, along
   with residents' age, housing tenure, yard size, and watershed location.
   Results have direct implications for urban forest planning and
   management in residential contexts.},

Title = {Performing weeds: Gardening, plant agencies and urban plant conservation},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {124-136},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Private domestic gardens have been the site of diverse inquiry in both
   the social and natural sciences. Intersected by these inquiries this
   paper focuses on how `weeds' are (re)constituted through gardening
   practices in domestic gardens in Christchurch, New Zealand. The paper
   arises out of an interdisciplinary ecological and social scientific
   study of the factors influencing the distribution and regeneration of 12
   bird-dispersed native woody species from Riccarton Bush, an urban forest
   remnant of significant ecological rarity, into surrounding residential
   properties. As part of this study we were especially interested in how
   people's everyday experiences and encounters in their gardens guide
   their gardening practices and what possibilities, if any, these create
   for self-introduced native seedlings to establish, and mature into
   adults. Drawing inspiration from literatures on human-plant relations we
   use the concepts of performance, non-human and `planty' agencies to
   argue that weeds are performed by people and plants rather than having a
   pre-determined or pre-figured meaning. Empirically the paper seeks to
   highlight the diverse, unique and disruptive agencies of plants.
   Methodologically it reflects on ways of engaging with and researching
   human-plant relations. In concluding, the paper examines how concepts of
   performance, non-human and planty agencies can provide insights for weed
   management and urban plant conservation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {ZOOKEYS},
Year = {2014},
Number = {452},
Pages = {79-105},
Abstract = {A Skinner mercury vapor light trap was operated from 2001 through 2009
   in a residential backyard to document biodiversity within the moth
   families Thyatiridae, Drepanidae, Geometridae, Mimallonidae,
   Apatelodidae, Lasiocampidae, Saturniidae, Sphingidae, Erebidae
   (including Lymantriinae and Arctiinae), Euteliidae, Nolidae, and
   Noctuidae. When making comparisons to older literature, we recalculated
   our results to conform to the older classification of the Noctuoidea.
   Moths were released after identification. There were 501 species
   documented in 77581 captures from 1290 sampling dates. There was a
   perceived risk that released moths would fly back into the trap the
   following evening. This should result in an abnormal number of rare
   moths that are caught multiple times. The number of species caught twice
   versus the number caught once was no different than a similar ratio for
   surveys that used more traditional sampling methods. Therefore this
   concern does not seem to be valid for these data. These data are
   provided in a supplementary file available for download.
   There were three previous surveys conducted in nearby natural areas.
   They documented fewer species than were documented here. To understand
   this better, we examined several specialized groups of moths that tend
   to use host plants not typically found in an urban residential yard.
   More species in Schinia Hubner, Catocala Schrank, Acronicta
   Ochsenheimer, and Herminiinae Leech were found in this survey than the
   other local surveys. Only in the Papaipema Smith did we recover fewer
   species, though it was still above 70\% of what was expected. This
   diversity could be a result of sampling effort, but it shows that this
   urban location has a very diverse moth fauna. We suggest that this
   diversity is partly due to the planting of native plant species in the
   area about the light trap. Therefore we would concur with others that
   urban landscapes can be planned to increase biodiversity relevant to
   more natural ecosystems.
   In this study we looked at the ratio of the number of species of
   Geometridae divided by the number of species of Noctuidae as one
   approach to evaluating the level of disturbance in the moth assemblage.
   Although the yearly average was nearly constant, the seasonal ratio
   ranged from 0.09 to 0.91 depending on the sampling date. We also
   calculated alpha diversity and found that seasonal change in alpha
   diversity greatly exceeded yearly differences. This strong seasonal
   component means that a comparison between two studies requires a
   correction for seasonality and similar sampling intervals. In this
   study, a shift of two weeks would be sufficient to result in a
   significant difference in alpha diversity. This is the equivalent of
   increasing temperature by 1.53 degrees C. Seasonal shifts limit the
   usefulness of this methodology for environmental assessment because the
   within season change exceeds the between season change. This problem is
   compounded when sampling designs interact with this seasonality.
   In describing our data, we made use of a growing degree day (GDD) model.
   This approach corrects for simple temperature dependent shifts in moth
   biology. Consequently, some of the variability in the data was removed,
   which should improve the power of statistical tests involving survey
   data. If sampling protocols were based on growing degree days rather
   than calendar dates, the bias caused by temperature induced shifts in
   seasonal cycles could be reduced.},

Abstract = {With increasing urbanization and environmental degradation, urban
   landscapes are increasingly expected to provide a wide range of
   ecosystem services typically associated with rural areas, including
   biodiversity conservation and food production. Because residential
   landscapes constitute the largest single urban land use, domestic
   gardens have emerged as a topic of research interest and planning
   concern. The ecosystem services (or disservices) these landscapes
   provide, however, have not been rigorously measured, nor have tradeoffs
   between the services they provide been assessed. In this study,
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with 59 African American,
   Chinese-origin or Mexican-origin households with on-lot or vacant lot
   food gardens in Chicago. Crop plants and cultivated ornamental plants on
   the lot were inventoried and mapped at the species level. A total of 123
   edible plant taxa from 25 families and 288 ornamental plant species from
   85 families were identified, for a combined total of 387 species from 90
   families. Cumulatively, the gardens of African American households were
   relatively rich in ornamental plant species and families, while those of
   Chinese-origin households had a depauperate flora. Crop plant richness
   was more even across sample types. Shade trees and a developed shrub
   layer were absent from most gardens, possibly representing a trade off
   in ecosystem services in favor of food production. The richness of the
   aggregate 2.1 ha of residential property inventoried in this study was
   comparable with or exceeded that of a 34 ha prairie remnant west of
   Chicago. However, only 35 (9.6\%) of the inventoried species were native
   to the Chicago area.},

Abstract = {Epidemiologic studies have used both questionnaires and carpet dust
   sampling to assess residential exposure to pesticides. The consistency
   of the information provided by these two approaches has not been
   explored. In a population-based case-control study of non-Hodgkin's
   lymphoma, carpet dust samples were collected from the homes of 513
   control subjects in Detroit, Iowa, Los Angeles, and Seattle. The samples
   were taken from used vacuum cleaner bags and analyzed for 30 pesticides.
   Interviewers queried subjects about the types of pests treated in their
   home using a detailed questionnaire accompanied by visual aids.
   Geographic variations in pesticide levels were generally consistent with
   geographic differences in pest treatment practices. Los Angeles
   residents reported the most treatment for crawling insects, fleas/ticks,
   and termites, and Los Angeles dust samples had the highest levels of
   propoxur, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, permethrin, and chlordane. Iowa had
   the most treatment for lawn/garden weeds, and also the highest levels of
   2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and dicamba. Although Seattle had the
   highest proportion of subjects treating for lawn/garden insects, the
   lawn/garden insecticides were higher in other sites. Multivariate linear
   regression revealed several significant associations between the type of
   pest treated and dust levels of specific pesticides. The strongest
   associations were between termite treatment and chlordane, and flea/tick
   treatment and permethrin. Most of the significant associations were
   consistent with known uses of the pesticides; few expected associations
   were absent. The consistency between the questionnaire data and
   pesticide residues measured in dust lends credibility to both methods
   for assessing residential exposure to pesticides. The combined
   techniques appear promising for epidemiologic studies. Interviewing is
   the only way to assess pesticide exposures before current carpets were
   in place. Dust sampling provides an objective measure of specific
   compounds to which a person may have been exposed through personal use
   of a pesticide or by drift-in or track-in from outside, and avoids
   recall bias.},

Abstract = {Capsule Bird communities are better conserved in vineyards with
   mechanically managed herbaceous cover corridors. Aims To determine the
   advantages of herbaceous cover corridors for the conservation of
   farmland birds. Methods We studied birds in three vineyards subjected to
   different crop management schemes. Two vineyards had a herbaceous cover
   planted between crop rows to prevent soil erosion. In one vineyard these
   herbaceous cover corridors were chemically managed to prevent
   competition between the herb cover and the crop, whereas in a second the
   herbaceous cover was subject to mechanical management through some
   clearing, crop coverage, and height checks. A third vineyard was under
   conventional management (bare soil and soil tillage) and served as a
   control. We compared landscape structure and metrics, and passerine
   species richness, abundance, and diversity between the three vineyards.
   Results Overall bird species richness and diversity, as well as
   abundance of insectivorous passerine birds were highest in the
   mechanically managed vineyard. The chemically managed vineyard had lower
   species richness and abundance in comparison to the mechanically managed
   vineyard. In contrast, the conventionally managed plot had the lowest
   bird diversity, abundance, and species richness of all three plots.
   Landscape diversity was similar across the three vineyards. Conclusion
   Although our findings are preliminary and more research and replications
   are needed, we demonstrate that mechanically managed herbaceous cover
   corridors in vineyards, have positive impacts on the resident bird
   communities.},

Title = {Evaluation of Ecosystem Service Value of Homegarden in Chengdu Plain and
   Relevant Protection Strategy},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Homegarden (HG) in Chengdu Plain is an important agricultural
   heritage in China, and is viewed as a sustainable land use pattern. HGs
   are damaged continuously under the backdrop of urbanization and land use
   changes, thus influencing ecosystem services and residents' welfare.
   This study investigates the distribution characteristics of HGs in
   Chengdu and their ecosystem service value and proposes HG protection
   strategies on this basis. Results demonstrate that (1) there are 71,892
   HGs in Chengdu, covering an area of 558.70 km2. The average density is
   9.94 HGs/km2. (2) The total ecosystem service value of HGs is about USD
   30562.70 million/year. Among them, the material product, regulating
   services, biodiversity maintenance value, and cultural services account
   for 15.46\%, 37.90\%, 14.19\%, and 32.45\%, respectively. (3) The
   number, area, and ecosystem service value of HGs in Chengdu decreased by
   11.45\%, 20.89\%, and 6.92\% in the last ten years, respectively. (4)
   The area of the extremely important protection zone of HGs accounts for
   21.14\%. We suggest giving priority attention to these areas. Protection
   strategies of HGs include, among others, formulating HG protection
   plans, keeping traditional features, maintaining biodiversity, and
   increasing the economic income of residents.},

   abundance of moths and higher species richness than residential yards.
   Residential yards were found to have a high proportion of ``tourist
   species.{''} Urban woodlot moth species were significantly larger than
   residential moth species, leading us to hypothesize that larger moths
   may be more prone to predation in open habitats. The woodlot moth
   assemblage was also characterized by a higher percentage of tree
   generalist species; the residential moth assemblage had a higher
   percentage of grass/herb generalist species.},

Title = {Determinants of willingness to add pollinator beneficial plants to
   residential yards differ by plant type},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {370},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Yards (i.e. residential gardens) can provide suitable food and refuge
   for a variety of pollinators, but residents' decisions to make such
   changes to their yards depend on socio-economic characteristics of
   residents, their lifestyle and life stage, perceived or existing social
   norms surrounding yard appearance and associated care, as well as yard
   characteristics such as yard size and characteristics of the plants
   themselves. In this study, we randomly selected properties in two
   counties in southwestern Ohio along two gradients: parcel size and
   parcel valuation (as proxies for urbanization and income gradients,
   respectively). Two hundred surveys were deployed asking residents about
   their yard management practices, and their willingness to plant three
   pollinator beneficial plants (Asclepias syriaca, Echinacea purpurea, and
   wildflowers (multiple spp.)). One hundred and thirteen surveys were
   returned (57\% response rate). For residents who did not have the
   aforementioned plants in their yards at the time of the survey, i.e.
   nearly two-thirds of the respondents, we used random forest models to
   uncover determinants of willingness to add the native plants shown in
   the survey in residential yards. Overall, this subpopulation is
   unwilling to add the plants shown in the survey, especially if they like
   to keep their backyards neat and tidy. However, differences exist
   regarding the key explanatory variables of the willingness to plant A.
   syriaca compared to the other plant types shown in the survey. For A.
   syriaca property value is not an important explanatory variable but not
   growing hay and enjoying mowing are associated with stronger willingness
   to plant A syriaca. For the other native plant types, lower income
   residents were the least willing to plant them suggesting they might not
   have the capacity to do so and/or are strongly wanting to adhere to
   traditional yard aesthetics. The highest income residents were also less
   willing to add these plants. These findings suggest that approaching
   homeowners to convert land to native plants should take different tacks
   for different native plants. For example, to attempt to convince
   midwestern residents to plant A. syriaca, we suggest focusing on more
   rural households and properties where hay is not grown. Together, our
   results indicate that this coupled human-natural system is strongly
   influenced by a variety of variables that support the ``ecology of
   prestige{''} theory (Grove et al., 2014) and that the potential for
   voluntarily erecting pollinator beneficial plantings on private lands
   where they are currently absent might be rather limited.},

Abstract = {Urban forests are valuable spaces for species conservation, protection
   of local biodiversity and provision of ecosystem services. However, they
   are also vulnerable to the impact of extreme climate events like
   hurricanes. Understanding how urban forests are responding to hurricane
   disturbances is crucial to improve their design, management, and
   resilience. Here we analyzed pre-and post-hurricane vegetation surveys
   in 52 residential yards in San Juan to assess urban forest responses
   after Hurricanes Irma and Maria impacted Puerto Rico in 2017. We used
   these surveys to compare vegetation structure and composition (including
   species-specific mortality and damage rates) and to quantify changes in
   the ecosystem services provided by these yards. We found that hurricane
   disturbances significantly altered the structure but not the composition
   of yard vegetation. We detected a 27\% reduction and 31\% mortality of
   standing stems, and a significant reduction in plants health. Yard
   species composition was dominated by non-native species and this trend
   did not change with hurricane disturbance. Changes in vegetation
   structure translated into substantial reductions in ecosystem services.
   Food provision, an important service provided by a large proportion of
   yards before the hurricane, reported the highest reduction (41.9\%)
   while carbon storage was the service that changed the least (9\%). Our
   combined results emphasize the key role played by residential yards
   providing ecosystem services in tropical cities and call for further
   efforts to manage private and public urban forests in ways that may
   ensure their resilience to mitigate extreme climate events, provide
   multiple ecosystem services, and promote long-term urban sustainability.},

Abstract = {Urban gardens in Central California are highly vulnerable to the effects
   of climate change, experiencing both extended high heat periods as well
   as water restrictions because of severe drought conditions. This puts
   these critical community-based food production systems at risk as
   California is expected to experience increasing weather extremes. In
   agricultural systems, increased vegetation complexity, such as greater
   structure or biodiversity, can increase the resilience of food
   production systems from climate fluctuations. We test this theory in 15
   urban gardens across California's Central Coast. Local-and
   landscape-scale measures of ground, vegetation, and land cover were
   collected in and around each garden, while climate loggers recorded
   temperatures in each garden in 30 min increments. Multivariate analyses,
   using county as a random factor, show that both local-and
   landscape-scale factors were important. All factors were significant
   predictors of mean temperature. Tallest vegetation, tree/shrub species
   richness, grass cover, mulch cover, and landscape level agricultural
   cover were cooling factors; in contrast, garden size, garden age, rock
   cover, herbaceous species richness, and landscape level urban cover were
   warming factors. Results were similar for the maximum temperature
   analysis except that agriculture land cover and herbaceous species
   richness were not significant predictors of maximum temperature.
   Analysis of gardener watering behavior to observed temperatures shows
   that garden microclimate was significantly related to the number of
   minutes watered as well as the number of liters of water used per
   watering event. Thus gardeners seem to respond to garden microclimate in
   their watering behavior even though this behavior is most probably
   motivated by a range of other factors such as water regulations and time
   availability. This research shows that local management of ground cover
   and vegetation can reduce mean and maximum temperatures in gardens, and
   the reduced temperatures may influence watering behavior of gardeners.

Abstract = {Lay Summary center dot Supplemental feeding of avian species has been
   linked to beneficial, negative and neutral outcomes. Understanding the
   drivers behind these differences are important for understanding human
   impacts on avian populations as well as developing future conservation
   management plans. center dot We tracked a population of Mountain
   Chickadees from two elevations in the Sierra Nevada, USA for nine years
   and compared the breeding performance of pairs that used versus those
   that did not use feeders available throughout the winter. center dot The
   provisioning we provided is likely similar to the passive backyard
   feeding observed by many across the world but was conducted in an
   isolated natural coniferous forest environment. center dot Despite the
   robust long-term dataset and intensive reproductive monitoring, we found
   no significant differences in the reproductive performance of chickadees
   that accessed feeders and those that did not. center dot Our results add
   to the evidence that the effects of passive or targeted supplemental
   feeding are context and species dependent.
   Supplemental feeding of wild animal populations is popular across many
   areas of the world and has long been considered beneficial, especially
   to avian taxa. Over 4 billion dollars are spent by hobby bird feeders in
   the United States each year alone. However, there is mixed evidence
   whether wildlife feeding is beneficial, including when it is implemented
   as a conservation management tool, a targeted experimental design, or an
   avocation. Much of the current evidence suggests that providing
   supplemental food is advantageous to the reproductive output and general
   survival of focal taxa. However, many of these studies are limited in
   scope and duration, leaving possible negative impacts unaddressed. This
   is particularly true regarding passive backyard feeding, which describes
   the majority of supplemental feeding, including the immense effort of
   millions of public enthusiasts. Here we show that winter supplemental
   feeding prior to reproduction had no significant impact on a range of
   reproductive parameters in a resident, montane passerine species, the
   Mountain Chickadee (Poecile gambeli). This population resides in an
   intact natural environment with no exposure to supplemental food beyond
   our experimental treatments, and individual birds were tracked across
   six years using radio frequency identification technology. Our results
   add to the growing evidence that supplemental feeding alone, isolated
   from the effects of urban environments, may have little to no impact on
   the population dynamics of some avian taxa.},

Journal = {WATER RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {46},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Adapting to changes in water availability is becoming an increasingly
   important environmental management objective in many regions around the
   world. One way for cities to conserve water is to enhance drought
   -resistant vegetation cover. This revegetation practice can take place
   on many types of land, including road -side verges (also known as nature
   strips or boulevards), which, in Western Australia, are publicly owned
   but managed privately by residents of adjoining properties. As
   preferences for alternative verge groundcovers are not well understood,
   designing solutions that help achieve environmental goals and satisfy
   communities is a challenge. We survey community members in Perth,
   Western Australia, and find that peoples' preferences for verge
   landscape design are largely bimodal, and can be classified under two
   dominant groups of people: those who prefer native vegetation, which
   requires little irrigation, and those who prefer watered grass.
   Neighbourhood norms prevail in their rankings, where individuals whose
   neighbours have planted water -conserving native vegetation gardens on
   their verges are also more likely to prefer ecological landscape
   designs. Increasing the extent of gardens that feature water -conserving
   native plants in high -profile public areas may further increase
   community acceptance of low water -use groundcovers, and may assist in
   driving changes in landscape management practices towards having more
   ecological landscape designs on verges, and beyond.},

Volume = {7},
Number = {11},

Abstract = {Effective assessment of biodiversity in cities requires detailed
   vegetation maps. To date, most remote sensing of urban vegetation has
   focused on thematically coarse land cover products. Detailed habitat
   maps are created by manual interpretation of aerial photographs, but
   this is time consuming and costly at large scale. To address this issue,
   we tested the effectiveness of object-based classifications that use
   automated image segmentation to extract meaningful ground features from
   imagery. We applied these techniques to very high resolution
   multispectral Ikonos images to produce vegetation community maps in
   Dunedin City, New Zealand. An Ikonos image was orthorectified and a
   multi-scale segmentation algorithm used to produce a hierarchical
   network of image objects. The upper level included four coarse strata:
   industrial/commercial (commercial buildings), residential (houses and
   backyard private gardens), vegetation (vegetation patches larger than
   0.8/1ha), and water. We focused on the vegetation stratum that was
   segmented at more detailed level to extract and classify fifteen classes
   of vegetation communities. The first classification yielded a moderate
   overall classification accuracy (64\%, k = 0.52), which led us to
   consider a simplified classification with ten vegetation classes. The
   overall classification accuracy from the simplified classification was
   77\% with a k value close to the excellent range (k = 0.74). These
   results compared favourably with similar studies in other environments.
   We conclude that this approach does not provide maps as detailed as
   those produced by manually interpreting aerial photographs, but it can
   still extract ecologically significant classes. It is an efficient way
   to generate accurate and detailed maps in significantly shorter time.
   The final map accuracy could be improved by integrating segmentation,
   automated and manual classification in the mapping process, especially
   when considering important vegetation classes with limited spectral
   contrast.},

Abstract = {How are preferences for ``native{''} and ``introduced{''} species of

   parks, backyards, and more general views about flora and fauna
   appropriate for the city, the paper considers a range of deeply
   enculturated attachments to familiar landscapes. While residents have
   considerable interest in the possibilities of urban ecological
   restoration, our interviews, ethnographic observation, and textual
   analysis also reveal cultural preferences for introduced species and
   emplaced attachments to historically modified landscapes. These
   preferences and attachments are linked to senses of identity developed
   during formative life experiences. In the relatively young post-settler
   society of Australia, such drivers of environmental desires can sit

Abstract = {As cities increasingly become the dominant settlement form across the
   world, it is critical to gain a deeper insight into their dynamics, in
   order to better direct environmental management towards enhancing urban
   sustainability and environmental quality. People are a key driver
   shaping the ecological makeup of cities, not least through landscaping
   actions and choices. In this study, we explore social factors shaping
   plant selection in Cape Town, South Africa through interviews with
   stakeholders responsible for managing and landscaping across three land
   use types: private residential gardens, public parks and open space, and
   conservation areas. We combine an interdisciplinary, multi-scalar
   framework on residential landscape dynamics and a plant traits lens to
   structure our approach to examining the influence of social factors on
   plant selection across spatial and institutional scales in the city,
   from a bottom-up perspective. Residents name a variety of reasons for
   plant selection at the household scale related to plant traits,
   including aesthetics, utility (e.g., food provision), environmental
   suitability, and personal symbolic meanings. Parks managers select for
   ecological suitability as well as aesthetic concerns, and conservation
   managers select chiefly for ecological integrity. All stakeholders
   describe factors at other scales (e.g., property structure, government
   policies) that influence their plant selection. We indicate that a
   complementary patchwork of private gardens and public open spaces could
   serve as a source of trait diversity and provide a variety of ecosystem
   functions and services in the urban landscape, and suggest that
   management and policy efforts can focus on leveraging synergies towards
   this end. This study contributes to a greater understanding of the
   social-ecological dynamics in a global south city and biodiversity

Abstract = {Agrobiodiversity scholarship broadly examines plant-human interactions
   in agricultural landscapes and often concerns the governance of seed
   resources. This article pivots attention away from agrobiodiversity as a
   set of governable genetic resources to examine how the relational
   aspects of agrobiodiversity come to symbolize a future vision of
   environmental governance. Tolima residents are between two significant
   socio-environmental events: the 2016 Peace Accord ending decades of
   violent conflict and the development of an irrigation megaproject. This
   context creates space in which to imagine future governance relations.
   Drawing insights from political ecology-informed environmental
   governance and feminist care ethics, I show how caring material
   practices around native seeds translate into a vision for governance.
   The symbolic frame of agrobiodiversity promotes an alternative ordering
   of human-environment relations than that of export-oriented production,
   which has recently increased in southern Tolima. Methods included 42
   interviews, 60 household surveys, and participant observation throughout
   12 months. Findings illustrate that the caring material practices of
   agrobiodiversity particularly in seed exchanges, home gardens, and
   kitchens become a symbolic frame for environmental governance in which
   access to land, food, and community cohesion are ensured and protected.
   This research makes two contributions to the literature of
   agrobiodiversity. First, drawing on feminist care ethics, I argue that
   the caring material practices of agrobiodiversity create `care-full'
   human-environment connections, especially important in the post-conflict
   context. Second, findings suggest that agrobiodiversity is not simply a
   set of plant materials to be governed, but also can have a strong
   symbolic function as a frame for environmental governance.},

Abstract = {Bipartite networks of flowering plants and their visitors (potential
   pollinators) are increasingly being used in studies of the structure and
   function of these ecological interactions. Whilst they hold much promise
   in understanding the ecology of plant-pollinator networks and how this
   may be altered by environmental perturbations, like land-use change and
   invasive species, there is no consensus about the scale at which such
   networks should be constructed and analysed. Ecologists, however, have
   emphasised that many processes are scale dependent. Here, we compare
   network- and species-level properties of ecological networks analysed at
   the level of a site, pooling across sites within a given habitat for
   each month of surveys, and pooling across all sites and months to create
   a single network per habitat type. We additionally considered how these
   three scales of resolution influenced conclusions regarding differences
   between networks according to two contrasting habitat types (urban
   bushland remnants and residential gardens) and the influence of honey
   bee abundance on network properties. We found that most network
   properties varied markedly depending on the scale of analysis, as did
   the significance, or lack thereof, of habitat type and honey bee
   abundance on network properties. We caution against pooling across sites
   and months as this can create unrealistic links, invalidating
   conclusions on network structure. In conclusion, consideration of scale
   of analysis is also important when conducting and interpreting
   plant-pollinator networks.},

   direct observations and GPS-mapping. There were sightings within the
   three major districts of Ilheus, with 37\% of positive questionnaires (n
   = 359) for marmoset sighting at least weekly. Therefore, marmosets were
   considered common in this city. Most records and frequent sightings were
   associated with secondary forest fragments, backyards with fruit trees
   and mangroves. Marmosets travel among urban fragments using electrical
   and phone wires and crossing roads. There is a relatively small number
   of accidents when compared to the number of sightings, with
   electrocution as the most common. Visitation of marmosets to households,
   attracted by food provisioning, was considered frequent. People feel
   pity for the marmosets and lure them to their houses through food, but
   offered items are not always suitable. Marmoset exploration of uncommon
   habitats, such as mangroves, might be driven by a lack of larger forest
   fragments within the city.},

Abstract = {Smooth-coated otters (Lutrogale perspicillata) were transient in
   Singapore before one resident family group was observed in 1998,
   presumably having recolonized from Peninsular Malaysia. A population
   survey in 2017 revealed a minimum of 11 groups and 79 individuals. Since
   then, movements of otter groups within urban areas have led to
   increasing numbers of human-otter encounters, including conflicts. We
   determined the current abundance, population structure, and distribution
   of smooth-coated otters in Singapore. We assessed seven sampling zones
   nationwide through verified sighting records and social media. Mortality
   records from 2019 to 2021 were sourced from the Otter Working Group and
   Wildlife Reserves Singapore. In early 2021, there were a minimum of 17
   groups and 170 individuals. Groups ranged from 2 to 24 individuals.
   Smooth-coated otters occupy coastal areas, waterways, reservoirs, and
   sites within the city center in urban gardens and ponds. Following
   territorial conflicts at waterways, smooth-coated otter groups moved
   into the urban matrix. Vehicle collisions are the main cause of
   mortality and are frequent at dams separating freshwater and coastal
   habitats. While there is a clear increase in smooth-coated otter numbers
   since 2017, there remain multiple natural and human-caused threats to
   otter persistence.},

Title = {Does Historical Coexistence with Dingoes Explain Current Avoidance of
   Domestic Dogs? Island Bandicoots Are Naive to Dogs, unlike Their
   Mainland Counterparts},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {Introduced predators have a global reputation for causing declines and
   extinctions of native species. Native prey naivete towards novel
   predators is thought to be a key reason for predator impacts. However,
   naivete is not necessarily forever: where coexistence establishes, it is
   likely that naivete will be reduced through adaptation, and the once
   alien predator will eventually become recognised by prey. For example,
   native marsupial bandicoots in Sydney avoid backyards with domestic dogs
   (C. lupus familiaris), but not domestic cats (Felis catus), even though
   cats and dogs were both introduced about 200 years ago (Carthey and
   Banks 2012). The authors attributed bandicoots' recognition of dogs to
   long-term exposure to a close relative of dogs, dingoes that arrived in
   Australia 4000 years ago. Here, we test a prediction of this hypothesis
   by taking the study to Tasmania, where dingoes have never been present
   but where domestic dogs also arrived about 200 years ago. We use a
   similar survey design to that of Carthey and Banks (2012): asking Hobart
   residents to report on pet-ownership, bandicoot sightings and scats
   within their backyards, as well as an array of yard characteristic
   control variables. We predicted that if long term experience with
   dingoes enabled mainland bandicoots to recognise domestic dogs, then
   Tasmanian bandicoots, which are inexperienced with dingoes, would not
   recognise domestic dogs. Our results indicate that Tasmanian bandicoots
   are naive to both dogs and cats after only 200 years of coexistence,
   supporting our hypothesis and the notion that naivete in native prey
   towards alien predators (as observed on the mainland) may eventually be
   overcome.},

Title = {A taxonomically detailed and large-scale view of the factors affecting
   the distribution and abundance of tree species planted in private
   gardens of Christchurch city, New Zealand},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {A city's planted trees, the great majority of which are in private
   gardens, play a fundamental role in shaping a city's wild ecology,
   ecosystem functioning, and ecosystem services. However, studying tree
   diversity across a city's many thousands of separate private gardens is
   logistically challenging. After the disastrous 2010-2011 earthquakes in
   Christchurch, New Zealand, over 7,000 homes were abandoned and a
   botanical survey of these gardens was contracted by the Government's
   Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) prior to buildings being
   demolished. This unprecedented access to private gardens across the
   443.9 hectares `Residential Red Zone' area of eastern Christchurch is a
   unique opportunity to explore the composition of trees in private
   gardens across a large area of a New Zealand city. We analysed these
   survey data to describe the effects of housing age, socio-economics,
   human population density, and general soil quality, on tree abundance,
   species richness, and the proportion of indigenous and exotic species.
   We found that while most of the tree species were exotic, about half of
   the individual trees were local native species. There is an increasing
   realisation of the native tree species values among Christchurch
   citizens and gardens in more recent areas of housing had a higher
   proportion of smaller/younger native trees. However, the same sites had
   proportionately more exotic trees, by species and individuals, amongst
   their larger planted trees than older areas of housing. The majority of
   the species, and individuals, of the larger (>= 10 cm DBH) trees planted
   in gardens still tend to be exotic species. In newer suburbs, gardens in
   wealthy areas had more native trees than gardens from poorer areas,
   while in older suburbs, poorer areas had more native big trees than
   wealthy areas. In combination, these describe, in detail unparalleled
   for at least in New Zealand, how the tree infrastructure of the city
   varies in space and time. This lays the groundwork for better
   understanding of how wildlife distribution and abundance, wild plant
   regeneration, and ecosystem services, are affected by the city's trees.},

Abstract = {Urban domestic gardens (UDG) provide an interesting landscape ecology
   theme with conservation and biodiversity applications.
   Effects of habitat traits on tree species composition, spatial
   distribution and growth performance were studied in private UDG in Hong
   Kong.
   Five groups of tree-habitat variables were assessed: species-count per
   garden, tree-count per garden, lot-frontage width, garden depth, and
   tree-position in garden. Tree structural damage and growth condition
   were evaluated by visual tree-assessment techniques.
   The results recorded 1501 trees representing 72 species distributed in
   261 gardens, with heavy bias towards exotic species (81.9 \%) and exotic
   trees (91.1 \%). The top-five species contributed 45 \% of relative
   abundance, with higher spatial-occurrence and aggregation indices.
   Cluster analysis classified habitats into three groups based on species
   similarity. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified three distinct
   habitats types: good (cluster A), moderate (cluster B), poor (cluster
   C). Species distribution in CA ordination space was demarcated by
   structural damage and overall health condition. Nine species fell under
   the moderate-severe structural damage group, with four in cluster C and
   another four in clusters A and B. Some 41 species had poor and very poor
   overall condition, with seven species in cluster A and 14 in cluster C.
   Species groups were evaluated to inform a species selection strategy.
   Species adoption by homeowners is molded by habitat traits and joint
   operation of collective-extrinsic and individualistic-intrinsic
   influences which have prevented arboreal homogenization and generated
   spatial differentiation. Measures should address the serious
   biodiversity gap induced by landscape fashion, nursery-industry supply,
   and inappropriate species choice.},

Abstract = {Small urban greenspaces, such as neighborhood parks and private gardens,
   have often been overlooked or considered unlikely habitat sources owing
   to their small size, even though they may still provide important
   nesting and food resources for common songbirds. The objective of this
   study was to determine the role of small greenspaces, comprising a
   variety of land-use types, by assessing the distribution and abundance
   of four common songbird species. Point count data collected by the
   Baltimore Ecosystem Study were analyzed for four common urban songbirds:
   American robin (Turdus migratorius), northern cardinal (Cardinalis
   cardinalis), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), and European starling
   (Sturnus vulgaris). Vacant land, small parks, and residential land cover
   within a 200 m radius for each point count location were calculated as a
   proxy for private lawns and gardens,. Abundance modeling was conducted
   to determine which land-cover types best predicted the abundance values
   of each species and the distribution of each species across the city was
   mapped. American robin abundance was positively associated with small
   parks and negatively associated with vacant land, indicating that some
   form of greenspace management might be necessary for American robin use,
   specifically for foraging in short grass or nesting in younger trees.
   European starlings were negatively associated with small parks and had
   the greatest occurrence probability within the densely developed areas
   of downtown Baltimore. Results from this study can inform landscape
   planners of the benefits of certain spatial configurations and land uses
   that could increase urban biodiversity and sustainability. (C) 2015

Abstract = {The fragmentation of landscapes, induced by the growing urbanisation, is
   a major cause of biodiversity loss. Ecological corridors are landscape
   elements that make up for the negative effects of habitat fragmentation
   in agricultural or natural landscapes. However, their effectiveness have
   been rarely assess in an urban context. To do so, we analysed shrews in
   woodlots, corridors and domestic gardens that are connected or
   disconnected from a corridor. Indeed, these mammals are very sensitive
   to fragmentation and could play an important ecological role even in
   small and isolated areas such as domestic gardens. Ninety-seven shrews,
   from three species were trapped. In our study, Sorex coronatus, Sorex
   minutus and Crocidura russula were not widely distributed and mainly
   occurred in woodlots, corridors and connected gardens. In gardens, shrew
   occurrences were mainly determined by landscape configuration with
   negative effects of the distance to the corridor and the distance to the
   woodlot, stronger for C.russula than Sorex species. At the local scale,
   garden management and vegetation showed a positive effect mainly for
   Sorex species. The quality of gardens seems good enough to permit the
   co-occurrence of several species of shrews and thus competition was not
   identified as a major process for determining the occurrence. We showed
   that, as in other ecosystems, ecological corridors in urban context can
   play an effective role for the distribution of organisms with low
   dispersal capabilities and should be develop in planning strategies.},

Abstract = {We studied the richness and composition of diurnal birds in relation to

   identified three species groups: those characteristic of areas with the
   highest proportion of buildings, those associated with a mixture of
   buildings and gardens, and those typical from the green spaces embedded
   in the urban matrix. Although species richness was lowest in the
   downtown area, where building density was highest, in the suburbs there
   was no relation between building density and species richness and
   overall species richness did not differ from the values observed in the
   woodlands and croplands imbedded in the urban matrix. Overall spatial
   species distribution was narrower in spring and broader in winter,
   suggesting that many bird species have a broader use of the urban
   landscape in winter. We observed the highest species turnover between
   spring and winter in the croplands and woodlands found within the urban
   matrix. In winter, the amount of bird life increased in the suburbs and
   decreased in croplands and woodlands, which suggests that residential
   areas provide winter habitats for more species. Our results suggest that
   a complex urban landscape can host a diverse bird community, including
   species of conservation value. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {The residential yard is an integral part of the urban ecosystem.
   Individual preferences and social expectations influence homeowners'
   yard care choices, which in turn affect urban ecology. However, little
   is known about residents' conceptions of their yards as part of the
   urban ecosystem. We asked how homeowners conceive of their yard as part
   of the urban ecosystem by examining urban ecosystem concepts embedded
   within homeowners' descriptions and stories of their yards. Our study
   sites included an urban and suburban area in the Saint Paul-Minneapolis
   metropolitan area of Minnesota, USA. We found that people's
   understandings of their yards as urban ecosystems are complex but have
   prominent gaps. Salient concepts included biotic and abiotic
   interactions within the yard, linkages of human inputs and weeds across
   yards and watersheds, and yards as social space. Stories described
   managing dynamic ecological processes within yards to maintain a steady
   state and limiting linkages of human inputs beyond the yard. Prominent
   gaps included ecological cycles, biodiversity, and ecosystem services
   within yards and ecological linkages across yards. In general, people
   conceived of their yards in terms of inputs rather than cycles and in
   terms of creating barriers between their yards and surrounding areas
   rather than fostering ecological interconnections across them. We
   provide recommendations for resident outreach programs based on our
   findings. Finally, our study presents a challenge to urban ecosystem
   research to unravel where there are gaps in understandings of urban
   ecosystems versus where there is resistance to incorporating certain
   ecological interactions within the residential yard.},

Abstract = {. Maintaining and caring for residential landscapes is a crucial aspect
   of residential lawns represent a significant economic investment, signal
   their social commitments, and reflect their personal characters. To
   investigate the differences in Florida homeowners' priorities regarding
   residential landscape features, an online survey of 1220 homeowners was
   conducted. Four different groups of homeowners were identified based on
   their perceived importance of the four landscape features, namely,
   environmental, financial, aesthetic, and psychological benefits. Factors
   such as environmental and financial attitudes and social norms
   influencing homeowners' decision-making were examined. The findings
   revealed that homeowners' knowledge of landscaping practices and
   environmental attitudes impact their prioritization regarding landscape
   features.},

Title = {Climate gradients, and patterns of biodiversity and biotic
   homogenization in urban residential yards},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Residential yards constitute a substantive biodiverse greenspace within
   urban areas. This biodiversity results from a combination of native and
   non-native species and can contribute to biotic homogenization.
   Geographical climatic patterns affect the distribution of native species
   and may differently affect non-native species. In this study, we
   examined biodiversity and biotic homogenization patterns of
   yard-dwelling land snails across 12 towns in Oklahoma and Kansas (USA).
   The 3 x 4 array of towns incorporated a N-S winter temperature gradient
   (mean low January temperature range = -8.4 to 0.1 degrees C) and an E-W
   annual rainfall gradient (annual rainfall range = 113.8 to 61.3 cm/yr).
   Ten yards per town were surveyed. We hypothesized that mild winter
   temperatures and greater annual rainfall would be associated with
   greater snail abundance and richness, and that the presence of
   non-native species would contribute to biotic homogenization. Non-native
   snails were present and often abundant in all towns. Snail communities
   varied with both rainfall and cold temperature. Contrary to our
   prediction, snail abundance was inversely related to annual
   rainfall-likely because drier conditions resulted in greater yard
   watering that both augmented rainfall and maintained moist conditions.
   Sorensen similarity between towns for the entire land snail community
   and for only non-native species both showed distance-decay patterns,
   with snail composition becoming less similar with increasing
   distance-patterns resulting from species turnover. The biotic
   homogenization index also showed a distance-related pattern, such that
   closer towns were more likely to have biotic homogenization whereas more
   distant towns tended to have biotic differentiation. These results
   support the concept that biotic homogenization is more likely regionally
   and that climatic changes over distance result in species turnover and
   can reduce spatially broad biotic homogenization.},

Abstract = {Invasive species control or eradication is an important issue. On the
   islands of Hawaii, this problem is exceedingly evident when it comes to
   Miconia calvescens (Miconia). Adequate funding is needed to control or
   eradicate this invasive plant, but with the limited amount of funding
   available for the fight against Miconia, it is important to make sure
   that the fund is being spent in a way that addresses the needs or
   preferences of the Hawaiian residents. Using the conjoint choice
   experiment method, we designed a survey that would measure the Hawaiian
   residents' willingness to support Miconia control program attributes.
   The attributes focused on were cost, biodiversity loss, extent of spread
   and soil erosion. Latent class approach was used to assess the surveyed
   population to see the different preferences by individual classes. The
   results show three different classes or groups of individuals with
   varying preferences for a control program of which cost and erosion were
   the top preferred attributes among the classes. These groups were
   defined by their socio-demographics of income, the length of residency
   and exposure to farming/gardening activities. Even with a preference for
   lower cost, a group showed willingness to pay more (\$2.40) for a
   program that reduces erosion from high to low. Finally, the biodiversity
   attribute had very low consideration from a majority of the respondents
   showing the need for educating the public regarding its importance in
   preserving the unique environment in Hawaii.},

Title = {Associations between self-reported pest treatments and pesticide
   concentrations in carpet dust},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Background: Recent meta-analyses demonstrate an association between
   self-reported residential pesticide use and childhood leukemia risk.
   Self-reports may suffer from recall bias and provide information only on
   broad pesticide categories. We compared parental self-reported home and
   garden pest treatments to pesticides measured in carpet dust.
   Methods: Parents of 277 children with leukemia and 306 controls in
   Northern and Central California (2001-2007) were asked about insect and
   weed treatments during the previous year. Carpet dust samples were
   analyzed for 47 pesticides. We present results for the 7 insecticides
   (carbaryl, propoxur, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin,
   permethrin), 5 herbicides (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid {[}2,4-D],
   chlorthal, dicamba, mecoprop, simazine), and 1 synergist (piperonyl
   butoxide) that were present in home and garden products during the study
   period and were detected in >= 25\% of carpet dust samples. We
   constructed linear regression models for the relative change in
   pesticide concentrations associated with self-reported treatment of pest
   types in cases and controls separately and combined, adjusting for
   demographics, housing characteristics, and nearby agricultural pesticide
   applications.
   Results: Several self-reported treatments were associated with pesticide
   concentrations in dust. For example, households with flea/tick
   treatments had 2.3 (95\% Confidence Interval {[}CI]: 1.4, 3.7) times
   higher permethrin concentrations than households not reporting this
   treatment. Households reporting treatment for ants/cockroaches had 2.5
   (95\% CI: 1.5, 4.2) times higher cypermethrin levels than households not
   reporting this treatment. Weed treatment by a household member was
   associated with 1.9 (1.4, 2.6), 2.2 (1.6, 3.1), and 2.8 (2.1, 3.7) times
   higher dust concentrations of dicamba, mecoprop, and 2,4-D,
   respectively. Weed treatments by professional applicators were
   null/inversely associated with herbicide concentrations in dust.
   Associations were generally similar between cases and controls and were
   consistent with pesticide active ingredients in these products during
   the study time period.
   Conclusions: Consistency between self-reported pest treatments,
   concentrations in dust, and pesticides in products lends credibility to
   the exposure assessment methods and suggests that differential recall by
   case-control status is minimal.},

Abstract = {Urban nature, including residential gardens, can promote biodiversity
   and increase human wellbeing. Understanding factors that encourage the
   spread of gardening within cities may help planners facilitate healthier
   and more biodiverse urban communities. This study characterizes the
   spatial distribution and attributes of gardens found in easement areas
   of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Spatial analyses of these privately managed
   public spaces provide evidence of clustering for both presence of
   gardens and their esthetic quality. Data collected on the location and
   attributes of easements from 22,562 properties during summer of 2009,
   show that 11\% of these properties held an easement garden. Results of
   multiple spatial analyses, each targeting a different aspect of garden
   distribution, show that (a) the most intense easement garden clustering
   occurs among neighbors with direct visual access to nearest neighbors'
   easement areas; (b) it is 2.4 times as likely that a property holds an
   easement garden if a property within 30 m holds one; (c) although
   clustering is measureable for all neighborhood sizes up to 610 m from
   home, peak clustering happens within 91 m of home; and (d) clustering of
   easement gardens are clustered in terms of quality (appeal), and
   greatest clustering occurs between pairs of adjacent neighbors. While
   larger scale factors may play a role in where a garden cluster is
   initiated, the dominant occurrence of relatively small cluster sizes
   indicates that social contagion is in play. The potential value of
   social contagion is discussed as a mechanism for spread sustainable
   behaviors that support ecological resilience in urban areas. (C) 2012

   suburban areas of the Costa Brava (Spain)},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {941-951},
Abstract = {A substantial proportion of the cultivated plants in urban domestic
   gardens in Europe are exotic species. Among these species, a large
   number may become invasive, causing negative impacts on natural areas.
   To prevent this situation, the early detection of invasive species and
   the assessment of propagule pressure play a key role. In this study, we
   analyse the flora of 258 domestic gardens in the Costa Brava to explore
   the importance of these factors in these urban ecosystems. Of the 635
   taxa identified, 68\% were exotic (77\% considering only cultivated
   plants). Moreover, 39 species were considered invasive in Spain,
   although only 25 were present within the limits of the adjacent
   Aiguamolls de l'Emporda Natural Park (AENP). The results from multiple
   regression models showed that all plant biodiversity parameters (overall
   plant richness and exotic and native plant richness) were strongly
   related to the garden area, the occupancy rate of the house and the
   different socio-economic and cognitive characteristics of the household
   members. A distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) showed that the
   invasive species composition was related to the garden area, the age of
   the building, the income level and the proportion of non-working
   residents. We also detected that garden centres were by far the most
   used source of horticultural species, although garden plants were
   replaced and/or renewed after relatively long periods of time. We
   conclude that influencing homeowners' preferences by providing more
   detailed information in garden centres and nurseries may lead to the
   creation and restructuring of more native and environmentally friendly
   private landscapes. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {There is a lack of information on the environmental effects of urban
   change and the dynamics of greenspace. Such information is essential for
   a better understanding of the sustainability of urban development
   processes, both planned and unplanned. We therefore investigated the
   changes in land use and land cover of 11 residential areas in
   Merseyside, UK, using aerial photographs taken in 1975 and 2000. We then
   modeled how these changes would alter three important environmental
   parameters: surface temperature, runoff of rainfall, and greenspace
   diversity. These changes were then related to the socio-economic status
   of the areas, as measured by an index of multiple deprivation. The
   comparisons revealed a loss of greenspace in all 11 case study sites
   Overall, the more affluent, low density areas lost more greenspace,
   especially of tree cover. A major cause was infill development whereby
   gardens were built over. However, greenspace was also lost in already
   densely built-up, deprived areas due to the reuse of derelict land. As a
   consequence, the models used in this study predicted negative
   environmental impacts for all areas. The results emphasize the need to
   critically review concepts such as urban densification and give more
   weight to the preservation and management of urban greenspaces. (C) 2004

   diversity in urban community gardens},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Urban ecological communities are shaped by an array of environmental and
   physical factors that include climate, biogeography, species
   interactions, dispersal, and ecological filters at the habitat and
   landscape scales. In addition, many social dynamics, decision-making
   processes, and other social characteristics, such as development,
   policy, government actions, as well as socioeconomic status of residents
   - the so-called `luxury' effect - may also play strong roles in shaping
   which species occur within the urban context. This interaction between
   ecological and social drivers may impact species richness and may also
   influence functional traits and functional diversity, with important
   implications for ecosystem services provided within urban spaces. Urban
   agroecosystems provide food and other well-being benefits to urban
   residents, and are valuable green spaces in the city that provide
   refuges for biodiversity. Despite this fact, one of the biggest risks to
   gardens is insecure land tenure. While plant communities within gardens
   may be shaped by gardener demographics, food cultures, and ecological
   processes, little is known about how factors such as luxury and land
   tenure security may impact plant diversity, plant functional traits, and
   functional diversity, as well as species and trait composition. In this
   study, we ask how garden physical features, luxury, and land tenure
   security influence plant species richness, functional diversity, and
   species and trait composition within gardens in the California central
   coast. We surveyed vegetation, assessed plant traits related to growth
   form, plant defense, and floral characteristics, and collected
   information on multiple factors associated with land tenure and luxury.
   We found that land tenure secure gardens had higher plant and crop
   richness. Variables associated with garden luxury boosted ornamental
   plant richness, flower abundance and height, lowered crop richness, and
   strongly impacted plant species composition. Garden plot size negatively
   correlated with plant species and functional richness and relative
   abundance of trees. Weed species richness was not impacted by any social
   or physical feature examined. Thus overall, in community gardens,
   cultivated plants, and their traits, are strongly shaped by the
   socioeconomic factors of land tenure security and luxury as well as the
   spatial distribution and size of garden plots, with important
   implications for both conservation and ecosystem services provided by
   garden habitats within cities.},

Abstract = {African woolly-necked storks (Ciconia microscelis) depend on wetland
   habitats for foraging and nesting in natural environments. Recently,
   they have started colonising urban environments in KwaZulu-Natal, South
   Africa, and are now a common sight in suburban areas in particular.
   There have been some anecdotal reports on supplementary feeding of this
   species by households in some urban areas where they are common.
   However, these reports have never been confirmed and therefore the
   extent of feeding and lack thereof is unknown. Using a questionnaire
   survey, we therefore investigated the extent (if any) to which
   householders in urban and suburban areas of KwaZulu-Natal provide
   supplementary food to African woolly-necked storks. We also determined
   the feeders' provisioning habits, and identified the motivation behind
   and attitudes toward feeding. We found that a significant number of
   householders fed African woolly-necked storks on a daily basis
   throughout the year. The majority of respondents provided meat while
   others provided inappropriate food such as bread. Respondents were most
   often motivated to feed for personal pleasure. Our results showed that
   this species is successfully utilising and exploiting anthropogenic food
   - a novel behaviour. The observations and narratives from respondents
   strongly suggest that the African woolly-necked stork is present
   throughout the year, contrary to the perception that this species is
   migratory during winter. Based on the results obtained in this study,
   supplementary feeding of African woolly-necked stork by householders is
   relatively common, widespread and established in suburban areas of
   KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. However, reported inappropriate feeding may
   create concerns regarding the health status of African woolly-necked
   storks in urban population. Therefore, to prevent further detrimental
   effects and potential human-wildlife conflicts we recommend that
   suitable feeding guidelines be formulated.},

Abstract = {Land use change can adversely affect water quality and freshwater
   ecosystems, yet our ability to predict how systems will respond to
   different land uses, particularly rural-residential development, is
   limited by data availability and our understanding of biophysical
   thresholds. In this study, we use spatially explicit parcel-level data
   to examine the influence of land use (including urban,
   rural-residential, and vineyard) on salmon spawning substrate quality in
   tributaries of the Russian River in California. We develop a land use
   change model to forecast the probability of losses in high-quality
   spawning habitat and recommend priority areas for incentive-based land
   conservation efforts. Ordinal logistic regression results indicate that
   all three land use types were negatively associated with spawning
   substrate quality, with urban development having the largest marginal
   impact. For two reasons, however, forecasted rural-residential and
   vineyard development have much larger influences on decreasing spawning
   substrate quality relative to urban development. First, the land use
   change model estimates 10 times greater land use conversion to both
   rural-residential and vineyard compared to urban. Second, forecasted
   urban development is concentrated in the most developed watersheds,
   which already have poor spawning substrate quality, such that the
   marginal response to future urban development is less significant. To
   meet the goals of protecting salmonid spawning habitat and optimizing
   investments in salmon recovery, we suggest investing in watersheds where
   future rural-residential development and vineyards threaten high-quality
   fish habitat, rather than the most developed watersheds, where land
   values are higher.},

   4. We evaluated the significance of the underlying trends in the cyclic
   reporting rates. Eighteen species showed clear trends, the three with
   the most negative year term parameter estimates being `red-listed' as
   high conservation concern.
   5. Examining correlations with national scale survey data suggested that
   garden reporting rates are related to general population trends in a
   number of species, including several of conservation importance. Other
   species exhibit important differences between national and garden
   trends.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis demonstrates ecologically
   meaningful trends and provides novel insights into seasonal cycles of
   habitat exploitation, using relatively simple and cost-effectively
   collected data. This will lead to greater understanding of the
   relationships between gardens and general bird populations and of the
   times of year at which garden habitats are most important for birds. We
   have demonstrated the practicality and productivity of `citizen science'
   in this context, and provided new information on the status of some
   birds of conservation concern.},

Title = {From the Andes to the Apennines: Rise and Fall of a Free-Ranging
   Population of Feral Llamas},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Domestic mammals may become invasive alien species when introduced
   within natural environments and when they establish reproductive
   populations. One of the most common pathways of species introduction is
   represented by intentional or accidental escapes from confined
   environments, including zoos, farms and enclosures. A feral population
   of llama Lama glama has been present in Central Italy since 2016 after
   escaping from a zoological garden. In 2020, only three individuals were
   confirmed to be still present within a 40-hectare area, following a
   field survey. We carried out questionnaires with the resident human
   population to determine the local perception and the acceptance of two
   possible management actions, i.e., direct killing and surgical
   sterilization. Llamas are quite docile domestic animals, thus local
   perception was, in general, very positive and also linked to the exotic
   origin of the species, making llamas a welcome observation and a
   pleasant surprise. The observed decline of this population may be due to
   predation by wolves and poaching, together with the lack of suitability
   of natural environment, which may have prevented llamas establishing an
   invasive population. In this context, however, individual removal action
   should be conducted before the population shows a demographic rebound.
   Since 2016, a feral population of llama Lama glama has been present in
   Central Italy after escaping from a zoological garden and starting to
   reproduce. We updated demographic status and distribution of this
   population and investigated societal perception towards the llama
   presence and management in the area through a standard questionnaire.
   Field data were collected through direct (transects traveled by car and
   on foot) and indirect (newspapers, social networks and online platforms)
   research. The feral population appears to be declining. In July 2020,
   the population was represented by three individuals (one male and two
   females), identified also through photoidentification, most likely
   located within a 40-hectare area. The majority of citizens are aware of
   the presence of feral llamas and show a positive attitude toward them
   and a negative one toward management actions. The case of feral llamas
   in Italy is an evident example of unsafe management of a species which
   should have kept in a zoo and which, once set free, was able to catalyze
   the attention of the general public. The decline of this population
   limits the need of drastic management actions that, given the
   appreciation expressed by people and press toward these animals, would
   have been at risk of conflict with the public opinion. Removal action
   should be rapidly taken, i.e., before any demographic rebound and before
   the population becomes a stable feature of the local landscape.},

Volume = {112},
Number = {A},
Pages = {140-151},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The present study is one of the few that investigate the temporal
   variability of epifaunal assemblages associated with coral species,
   particularly the octocorals Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica
   in south Portugal. The results suggest time rather than colony size as a
   primary driver of the ecological patterns of these assemblages, which
   were dominated by amphipods, molluscs and polychaetes. Temporal
   variability was linked to changes in environmental parameters, namely
   temperature, chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon. Hence,
   temporal variability must be taken into account for the design of future
   biodiversity assessment studies, as different patterns may be observed
   depending on the sampling time. Associated epifaunal assemblages were
   consistently dominated by resident species (i.e. species present in all
   sampling periods) and a peak of rare species was observed in the
   transition from spring to summer following the increase in seawater
   temperature. Turnover was particularly high in the transition between
   the spring and summer periods. In both hosts, turnover was higher in the
   small sized colonies, which harboured less diverse and less abundant
   assemblages that also differed from those inhabiting larger size
   colonies. The high levels of diversity associated with gorgonian
   colonies highlight the need for the conservation of this priority
   habitat. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Previous investigations found elevated mortality after
   breast cancer in association with biomarkers of persistent
   organochlorine pesticides in non-occupationally exposed women. We
   hypothesized that lifetime residential pesticide use, which includes
   persistent and non-persistent pesticides, would also be associated with
   increased mortality after breast cancer.
   Methods: A population-based cohort of 1505 women with invasive or in
   situ breast cancer was interviewed in 1996-1997, shortly after
   diagnosis, about pre-diagnostic lifetime residential pesticide use.
   Participants were followed for mortality through 2014 (595 deaths from
   any cause and 236 from breast cancer, after 17.6 years of follow-up).
   Pesticides were examined as 15 individual categories; a group of seven
   used for lawn and garden purposes; a group of eight used for
   nuisance-pest purposes; and all combined. Cox regression was used to
   estimate hazard ratios (Hits) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for
   all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality. Modification by estrogen
   receptor (ER) status, body mass index, and long-term residence was
   examined.
   Results: Ever use (HR = 0.77, 95\%CI = 0.63-0.95) and higher lifetime
   applications (4th quartile: HR = 0.62, 95\%CI = 0.474.81, P-trend = 0.3)
   of the lawn and garden group of pesticides were inversely associated
   with allcause mortality, compared to never use. The inverse association
   for lawn and garden pesticide use was limited to ER positive (vs.
   negative) tumors (P-interaction = 0.05). Nuisance-pest pesticides, and
   all groups combined, were not associated with all-cause or breast
   cancer-specific mortality.
   Conclusions: Contrary to our hypothesis, lifetime residential use of
   lawn and garden pesticides, but not all combined or nuisance-pest
   pesticides, was inversely associated with all-cause mortality after
   breast cancer.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {129},
Pages = {55-64},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We investigated whether exurban parcel size might be related to
   homeowners' behaviors that could affect carbon balance in residential
   landscapes. Based on data drawn from in-depth interviews and field
   surveys in 26 southeast Michigan exurban households, we conclude that an
   approximately 1-acre (0.45 ha) size may be a critical threshold for
   certain behaviors, such as leaving a portion of an exurban parcel in
   forest or old field or retaining leaf litter on the property. Tree
   planting is a relevant behavior that may increase when parcels are
   larger than 0.5 acres (0.20 ha). Yard style of adjacent properties also
   appears to be related to homeowners' landscape management behaviors:
   conventional turf-dominated yards prevail adjacent to parcels smaller
   than one-acre. We used our analysis of these data to develop an exurban
   homeowner typology to be employed in agent based models in which
   homeowners' behaviors that may affect carbon balance are linked to
   parcel size. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   regarding urban backyard livestock slaughter},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {57},
Pages = {67-77},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In many U.S. cities, a new generation of urban residents is taking up
   gardening, canning, and keeping small livestock. Within this urban
   homesteading movement, the backyard slaughter of chickens and rabbits
   for household food production has become increasingly popular in some
   cities, including Oakland, California, where the practice has incited
   strong feelings and public debate. Based on a survey of 345 San
   Francisco Bay Area residents, this quantitative and qualitative research
   identifies three perspectives among respondents. Some subjects want
   backyard slaughter prohibited, either to maintain emotional distance
   from slaughter or because they believe it is inappropriate for urban
   space. Others express strong support for backyard slaughter, which they
   see as a humane, healthful alternative to meat from intensive animal
   production systems. A third group of subjects support urban residents'
   right to slaughter animals, placing a high value on individual (human)
   liberties whether or not they personally approve of backyard slaughter.
   Each of these perspectives was further associated with a cluster of
   demographic factors, food shopping and production practices, and
   personal experiences with slaughter. We suggest that different
   underlying orientations toward the food system - that is, valuing
   distance, proximity, or freedom - can be seen in the discourses in which
   subjects discuss slaughter, how their city should regulate the practice,
   and in their own food procurement practices. The paper concludes by
   considering both contributions to related literature and the
   implications of findings for alternative food systems and for the
   municipal regulation of urban agriculture. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Wild bees and hoverflies respond differently to urbanisation, human
   population density and urban form},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {204},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While urbanisation contributes to global biodiversity declines,
   flower-rich urban habitats may provide beneficial pollinator habitats.
   We investigated the potential of urban residential areas to contribute
   to pollinator diversity by analysing wild bee and hoverfly species
   richness and composition of species assemblages of summer-active
   species, sampled in 53 gardens across urban and rural landscapes of
   Malmo, the regional capital of Sweden's southernmost county. Species
   richness differed between urban and rural gardens, and between four
   urban residential types (ranging from low human density and high
   vegetation cover, to high human density and low vegetation cover), and
   taxonomic groups responded differently. Solitary bee species richness
   was higher in urban than rural gardens, driven by a higher richness in
   low-density urban gardens compared to both high-density urban gardens
   and rural gardens. In contrast, bumblebee species richness was higher in
   rural than urban gardens, whereas differences among the urban types were
   less clear. Hoverfly species richness was consistently higher in rural
   gardens than any urban garden type. Species richness of all groups was
   negatively related to human population density at the landscape scale
   (radius 500 m), but unrelated to vegetation cover. This indicates that
   population density affects pollinator habitat quality through associated
   green space management and design. Rural and urban wild bee species
   assemblages consisted of different species (significant species
   turnover), whereas urban hoverfly assemblages were a subset of rural
   ones (significant nestedness). Species nestedness of hoverflies, but not
   bees, increased with human population density. We show that urban areas
   can complement the regional wild bee species pool, mainly caused by
   large variation in tenure and management at small spatial scales, while
   urbanisation drives a systematic loss of hoverfly species. We suggest
   alternatives to improve dense residential areas for pollinators.},

Abstract = {In situ propagation of butterflies was attempted through establishment
   of a butterfly garden in a 0.5 ha degraded moist deciduous forest patch
   at the Kerala Forest Research Institute campus at Peechi, Kerala, India.
   Creation of butterfly habitats through landscaping and introduction of
   suitable host plants to sustain different species of butterflies were
   the major activities undertaken. There was tremendous increase in the
   butterfly population with 4509 sightings of butterflies belonging to 43
   species after 15 months and 10,502 sightings of butterflies belonging to
   56 species after 30 months. These included eight species that are
   endemic to the Western Ghats and ten species having protected status
   under the Indian Wildlife Act. Investigations on the relationship
   between the occurrence of different butterflies and the weather
   conditions revealed that an average temperature ranging between 25 and
   26 degrees C was most favourable for many butterflies followed by 23 and
   25 degrees C as well as 27 and 29 degrees C. Similarly, atmospheric
   humidity ranging between 80 and 100\% was the most preferred range
   followed by 60 and 80\%. With regard to daily rainfall, 50 mm was the
   most favourable followed by 50-100 mm rainfall. Heavy rainfall was found
   to be unfavourable since few butterflies were observed above 100 mm of
   daily rainfall. By regulating humidity and temperature, it was possible
   to manipulate local populations of butterflies, particularly danaid
   butterflies. More or less continuous population was noticed for some
   Danaidae, Lycaenidae, Papilionidae and Pieridae, which also developed
   resident populations in the study area. Strategies were also
   standardized for setting up butterfly gardens.},

Abstract = {In an urban environment, ants can find shelter for the construction of

   have been conducted in forest fragments and residential areas, but there
   are few studies on the occurrence of these insects in urban gardens. For
   this reason, the aim of this study is to know the composition of ant
   communities in urban gardens in the city of Juiz de Fora, southeast
   region of Brazil. Samples were taken from six gardens between November
   2005 and June 2006. We used a consortium of three methodologies: active
   searching, baits and pitfall traps. We collected specimens of 26 genera
   and seven subfamilies. The subfamily Myrmicinae was the most diverse,
   and the genus Wasmannia, was considered the most constant, followed by
   Camponotus and Linepithema. The efficiency index of the methodologies
   demonstrated that active searching was the most efficient (96.15\%)
   methodology. This method is efficient and sufficient for sampling ants
   in urban gardens, since 25 of the 26 genera sampled, presenting seven
   exclusive genera. The green area was not positively correlated with the
   diversity of ant genera in the urban gardens, demonstrating that other
   variables may be involved.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {513-527},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {QuestionsPatterns of functional and phylogenetic homogenization of plant
   diversity at the scale of entire cities are well established. However,
   fewer studies have investigated how shifts in the composition of urban
   species pools may alter spatial variation in community assembly across
   patches within a city. We compared plant diversity both within and
   between vacant lots in a single urban neighborhood and asked: (1) how do
   heterogeneous human legacies of land use within vacant lots structure
   plant community diversity and composition and (2) what is the importance
   of human legacies for structuring community composition, relative to
   spatial and environmental variation?
   LocationUrban residential neighbourhood in Baltimore, MD, US (39 degrees
   17N, 76 degrees 38W).
   MethodsWe surveyed herbaceous plant species identity and abundance in 24
   unmanaged vacant lots. We constructed functional and phylogenetic
   diversity metrics from databases and the literature and compared
   taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity between sections of the
   lot where a residential building was once located (building footprint),
   and the area that was originally the garden or backyard (remnant
   garden). We term these different human legacy' groups. We partitioned
   variation in plant community composition between human legacy groups as
   well as across measured environmental and spatial gradients.
   ResultsWe report significant plant community compositional divergence
   between human legacy groups. Beta-diversity, in particular, was
   significantly higher in remnant garden sections compared to building
   footprint sections for all metrics of biodiversity. Plant community
   compositional variation was primarily explained by differences in human
   legacies. We found no measurable effects of selected metrics of local
   environmental variation (abiotic soil characteristics) or environmental
   context (lot area, proximity to other vacant lots and tree canopy) on
   compositional variation. Geographic distance between sites, however, did
   interact with human legacy variation to structure phylogenetic
   composition.
   ConclusionsOur findings suggest that human land-use legacies have
   complex but measurable effects on both the patterns and the processes by
   which species co-existence is maintained across the urban landscape.
   Within a single habitat type (here, residential vacant lots), variation
   in legacies of land use may have a stronger plant community structuring
   effect than contemporary environmental variation.},

Abstract = {Landscape architects and ecologists alike are embracing the
   opportunities urban areas present for restoring biodiversity. Despite
   sharing this goal, their efforts are rarely coordinated. For landscape
   architects, aesthetics and programming are at the forefront of design

   scientific research to guide their decision-making. However, the lack of
   scientific research aimed at developing best ecological practices for

   difficult at a time when many residents are converting their lawns to

   literature from the fields of design and ecology to synthesize relevant
   information about small-scale urban landscaping projects and to identify
   instances in which practitioners from both fields are already ``speaking
   the same language,{''} only with slightly different vocabulary. To
   further promote transdisciplinary collaborations, we present a new
   glossary tool to highlight these parallel concepts across fields. We
   discuss specific situations in which design priorities can be aligned
   with ecological function and propose that more attention should be
   placed on traditional principles of garden design, including perception,
   complexity and repetition, rhythm and order, proportion and scale, and
   form and structure. Finally, we argue that each new urban lawn
   conversion presents an opportunity to test ecological theory at the
   site-scale, conduct much-needed research on the impacts of design
   principles on habitat potential, and promote a collaborative urban

   led to thousands of acres of vacant land maintained as grassy habitats.
   The communities living within these neighborhoods have conceptualized
   reutilization strategies for this land, including urban agriculture and
   the creation of small parks of native plantings. In this 2-year study,
   we examined the impacts of vacant land conversion on spiders within
   residential vacant lots, community gardens, and planted prairies within
   the peri-urban park system. At the time of the study, planted prairies
   on previously vacant land were not common, so those within the park
   system may serve as a foundation for future plantings. We found that
   maintained vacant lots contained the most numerous spider assemblages,
   which was dominated by disturbance-tolerant habitat generalist species.
   Community gardens contained numerically fewer spiders but a slightly
   richer assemblage than vacant lots. Similarly low numbers were also
   found in planted prairies but the assemblage was the most diverse of the
   greenspaces examined. We also contrasted results at the family versus
   genus level in order to assess the taxonomic sufficiency relevant for
   future studies, and found that genus level was important for elucidating
   the effects of urban land use on these spider assemblages. From this
   research, we conclude that spiders are an important indicator group of
   disturbance when examining urban greenspace management and
   revitalization, and that alteration in greenspace design will influence
   biodiversity and assemblage composition.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Access to food is crucial in the life of birds, and affects
   reproduction, survival and, consequently, population size. We
   investigated how traditional care of dogs affected rural birds and other
   animal populations. Using camera traps, it was found that the food fed
   to dogs was also taken by seven species of birds and at least three
   species of mammals. The most numerous species taking dog food was the
   house sparrow, Passer domesticus, which is declining in Europe. In the
   case of this species, females were more likely than males to use food
   provided for dogs, with a clear preference for food prepared in the
   human kitchen. We conclude that the food provided to domestic pets can
   be an important component of the diet of wild birds and mammals living
   close to humans.
   Access to food is crucial in the life of birds and affects reproduction,
   survival and, consequently, population size. In the case of bird species
   inhabiting villages, poorer food conditions now exist, mainly because of
   changes in the lifestyle of rural residents and a reduction in the
   number of farm animals traditionally housed in backyards. Recent changes
   have also affected dog populations in villages, and the majority of them
   are no longer kept outside as guard dogs, but rather inside houses as
   pets. We investigated how traditional care of dogs impacted rural birds
   and other animal populations. The study was carried out at the end of
   winter and early spring in 29 farmsteads in western Poland. Using camera
   traps, it was found that the food fed to dogs was also taken by seven
   species of birds and at least three species of mammals. The most
   numerous species taking dog food was the house sparrow, Passer
   domesticus, which is declining in Europe. In the case of this species,

Abstract = {Gardens remain the least studied and least understood habitat in urban
   areas. With the recent exception of the URGENT funded urban domestic
   gardens project in the UK, there is a notable lack of research on the
   ecological character and contribution of gardens to the wider urban
   biodiversity. This is despite the fact that gardens usually comprise the
   largest vegetated component of the urban greenspace resource. In part
   this omission has been due to the difficulties inherent in obtaining
   ecological data on gardens and the lack of a methodology for classifying
   and analysing garden data. This paper presents data from a study
   undertaken in the city of Dunedin, New Zealand. The study developed a
   methodology using object-oriented classification techniques and very
   high-resolution multispectral Ikonos imagery to automatically map the
   extent, distribution and density of private gardens in the city. The
   focus was on the vegetated garden area which was calculated as
   comprising 46\% of the residential area or 36\% of the total urban area.
   Rigorous accuracy assessments were undertaken. When using the automated
   classification technique, a total of 90.7\% of the private gardens were
   correctly identified. Discrimination of garden types (e.g. trees or
   grass dominated) was encouraging, but still requires improvement. Our
   results indicate the great potential that the methodology has in
   providing a quick method for obtaining good quality ecological data on
   garden habitats in urban areas. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Peri-Urban Community Attitudes towards Codling Moth Trapping and
   Suppression Using the Sterile Insect Technique in New Zealand},
Journal = {INSECTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {New, more socially-acceptable technologies are being developed to
   suppress horticultural pests, because suppression is technically
   difficult with current technologies, especially in urban areas. One
   technique involves the release of sterile insects to prevent offspring
   in the next generation. This technology involves aerial or ground
   release systems, but this could also create issues for the public. This
   study investigated community perceptions of a recently-introduced
   response to codling moth control in New Zealand-Sterile Insect Technique
   (SIT). Community attitudes to SIT were examined in Hastings, New
   Zealand, in April, 2018. Eighty-six detailed interviews were undertaken
   with a random sample of households. This community was very willing
   (98\% agreement) to host a sex pheromone trap in their gardens, and
   condoned regular visits to monitor traps. Attitudes to SIT were very
   positive (98\% in favor). Once explained, the concept of using unmanned
   aerial vehicles to deliver sterile insects was also acceptable (98\%) to
   the community. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles to release sterile
   insects during a hypothetical incursion response of an exotic fruit fly
   was also supported at 98\% by respondent householders. Investigation of
   community attitudes can be valuable to guide practitioners in
   determining suitable technologies before an area-wide programme is
   launched.},

Abstract = {At the time of reflection on green justice, when the role of public
   green spaces is increasing, it is worth paying attention to vernacular
   greenery, especially in single-family residential areas on city
   outskirts which property owners arrange in front parts of plots. The
   paper's aim is to show that vernacular front gardens (VFG) can act as
   missing public space and at the same time have the attributes of public
   green space, providing ecosystem services (ES). In order to confirm
   these assumptions, we carried out a VFG's attributes inventory and a
   survey on garden designers. We identified dominating garden features and
   conducted a cluster analysis of the gardens based on their
   characteristics. The basis for building periurban streetscape in
   single-family housing estates is the visual inclusiveness of VFGs. They
   provide all the ES groups, playing representational, natural and
   recreational roles as well as serving as locations of edible plants
   production. Streets in residential sites, thanks to VFG, can be treated
   as real green public spaces creating a type of green area accessible not
   only to owners but also to pedestrian eyes. We conclude that our results
   can be valuable for city planning but also for the professional garden
   designers.},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Currently, slightly less than half the world's population lives in dense
   urban areas, principally cities. In Australia, nearly 85\% of people
   live in towns with 1000 or more residents. Although individual species
   of urban flora and fauna have often been well studied, little is known
   of the long-term temporal patterns associated with changes in both the
   abiotic and biotic environments as urban systems expand. Using
   historical and current information, the changes in species richness
   (defined as the native and introduced vertebrates and vascular plants)
   in Adelaide, South Australia, are described from its founding in 1836
   until 2002. Adelaide is an isolated city of over a million inhabitants,
   bordered by a range of hills and the South Australian coastline. With a
   Mediterranean climate, a culture that places high importance on private
   residential gardens, and the presence of extensive public parklands, the
   metropolitan area has a. significant diversity of both native and
   introduced flora and fauna. Using only the presence or absence of a
   species, the changes to plant and vertebrate species richness were
   quantified by analyzing the observed patterns of change at a functional
   group level. Powerful correlative evidence is provided to explain the
   development and establishment of patterns in urban ecology.
   There has been a dramatic change in species composition, with an
   increase in total species numbers of similar to30\%. At least 132 native
   species of plants and animals have become locally extinct, and a minimum
   of 648 introduced species have arrived (mostly plants). The plants
   increased in species richness by 46\%. Fifty percent of the native
   mammal species were lost, and overall, the birds declined by one
   species, representing 21 extinctions and 20 successful introductions.
   Amphibians and reptiles showed no net change. The herbaceous perennial
   and annual plant species richness showed a substantial increase. This
   temporal approach to urban ecology demonstrates new ways to identify
   individual species or groups at risk of extinction and provides some
   long-term management goals for large urban areas.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {81},
Number = {1},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In mid 2003 a diverse floral resource was planted in a small urban
   residential plot at the University of California, Berkeley Oxford Tract
   with the goal of attracting local native California bee species to
   assess emerging patterns of diversity and seasonality. A standard
   procedure was then used in 2004 to sample the bees and monitor their
   host flowers. Pollen and nectar resources were abundant and consistently
   available during spring, summer, and early fall months of that year.
   Thirty-two bee species representing 17 genera, and five families used
   these resources through the 2004 season. Urban bees were categorized
   into three seasonalities: early season, late season, and full season
   represented by seven, eight, and 17 species respectively.
   Results of this study indicate that newly-planted urban gardens, which
   are designed for bees, have the potential to attract diverse seasonal
   bee taxa if diverse floral resources are provided throughout the growing
   season. Implications of these finding are discussed in terms of managing
   and conserving local bees in new and more developed urban gardens.
   Long-term monitoring continues at this site.},

Abstract = {Wild pollinators provide important services in both wild and

   wild bees to exotic floral species and novel habitat in a fragmented,

   bee specimens collected in 13 suburban grassland fragments in Denver,
   Colorado were sampled and compared with a pollen reference collection.
   Averaged across two seasonal sampling rounds, 45\% of the bee-borne
   pollen grains were identified to the species level. Wild bees in this
   system were very receptive to using alien plants for pollen foraging, at
   least 45\% of pollen sampled from bee specimens consisted of non-native
   pollen grains. During peak flowering in early summer, bees obtained at
   least 32\% of their pollen resources from within-fragment sources and at
   least 7.5\% from surrounding suburban residential yards. In midsummer,
   within-fragment sources represented 58\% of pollen sampled while yards
   dropped to 1.5\%. These bees appear to be more accepting of exotic
   floral species than of exotic habitat types (yards). The advantages and
   disadvantages of pollen load analysis for movement studies are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The rapidly growing physical footprint of cities makes understanding
   residential landscaping preferences increasingly important for water
   quality, biodiversity conservation, and addressing climate change. In
   this paper we answer four interrelated questions about residential
   landscaping preferences with a case study in Raleigh, NC: (1) How are
   residents' landscaping preferences influenced by what residents believe
   their neighbors prefer? (2) Do residents accurately assess their
   neighbors' landscaping preferences? (3) How does ethnicity influence
   landscaping preferences? and (4) Do the socio-demographic and
   neighborhood norm based correlates of landscaping preferences persist
   when both are accounted for in multivariate models? Respondents (n =
   179) in this study preferred a 50\% native plant garden design over
   100\% turf grass or the 75\% and 100\% native plant garden designs, and
   inaccurately assumed that their neighbors preferred turf over the native
   plant garden based landscaping designs. These results suggest that
   correcting erroneous assumptions about neighborhood preferences may
   alleviate normative pressure against adopting alternatives to turf grass
   landscaping. Although landscaping choices were best predicted by what
   residents perceived their neighbors preferred, ethnicity, income, and
   home ownership were also related to landscape preferences. African
   American ethnicity and income were positively related to preference for
   turf grass coverage. Environmental justice concerns linked to urban
   vegetation should be considered in light of the finding that African
   Americans appeared to prefer turf grass dominated landscaping. Results
   from this study indicate that middle income neighborhoods with high
   levels of home ownership may prove most receptive to initiatives aimed
   at increasing the use of more sustainable landscaping. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {Exurban residential household behaviors and values: Influence of parcel
   size and neighbors on carbon storage potential},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {37-46},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {To learn how household characteristics might affect carbon storage on
   exurban residential parcels, we conducted a web survey of 126 southeast
   Michigan exurban homeowners. We measured several behaviors that may
   affect carbon storage: the proportion of parcel mown (or left unmown
   with woody vegetation), the number of large trees retained, the number
   of trees planted, how leaf litter was managed, the use of fertilizer,
   and the use of irrigation. We investigated whether these behaviors might
   be related to parcel size, homeowners' concern for having a yard that
   fits neighborhood norms, or household demographic characteristics. We
   found that owners of large (>0.53 ha) parcels were consistently
   different from small and medium parcel owners in their management
   behaviors. Large parcel owners mowed a smaller proportion of their
   parcels. They also were less likely to fertilize and irrigate, had
   planted more trees, and had more large trees on their parcels. In
   addition, they reported being less affected by a desire for their yard
   to fit neighborhood norms. Our results suggest that parcel size and
   neighborhood norms together affect landscape behaviors that affect
   carbon storage. We conclude that for large parcels, size alone may
   promote carbon-storing management behaviors. However, for smaller
   parcels, governance should promote appropriate design at the scale of
   whole blocks or subdivisions in order to drive adoption and acceptance
   across neighborhoods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Conserving water in California landscapes is critical due to a limited
   water supply, recurring droughts, and the energy use and costs of
   transporting water from northern to southern California due to a water
   distribution and population imbalance. Metropolitan Water District of
   Southern California (MWD, Los Angeles, CA) spent more than \$310 million
   between 2014 and 2016 on lawn removal rebates in an effort to conserve
   residential water. In some cases, cities and local water districts
   augmented MWD rebates with their own incentives. We conducted a
   web-based study of 1153 southern Californians who removed all or a
   portion of their lawns over the past 10 years to identify their
   motivation, satisfaction, landscape water use, and related maintenance
   practices. Results indicate that rebates were less important for most
   respondents than the desire to conserve water, improve landscape
   appearance, and reduce costs. There was a high correlation between the
   overall satisfaction with the lawn replacement process and the
   appearance of transformed landscapes, supporting earlier findings
   regarding the importance consumers place on landscape appearance.
   Results of this study are timely for providing guidance to policymakers
   and water districts regarding the cost-effectiveness of lawn removal
   rebates to conserve urban water. This study also highlights a need and
   opportunity for water districts and Cooperative Extension to provide
   irrigation training to residents of stand-alone homes who maintain their
   own landscapes. While 90\% of respondents indicated they singly (78\%)
   or jointly (12\%) determine irrigation schedules rather than rely on a
   gardener or landscaper, only 18\% indicated they base irrigation
   schedules on soil moisture content or soil texture (6\%). There is also
   a need to provide education to water districts that incentivize the use
   of synthetic turf in hot inland and desert areas regarding potential
   high-temperature injury to humans, pets, and wildlife.},

   general plant appreciation and literacy. Activities that foster
   people-plant connections can help to alleviate Plant Awareness
   Disparity, foster plant conservation and produce more native plants. We
   describe how our environmental non-profit organization, the Kootenay
   Native Plant Society, has worked to encourage people-plant connections
   in the West Kootenay region of British Columbia, Canada, over a 10-year
   period. We borrowed from different disciplines, practices and theories
   to inform our work-from organic gardening and ecological restoration to
   sustainable development. Our programmes developed from outreach and
   educational activities to more place-based and interactive initiatives.
   Initial activities, including wildflower walks and school programmes,
   offered plant information but more meaningful plant engagement was
   needed. We provided deeper knowledge through a flagship species approach
   showcasing a native plant, camas Camassia quamash, itxwa, resulting in
   greater appreciation for camas, although this strategy rarely translated
   to broader plant conservation by residents. We developed more
   specialized programmes that trained participants in native plant
   propagation and gardening, where they gained competence and contributed
   to a social group linked by community-based conservation efforts and a
   passion for native plants. We learned our journey to connect more people
   with native species and get plants into gardens was a pathway towards a
   community of practice. Building lasting people-plant connections is not
   straightforward; it is an adaptive integrative process requiring
   delivery of dynamic and complementary activities developed over time
   from cumulative insights and organizational reflection. What we thought
   was simply an unavailability of native plants paired with people's lack
   of native plant appreciation was more complex, requiring a shift in
   social understanding of people's relationships with plants. The
   cultivation of a community of practice is an act of socio-ecological
   restoration, a shared pathway that supports a self-sustaining community
   practicing good stewardship and empowered to grow native plants. Read

Abstract = {Predator fear effects influence reproductive outcomes in many species.
   In non-urban systems, passerines often respond to predator cues by
   reducing parental investment, resulting in smaller and lighter
   nestlings. Since trophic interactions in urban areas are highly altered,
   it is unclear how passerines respond to fear effects in human-altered
   landscapes. Nestlings of passerines in urban areas also tend to be
   smaller and lighter than their rural counterparts and are often exposed
   to high densities of potential predators yet experience lower per capita
   predation-the predation paradox. We suggest fear effects in urban
   habitats could be a significant mechanism influencing nestling condition
   in birds, despite lowered predation rates. We manipulated exposure of
   nesting birds to adult-consuming predator risk in residential yards
   across a gradient of urbanization to determine the relative influence of
   urbanization and fear on nestling condition. We found nestlings had
   reduced mass in nests exposed to predator playbacks as well as in more
   urban areas. Despite lower per capita predation rates in urban areas,
   fear effects from increased predator densities may influence passerine
   fitness through reduced nestling condition. As urban development
   expands, biodiversity conservation hinges on a deeper mechanistic
   understanding of how urbanization affects reproductive outcomes.},

Abstract = {While many studies have documented the decline in the extent of
   children's independent movements, none have explicitly evaluated the
   impact of this change in behaviour on opportunities to connect with
   nature. We estimate and compare the biodiversity values within urban
   children's home ranges, and relate exposure to biodiversity to
   children's perceptions and use of their neighbourhoods. We interviewed
   178 children aged 9-11 years in three New Zealand cities. While children
   often had biodiverse areas present within 500 m of their home, their
   restricted home range size meant many of these natural areas fell
   outside of the range of their daily movements. Children's declining
   independent mobility, strongly influenced by parental restrictions,
   appears to limit their freedom to use diverse and natural habitats
   within their urban neighbourhood, with use instead focused on private
   gardens and formal greenspaces. Development of a connection to nature in
   urban areas must therefore take place primarily in private gardens,
   which are threatened by urban planning approaches that promote dense
   residential developments with public rather than private greenspace.},

Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {23-32},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Drivers at multiple scales influence the management of trees, grass and
   other vegetation in residential yards. While significant attention has
   been paid to the varied drivers of residential lawn care and herbaceous
   vegetation, less attention has been directed at urban tree management on
   residential property, particularly at the finer household-scale. This
   study examines residents' tree planting and removal decisions in
   Mississauga (Ontario, Canada) to better understand the way
   household-scale actions shape urban forests. Analysis of survey
   responses and interviews indicate that residents are activity managing
   their trees. Tree planting and species selection decisions were
   primarily motivated by aesthetic preferences and maintenance concerns.
   Additionally, nearly all of the motivating factors identified by
   residents were related to personal preferences and site-level
   characteristics as oppose to the ecosystem services highlighted by many
   researchers and practitioners. Tree removal was most commonly motivated
   by poor tree health. However, underlying many residents' decisions were
   a lack of knowledge about tree care and species characteristics, which
   contributed to a number of healthy tree removals. Ultimately, residents'
   focus on aesthetics is out of alignment with municipal plans that are
   frequently based on ecosystem service provision, while desire for low
   maintenance trees and lack of tree care knowledge raises concerns about
   the long-term sustainability of the urban forest. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {162},
Pages = {56-67},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The world's fast pace of urbanization has exerted profound pressure on
   urban trees. With over 400 years of urban history, Macau has developed
   an exceptionally high population density and ultra-compact mode, yet it
   permits survival of interesting and diverse heritage trees. These
   outstanding living remnants connote special values in history, ecology
   and botany. In conjunction with commemorative importance, they have been
   designated as Old and Precious Trees (OPT). This study evaluated the OPT
   with reference to: (a) species diversity and evenness; (b) spatial
   distribution; (c) tree dimensions, age and health; and (d) spatial
   differentiation of tree attributes by four districts and eight
   tree-habitats. Heritage trees in Macau were compared with those in Hong
   Kong and Guangzhou. The 793 OPT belong to 63 species. The exotic Ficus
   rumphii is overwhelmingly dominant, followed by F. microcarpa,
   Cinnamomum camphora and Dimocarpus longan. Species composition, age
   distribution and health conditions are associated with tree habitat.
   Roadside has the largest number of OPT but the least species richness.
   Public parks and gardens has the highest diversity and largest tree
   dimensions. The oldest trees are clustered in urban parks and religious
   places. Tree health is poorer at roadsides, and private residential and
   commercial properties. The patterns suggest close relationship between
   tree traits and physical fabric of the city. However, the variety rather
   than duration of geographical contacts is a key determinant of urban
   tree diversity. The findings offer insights for heritage-tree
   conservation and management strategies in compact cities with similar
   urban structure and history. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Rose (Rosa spp.), in addition to its commercial importance as a cut
   flower, forms part of the urban fabric of many cities and contributes to
   many ecological functions. To increase purchases by consumers and choose
   appropriate types of roses for urban planning, there is growing interest
   in understanding differences in residents' rose preferences, the
   distribution and features of roses, as well as the relations between
   them. The present study focuses on well-known ornamental roses,
   specifically on which cultivars should be chosen to promote their
   potential for the retail market and in urban planning. To determine the
   rose preferences of residents in Beijing, we analyzed responses to a
   questionnaire that required the residents to choose their preferred
   colors, types, and functions. To address the distribution and features
   of roses in Beijing, we surveyed 546 sites covering different types of
   urban green spaces in the built-up areas. The survey showed that roses
   served a significant ecological function in urban green space. They
   exhibited high resistance to the influence of environment stress, as
   well as different growth habits in the built-up areas of Beijing. In
   terms of residents' main expectations for roses, the predominant
   expectation was color, and particularly ecological outcome. The
   predominant preference for rose color was red. Our results indicated
   that the rose color, type preferences among residents were consistent
   with the rose color, type predominantly planted in Beijing. The best way
   to integrate such civic-led interventions into urban planning and retail

Title = {Factors affecting hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) attraction to
   rural villages in arable landscapes},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {63},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although residential areas are often unfavourable for wildlife, some
   species can take advantage of the available shelter and anthropogenic
   sources of food such as supplementary feeding. The European hedgehog
   (Erinaceus europaeus) is increasingly associated with gardens and
   villages and less so with arable farmland. Suggested drivers for this
   include the following: hedgehogs' attraction to higher food densities,
   including natural prey and anthropogenic sources, a greater range of day
   nest sites and warmer microclimates in rural villages, coupled with
   decreased risk of predation by badgers (Meles meles). We investigated
   the contribution of these drivers by radio-tracking hedgehogs on four
   arable sites, two with badgers present. Seventy-eight hedgehogs were
   tracked, 32 yielding enough data to calculate home range sizes. At the
   home range and landscape scales, gardens and buildings were the highest
   ranked habitats compared with their availability. Woodland and arable
   land were the lowest ranked compared with their availability. Villages
   were the most selected habitat for nesting. When hedgehogs were found
   closer to buildings, their ranges were smaller and we speculate this is
   due to increased food availability in villages. Where badgers were
   present hedgehogs remained closer to cover and their home ranges were on
   average 12.2 ha smaller. On badger-occupied sites, 50\% fewer
   radio-tracking fixes were on arable land. We conclude that resource
   availability coupled with nest site selection and badger presence drives
   hedgehogs' selection of rural villages. We found no effect of ambient
   temperature on habitat use. We recommend focusing conservation efforts
   on maintaining hedgehog populations in rural villages.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {104},
Number = {2},
Pages = {253-259},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Very little little is known about how lizards respond to urbanization.
   Given their small space requirements, opportunist lizard species can
   potentially exist in small patches of suitable urban habitat. This study
   identified the relative importance of landscape and habitat-level
   factors that influenced the occurrence of an opportunist and generally
   abundant species, the common skink Oligosoma nigriplantare polychrome in
   suburban private gardens in New Zealand. Private gardens are potentially
   important in sustaining urban wildlife as they make up a significant
   proportion of the total area of many cities. Common skinks were largely
   absent from the central suburbs and distributed in less highly ordered
   gardens around the city edge. Skink occurrence was influenced mainly by
   landscape-level features that reflect opportunities for dispersal into
   gardens from source populations (distance to city edge; presence of an
   adjacent grassy paddock) and habitat quality (messiness). To a lesser
   extent skink occurrence was associated with lower cat densities, less
   native vegetation and south-facing sites. Within private gardens common
   skinks were associated with areas with a high proportion of basking
   surfaces, lower plant species diversity, shorter distances to potential
   cover, and vegetation that was low in height and made up mainly of long
   exotic grasses. Despite common skinks' ability to thrive in exotic
   vegetation and their small spatial requirements, it is unlikely that
   they will thrive in urban areas unless gardening practices change to
   increase resource availability and provide refuges from predators. (C)

Abstract = {Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is a large and economically important crop
   in the Mediterranean area where the soil conservation is a priority.
   Some agricultural practices, as green covers, are a promising strategy
   to protect against erosion and to improve soil microbial biodiversity
   and physicochemical quality. Here, we investigated the long-term effects
   of natural green cover, established over 7 years, on the biological and
   physicochemical characteristics of a clay-loam soil under Mediterranean
   conditions. Samples were collected in an experimental an experimental
   Garnacha vineyard, locate in Mallorca (Spain), at two times points in a
   single year: pre-bud burst (T1) and blooming/flowering (T2). All samples
   were taken at the trafficked position at 0-10 cm depth. Natural green
   cover resulted in an increment of 1\% of organic carbon content, larger
   dry aggregate size and a reduction of 0.36 g cm(-3) of bulk density.
   That supposes a total accumulation, after 7 years of maintenance of the
   cover, of 5.471 MgC ha(-1)yr(-1) in the 0-10 cm layer. Furthermore,
   these changes were associated with higher functional microbial community
   diversity assessed using Biolog (TM) EcoPlates, and a higher density of
   mycorrhizal spores. We found that the microbial community from soil
   under green cover was able to degrade ten substances more than microbes
   from tillage soils. Moreover, cover soil can present double of spores of
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. All these results indicate that the
   long-term maintenance of the resident species improves the
   physicochemical and biological characteristics of the soil and provides
   beneficial agroecosystem services to vineyard.},

Abstract = {Minimisation of municipal solid waste and diversion from landfill are
   necessary for the UK to manage waste sustainably and achieve legislative
   compliance. A survey of householder attitudes and experiences of a trial
   for minimising household food waste from waste collection in the county
   of West Sussex, UK is described. The minimisation method used the Green
   Cone food digester, designed for garden installation. A postal
   questionnaire was distributed to 1000 householders who had bought a cone
   during the trial and a total of 433 responses were received. The main
   reason for people buying the Green Cone had been concerns about waste
   (88\%), with 78\% and 67\% of respondents, respectively, claiming to
   have participated in recycling and home composting in the last 30 days.
   The waste material most frequently put in the digester was cooked food
   (91\%), followed by fruit waste, vegetable matter and bones/meat. Some
   respondents were using it for garden and animal waste from pets. Most
   users found the Green Cone performed satisfactorily. Approximately, 60\%
   of respondents had seen a reduction of 25-50\% in the amount of waste
   they normally put out for collection, with analysis showing reported
   levels of reduction to be significant (p < 0.05). Additional weight

   publicized as beneficial for residents with dementia, but we know little
   about these units and what makes them ``special.{''} Leveraging primary
   data from a national survey of nursing home representatives and the
   LTCfocus data, this study aims to describe characteristics and features
   of dementia specialty care units and examine variations in nursing home
   quality ratings. Design: National survey. Setting and Participants:
   Nationally, 256 nursing homes were randomly selected. Surveys with
   questions about dementia specialty care units were mailed to nursing
   home representatives in September/ November 2023. Methods: A total of
   166 surveys were returned from 126 nursing homes and compared with
   LTCfocus data. Descriptive statistics and qualitative analyses were used
   to analyze data. Results: A total of 105 (83.3\%) respondents
   corroborated with LTCfocus data (kappa 1/4 0.67, P < .05) regarding
   presence of dementia specialty care units. Of 21 respondents (16.7\%)
   not corroborating, inconsistencies were almost equal regarding
   directions of mismatching. Seventy-seven nursing homes had dementia
   specialty care units, 44\% of which were rated 4 to 5 stars for quality.
   Nonprofit nursing homes had higher star ratings compared with for-profit
   nursing homes. Wander gardens, interactive technologies, and restraints
   were used less frequently than personalized music, communal dining,
   locked units, outdoor access, and visiting animals on the units.
   Conclusions and Implications: Researchers using LTCfocus data to
   determine the presence of dementia specialty care units can be confident
   that designations are accurate. This study adds to our description of
   nursing home dementia specialty care units and provides insights into
   their presence in some nursing homes. Further research is needed to
   understand the relationship between profit status and quality ratings.

Title = {Global Invasion of Thrips parvispinus (Karny) (Thysanoptera:

Abstract = {Thrips parvispinus (Karny) is an exotic pest that has invaded many
   regions around the world in the last three decades. It was first
   detected in Florida in 2020 on ornamental plants (Hoya and Anthurium) in
   greenhouses and subsequently on ornamental plants in residential
   landscapes (Gardenia) in 2021. However, its first report on open
   vegetable field crops (Capsicum) in Florida was in 2022. We conducted
   field surveys and genetic analysis to answer three questions: (1) Is the
   population of T. parvispinus that invaded Florida the same as the one
   that has spread globally in the last few decades? (2) Is the host
   expansion to Capsicum in Florida a new population or the extension of
   the existing population reported on ornamental plants? and (3) What are
   the native and invaded distribution ranges of T. parvispinus? We
   analysed the genetic variation in the mitochondrial gene cytochrome
   oxidase I (COI) to address these questions. The global genetic diversity
   analysis of T. parvispinus revealed 18 haplotypes (populations)
   worldwide based on available data, but only one population (Hap1)
   invaded three continents: Africa, Europe, and North America. Based on
   available data, the highest haplotype diversity was observed in India,
   suggesting India may be part of the presumed native range (South and
   Southeast Asian countries) of T. parvispinus. Our survey of retail plant
   stores across 10 Florida counties indicated that plant trade is the
   source of T. parvispinus in open vegetable field crops and ornamental
   landscape plants. The outcome of this study will assist with regulatory
   and management decisions of T. parvispinus in Florida and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Since the mid-nineteenth century, poultry and livestock animals have
   increasingly been seen as out of place in, and excluded from, modern
   United States cities. Yet, since 2000, increasing numbers of urban
   residents have begun keeping chickens and other small livestock in
   backyards. Through an analysis of the re-emergence of this practice in
   Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, we show that chicken-keepers
   are not raising chickens simply to save money or to pursue an eccentric
   hobby, but rather as an explicit effort to promote and enact alternative
   urban imaginaries. Such imaginaries make possible alternative practices,
   and in turn, the performance of everyday practices reshapes urban
   imaginaries. In interviews, participants critique the industrial food
   system, urban economies and social life, and ``think differently{''}
   about human-animal relations and productive animals in cities. Through
   chicken-keeping practices, they establish sustainable backyard
   agro-ecosystems, build sociability, resist consumerism, and work
   simultaneously to improve the life and health of animals, humans, and
   the urban environment.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is an extreme form of habitat modification, but retention
   of native vegetation in bushland reserves may improve the ecological
   sustainability of cities. We focused on bats (Microchiroptera) and
   investigated the use of the urban matrix and surrounding bushland in a
   region of Sydney, Australia, where remnant bushland persists and gardens
   often support large trees. Ultrasonic surveys were conducted at 40 sites
   over one summer season in the backyard matrix, bushland remnants and
   surrounding National Parks to determine which species were present, and
   the influence of landscape elements and habitat characteristics on
   activity, species richness and presence of individual species. In total,
   15 of the 17 microbat species known from the Sydney region were recorded
   in the study area. Yet only three of these species, Chalinolobus
   gouldii, Mormopterus species 2 and Miniopterus schreibersii were present
   in more than 40\% of sites. Bat activity was significantly higher in
   remnant bushland on shale soils and in backyards, compared with
   sandstone gully and ridge remnants, or reference sites in nearby
   National Parks. Furthermore, species assemblages in urban areas were
   different from assemblages in reference sites. Of all the habitat
   characteristics examined, the amount of bushland within 0.5-3 km
   surrounding a site and tree density were the most common predictors of
   individual species presence, particularly rare species. Area of
   bushland, hollow abundance and average tree diameter were positively
   correlated with species richness, while tree diameter was the strongest
   predictor of total microbat activity. The proximity of large areas of
   bushland and the many trees remaining in residential areas of the
   northern `leafy' suburbs of Sydney allowed the persistence of a range of
   bat species. The higher bat activity on fertile shale soils indicated
   that bushland remnants embedded within cities can have high conservation
   value for bats. Surveys in more urbanized areas of Sydney are needed to
   test predictions of the models derived in this study.},

Abstract = {Rapid conversion of rural land to exurban development and the ensuing
   impacts on natural resources have been well-documented, but information
   about exurban landowners is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we
   surveyed exurban landowners in six Wyoming counties and documented
   demographic characteristics, motivations, knowledge, and attitudes about
   natural resources and land management. The overall response rate was
   55.6\%. Generally, respondents were of retirement age, had lived in
   Wyoming for about 13 yr, and were raised in areas with a population <
   10000. Wyoming respondents lived in exurbia for the lifestyle and
   aesthetic values and did not expect economic gains from their property.
   Most respondents had knowledge about, and interest in, invasive species,
   water quality, landscaping, and gardening. More than half of respondents
   (54\%) had never looked for information regarding land management.
   Information from this study can be used to strengthen the development
   and delivery of educational programs. Programs that focus on water
   quality or weed control likely will appeal to more exurban landowners
   than those that focus solely on grazing management. Our findings provide
   an accurate characterization of this audience and their motivations and
   attitudes regarding land management, and suggest that using a
   multipronged approach for outreach efforts, which includes both cost-
   and time-efficient ways to conduct important land management practices,
   might increase participation in educational programs.},

Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Context In residential landscapes, people acknowledge and manage larger,
   conventionally attractive plants differently than smaller, less
   conspicuous ones, possibly leading to a divergence in basic ecological
   patterns such as diversity-area relationships.Objectives We tested for
   divergences between lawn and non-lawn plants, and compared perceived and
   actual species richness in residential yards. We hypothesized that: (1)
   homeowner perception of plant species richness is more related to the
   actual species richness of non-lawn plants than lawn plants, and (2)
   alpha diversity will increase more rapidly, and beta diversity will
   decrease less rapidly for non-lawn plants than lawn plants with
   increasing spatial scale.Methods We recorded all plant species in four 5
   x 5 m plots in the front and back yards of 30 residences within four
   neighborhoods of Gainesville, Florida, United States (N = 238 plots). We
   also surveyed residents regarding perceived plant species richness in
   their yards.Results We detected 386 non-lawn and 140 lawn species.
   Perceived plant species richness was positively related to non-lawn
   species richness and negatively related to lawn species richness,
   suggesting perception of species richness largely reflected that of
   non-lawn plants. Alpha diversity increased more rapidly, while beta
   diversity decreased less rapidly, for non-lawn plants than lawn plants
   with increasing spatial scale, although lawns had more species within
   individual yards.Conclusions Findings revealed a divergence in
   diversity-area relationships between different plant groups in
   residential landscapes. We should consider the ecological implications
   of unrecognized plant diversity, particularly in residential lawns,
   where management often strives to limit plant species richness.},

Abstract = {Private residential property occupies a major part of the urban land
   base, yet considerable potential remains for improving the ecological
   performance of private gardens and landscapes. Ecologically-oriented
   approaches to design of residential properties, however, are only
   valuable if they are compatible with private landowner interests and
   needs-otherwise they may never be implemented. Landscape designers would
   benefit from more comprehensive guidance for ecologically-oriented
   planting design that best fits within residential settings. This paper
   identifies plant-based design strategies that may improve avian species
   richness, reviews scientific literature supporting these options, and
   describes three years of structured design research to evaluate how
   these strategies can be compatible with the programmatic and aesthetic
   goals of residential landowners. We worked with three New York State
   communities beginning with a community/neighborhood-scale visioning and
   goal setting process and ending with parcel-scale landscape designs. The
   project, in total, developed residential landscape designs for 50
   private properties, each incorporating urban ecological benefits in
   combination with the interests and needs of the owner. We share here a
   set of planting design strategies for enhancing avian habitat on
   residential private property generated during this process. They include
   planting strategies that: a) contribute to landscape networks; b) build
   vegetative structure at sites; c) provide microrefugia; d) optimize
   forage resource availability; and e) enhance plant diversity.
   Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of design results for the
   strategies is discussed.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As urbanization progresses globally, there is a growing concern
   regarding the diminishing connection between humans and nature. Informal
   green spaces (IGS) have been identified as a potential solution to this,
   offering unscripted opportunities for urban residents to engage with
   nature in a way that is not possible in formally planned parks and
   gardens. Despite an increasing focus on IGS, we are still developing our
   understanding of the extent to which people use these spaces to interact
   with nature. Our work addresses this research gap by employing a spatial
   analysis method to map IGS within Greater Melbourne, Australia. We used
   citizen science data to analyse the location and density of human-nature
   interactions on IGS compared to formal green spaces, as well as
   comparing different types of IGS and formal green spaces. Our findings
   revealed no significant difference in the density of citizen science
   observations between IGS and formal green spaces, once the variance in
   available area of each land use is accounted for. Notably, railway and
   utility easements exhibited the highest density of citizen science
   observations among all types of IGS. This research demonstrates that IGS
   make an important contribution to urban green space networks and
   additional thought should be given to how urban planning and land
   management may further increase the value of these spaces for people
   interacting with nature.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Creating sustainable urban landscapes in light of growing population
   pressures requires interdisciplinary multi-functional solutions.
   Alternative agro-ecosystems described as food forests, permaculture
   gardens, and/or edible landscapes among others could offer potential
   ways to address the social, economic, and ecological goals of various
   stakeholders simultaneously. Current research is lacking a comprehensive
   tool that can assess the performance of alternative agro-ecosystems that
   have both functional and aesthetic values. The present research uses a
   novel rubric, the Permaculture and Agro-ecosystems Sustainability
   Scorecard (PASS) that combines agricultural sustainability and ecosystem
   services (ES) indicators in order to assess alternative agro-ecosystems.
   The rubric evaluates provisioning, regulating, supporting, economic and
   cultural ES and includes benefits such as pollinator presence, increased
   biodiversity, alternative pesticides and fertilizer use, carbon
   sequestration, food security, and human interactions. Based on the
   concepts and principles drawn from four popular frameworks and
   sub-disciplines, namely, SAFE, SITES, permaculture, and agroecology, we
   identify sixteen broad ES indicators and 59 sub-indices and measure them
   using data collected through site observation, survey, interviews, and
   documentary research. For easy comparison across different urban
   agriculture sites, the above sub-indices are further aggregated into
   five ES criteria using stakeholder-informed weights. The weights are
   developed through pair-wise comparison of criteria by sample survey
   respondents. The PASS framework is used to score twelve sites in South
   Florida that meet specific criteria in the small farm, residential, and
   public space categories. Sample respondents place the highest weight on
   cultural services. Contrary to the popular notion of promoting urban
   agriculture for food security, the results show that the majority of the
   sites score highest in the supporting services provided, followed by
   regulating and cultural services, and lowest in the economic services
   category. The supporting service for most of the sample sites score
   consistently very high, close to the highest possible level of 5.0.
   There is a wide variation in provisioning and economic values across the
   study sites. The paper offers several ideas for mainstreaming the ES
   indicators into urban planning and decision-making and some of the
   practical difficulties one might face along the way. We conclude that in
   order to realize the broader ES benefits of urban agriculture in
   particular and agro-ecosystems in general, a multi-pronged policy and
   planning approach is necessary.},

Title = {The `Bush Capital'-A Review of 100+ Years of Integrative Spatio-Temporal
   Planning for a City in the Landscape and Nature in the City},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Over approximately 100 years, the Australian capital, Canberra, has
   evolved in association with the predominant values, vision and cultural
   relationships of people to the area. The location and design of the city
   derived from a formal intention to integrate nature and culture for the
   benefit and edification of residents and in symbolisation of the city's
   importance as the seat of national decision-making and legislature.
   Established on a native grassland surrounded by wooded hills and ridges,
   and with nearby confluences of rivers as security of water supply, the
   city's landscape was transformed through centralised planning and
   implementation of Garden City and City Beautiful constructs to become
   one of the world's most liveable regions. Twentieth-century expansion of
   the city's suburbs, tree streetscapes and gardens progressed with
   varying emphasis on exotic versus native species, and contemporary
   programs aim to increase urban tree canopy cover to 30\%. Yet, there is
   increasing acknowledgement of the landscape's rich history of
   culture-nature interactions extending back at least 25,000 years.
   Indicators are evident in human modification of tree-dominated
   ecosystems, the overlapping ways in which people related to elemental
   landscape features, and a continuity of valuing particular sites for
   ceremonies, social activities and human movement. With projected steady
   population growth, climate change, and associated impacts on the
   environment and natural resources, contemporary planning must be
   innovative and integrative to ensure ecologically sustainable
   development. Strong visionary leadership is needed to develop a
   landscape policy that encompasses key natural assets including
   threatened woodlands and mature native trees for their intrinsic values
   and as habitat for threatened fauna, cultural landscape values such as
   forested montane and ridge areas, and heritage and protected trees. From
   pre-European to current times, planning, modification and management of
   environmental and ecosystem values has been integral to enabling local
   people to sustain themselves. The next challenge is to create clarity
   about the future of this cultural landscape and enhance the community's
   attachment to and stewardship of the city and its landscape.},

   Coral Reefs in the Northwestern Gulf of Mexico},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 27},
Abstract = {Offshore coral reefs in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) are unique model
   systems for examining the mechanisms structuring reef fish communities
   due to their substantial geographic isolation, and the presence of
   replicate experimental units of both low (mid-shelf) and high coral
   diversity (shelf-edge) reefs. Here, we examined the species assemblage
   structure of juvenile and adult fishes at two mid-shelf reefs (Sonnier
   and Stetson Bank) and two shelf-edge reefs (East and West Flower Garden
   Banks) in the northwestern GOM to evaluate the relative importance of
   habitat (i.e., coral diversity) vs. recruitment in structuring resident
   fish assemblages. Visual reef fish surveys (n = 400) were conducted at
   the four coral reefs during two seasons, spring-early summer and late
   summer-fall in 2009 and 2010. Two depth zones were surveyed at each
   reef, representing the reef crest (15-23 m depth) and upper slope (23-30
   m depth) habitats. Seasonal variability in recruitment to both mid-shelf
   and shelf-edge reefs was observed, with higher mean juvenile density and
   diversity (H') observed during the late season at all reefs in 2009 and
   all but Stetson in 2010, supporting an early fall recruitment peak.
   Likewise, considerable inter-annual variability in juvenile recruitment
   was observed, with significantly lower juvenile density and H' observed
   at mid-shelf reefs in 2010 relative to 2009. Species diversity was
   strongly linked to coral diversity, with greater reef fish diversity
   consistently observed at shelf-edge relative to mid-shelf reefs.
   Observed differences in the composition of juvenile and adult
   assemblages at mid-shelf reefs suggest that reef fish communities at
   these reefs were more strongly influenced by post-settlement processes
   (e.g., juvenile mortality) than shelf-edge reefs, which may be a
   function of several limiting factors (e.g., predation, coral diversity,
   water quality). Results indicate that reef fish assemblages associated
   with mid-shelf and shelf-edge reefs in the northwestern GOM may have

   factors were identified and tested via a questionnaire survey conducted
   in Taiwan. Participants (N = 380) evaluated the importance level of the
   proposed factors with five-point Likert scale. Friedman Ranking Test and
   Kruskal-Wallis Test were used to analyse data. The results showed that
   ease of maintenance, regulation compliance and energy saving were the
   top factors for all participants. These are the economic advantage,
   bidder characteristics and environmental awareness concerns. Life cycle
   design and water retention and detention factors were evaluated as the
   critical factors from the potential housing developer and buyers. Green
   infrastructure connection and neighbourhood connection were ranked as
   very important factors for landscape architects. Landscape architects to
   practice with license and use LIM/BIM in project was particularly
   expected by the potential housing buyers with high importance level. The
   preliminary findings of this research can assist public housing agency
   and private developers for policy and decision making effectively in

Abstract = {Activity level, or the amount of action/interaction with a product, can
   be an indication of interest in a product category and influences
   purchases. Our goal was to assess the overall market for landscape
   plants using consumers' activity level from the active/passive continuum
   proposed by Pine and Gilmore (2011). An online survey instrument was
   administered to invitees from a national online panel from 7 to 13 Sept.
   2016 yielding 1543 useful responses. Factor analysis of 23 items adapted
   from a previous study revealed five factors, including one active factor
   and a separate passive factor. These two factors were used in the
   present study as a basis for a k-means cluster analysis. Two clusters
   emerged and were labeled ``Active Engagement'' and ``Obligatory Passive
   Engagement'' in landscape activities. We compared cluster means for all
   five factors and found the Active cluster purchased more plants of all
   types as well as had greater landscape pride and desire for a low
   (water) input landscape. Members of the Active cluster were from higher
   income and education households which were slightly larger and more
   likely to have Caucasian residents compared with the Passive cluster. In
   practice, retail employees and landscape professionals might initially
   ask about consumers' activity level desired in the landscape as a
   screening question. Subsequent assistance in design and/or plant
   selection/purchase could then be tailored toward the desired activity
   level.},

Abstract = {Little is known of the motives of residents for planting and removing
   garden trees in Western cities and nothing is known of the motives
   related to planting and removing different types of trees. We test the
   hypotheses that attitudes towards trees are reflected in the planting
   and removal of trees in general and of different types of urban trees,
   and that attitude syndromes are related to socioeconomic, demographic
   and spatial characteristics. A questionnaire asked for information on
   motives for planting and removing trees in general, and on actual
   planting and removal of trees in the last five years. Responses to
   questions about motives, to other questions on the values and problems
   of trees, and to a photo-elicitation section were numerically classified
   to derive seven classes of residents: aesthetes; spiritual tree lovers;
   practical tree lovers; arboriphobes: native wildlife lovers; tree hazard
   minimisers; and indifferents. Membership of classes was influenced by
   income, tertiary education and gender, but not age, negative experiences
   of trees or ownership status, indicating that attitudes may be
   relatively durable and not easily amenable to change. Attitudes tended
   to be expressed in actions. Variation between attitude groups in the
   types of trees they prefer combined with turnover of property ownership
   may be responsible for a lack of old urban trees. Urban planners and
   land managers interested in influencing resident decisions about private
   trees need to address variation in attitudes between different segments
   of the population. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study compares caterpillar communities (Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera
   sawflies) in agricultural hedgerows dominated by aggressive non-native
   plants (novel hedgerows) and hedgerows comprised largely of indigenous
   plants. It differs from controlled common garden studies because it
   examines the impact of evolutionarily novel plants that have replaced
   native plants in unmanaged ecosystems and thus provides a more accurate
   measure of what is happening to interactions between plants and insects
   in invaded natural areas. Four hedgerows of each treatment were searched
   methodically along 100m transects during June and July 2011 for a
   seasonal total of 500min each. Seasonal totals of species richness,
   caterpillar abundance, and caterpillar biomass were recorded and
   compared using linear mixed models. We also estimated a Lepidoptera
   productivity index for each hedgerow based on the plant species
   composition and biomass as well as literature host records for each
   species present. Although we found similar richness of plant species,
   and more plant biomass in novel hedgerows, novel hedgerows had 68\%
   fewer caterpillar species, 91\% fewer caterpillars, and 96\% less
   caterpillar biomass than native hedgerows. Moreover, novel hedgerows
   were predicted to have 5.4 times less Lepidoptera productivity based on
   their plant composition. Interactions between caterpillars and hedgerow
   plants were also significantly impacted by introduced plants, with novel
   hedgerows supporting 84\% fewer interactions between plants and
   caterpillars and 57\% less interaction diversity than native hedgerows.
   This is a considerably larger impact of novel plants on a critical
   component of terrestrial food webs than has been measured in common
   garden experiments at the same location and demonstrates that
   plant-herbivore interactions are compromised when novel species replace
   resident species, even if plant species richness does not change.},

Title = {Linking Foraging Decisions to Residential Yard Bird Composition},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Urban bird communities have higher densities but lower diversity
   compared with wildlands. However, recent studies show that residential
   urban yards with native plantings have higher native bird diversity
   compared with yards with exotic vegetation. Here we tested whether
   landscape designs also affect bird foraging behavior. We estimated
   foraging decisions by measuring the giving-up densities (GUD; amount of
   food resources remaining when the final forager quits foraging on an
   artificial food patch, i.e seed trays) in residential yards in Phoenix,
   AZ, USA. We assessed how two yard designs (mesic: lush, exotic
   vegetation; xeric: drought-tolerant and native vegetation) differed in
   foraging costs. Further, we developed a statistical model to calculate
   GUDs for every species visiting the seed tray. Birds foraging in mesic
   yards depleted seed trays to a lower level (i.e. had lower GUDs)
   compared to birds foraging in xeric yards. After accounting for bird
   densities, the lower GUDs in mesic yards appeared largely driven by
   invasive and synanthropic species. Furthermore, behavioral responses of
   individual species were affected by yard design. Species visiting trays
   in both yard designs had lower GUDs in mesic yards. Differences in
   resource abundance (i.e., alternative resources more abundant and of
   higher quality in xeric yards) contributed to our results, while
   predation costs associated with foraging did not. By enhancing the GUD,
   a common method for assessing the costs associated with foraging, our
   statistical model provided insights into how individual species and bird
   densities influenced the GUD. These differences we found in foraging
   behavior were indicative of differences in habitat quality, and thus our
   study lends additional support for native landscapes to help reverse the
   loss of urban bird diversity.},

Abstract = {Urban processes lead to species loss. Palmas is a young city under
   construction; thus, it provides a rare opportunity to analyze changes in
   bird richness in a developing city. Eighty city blocks, which were
   classified into five different categories according to different levels
   of urbanization, were sampled. Bird counting took place during a dry
   season and a rainy season in four parallel transects in each block. In
   these blocks, we estimated 20 variables related to woody vegetation,
   land cover and type of urban use. The estimated bird species richness
   for the study area was very high (151 species); nevertheless, species
   reduction occurred as a function of the urbanization processes. Although
   representing only 11\% of the city surface, the not-urbanized blocks
   showed the highest species richness, which corresponded to 96.3\% of the
   richness estimated in the city. The average species richness for most
   trophic groups, families, open-field or forest species and resident or
   migratory species decreased significantly in urbanized blocks. According
   to a Hierarchical Partitioning analysis the environmental variables that
   made the greatest positive contribution to the variation in bird species
   richness in urbanized blocks were the percentage of block area planned
   for residential use, the density of native trees and the percentage area
   covered by unpaved roads, whereas the commercial block density, the
   density of exotic trees and the percentage of block area built had the
   greatest negative contribution. Based on our results, policies aimed to
   maintain Cerrado native species in urbanized blocks would contribute to
   reduce bird species loss. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that mosquitoes help shape urban residents'
   perspectives on and interactions with their human neighbours and the
   larger physical environment. A total of twenty-two residents of six
   Washington, D.C.-area neighbourhoods participated in interviews about
   mosquito management and community environmental issues. Participants
   came from households enrolled in a larger study about mosquito ecology
   and management. This and other studies have found that conventional
   mosquito-prevention education has mixed and sometimes counterproductive
   or unexpected impacts on resident attitudes and practices towards
   mosquito management. We found that residents constructed lay ecological
   knowledge to explain the place of mosquitoes in shifting urban
   socio-natures. Participants' relational understanding of mosquitoes
   indicates that management interventions focusing on individual education
   and private space are insufficient. Overall, residents expressed concern
   about changing numbers, species, and vector potential of mosquitoes.
   They reported altering their own use of outdoor spaces due in part to
   concerns about mosquitoes but also expressed longing for renewed social
   and environmental engagement. Many participants also suspected their
   neighbours of practices that worsened infestations. To reshape
   traditional public health strategies, this paper proposes that health
   educators pursue community-based strategies that build upon residents'
   lay knowledge and concerns, which may inspire engagement with urban
   socio-natures beyond their own backyards.},

Abstract = {The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh 1867) (Diptera:
   Tephritidae), is an economically important pest of apples (Malus
   domesica Borkh.) (Rosaceae) throughout much of the United States. The
   fly is endemic to the eastern U.S., where its primary host plants are
   several species of native hawthorns (Crataegus spp.) (Rosaceae). About
   150 years ago the fly shifted to apples in the Northeast. More recently,
   the fly has been introduced to the western U.S. outside of its native
   range. In the state of Colorado, R. pomonella attacks the fruits of a
   number of different native and introduced hawthorn species, but is
   generally absent from apples. While orchards in apple growing regions
   are closely monitored, backyard and non-commercial apples often go
   largely unexamined. Here, we report results from a survey of
   non-commercial apples at 16 locations in eight counties across Colorado.
   We document the discovery of one R. pomonella infestation of apple at
   low density in Boulder, Colorado in close proximity to highly attacked,
   introduced downy hawthorn (C. mollis Scheele) in a residential
   neighborhood. Our finding represents the first confirmed infestation of
   apple in the state in 25 years. We discuss the implication of our
   findings for apple maggot management.},

Year = {2002},
Volume = {5},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Losses of forest cover, biodiversity, agricultural productivity, and
   ecosystem services in the Himalayan mountain region are interlinked
   problems and threats to the sustainable livelihoods of 115 x 106
   mountain people as well as the inhabitants of the adjoining
   Indo-gangetic plains. Until the 1970s, environmental conservation, food
   security, and rural economic development were treated as independent
   sectors. The poor outcomes of sector-oriented approaches catalyzed
   efforts to address environmental and socioeconomic problems
   concurrently. The identification of ``key{''} natural resource
   management interventions is an important dimension of integrated
   management. Projects to rehabilitate the degraded lands that cover 40\%
   of the Indian Himalaya could be key interventions provided that they
   address both socioeconomic and environmental concerns across spatial and
   temporal scales. However, projects of this type, e.g., investments in
   conifer plantations on degraded forest lands, have failed because their
   designs did not take into account the needs of local residents. This
   study illustrates a case of land rehabilitation in a small isolated
   village close to the alpine zone. Vital elements of this project
   strategy included identifying local perceptions and knowledge and
   involving the local people in the selection and implementation of the
   interventions needed to restore the land. Communities were found to be
   more concerned with the immediate economic benefits from bamboo and
   medicinal species than the long-term benefits of tree planting. The
   villagers eventually reached a consensus to plant broadleaved
   multipurpose trees in association with bamboo and medicinal species.
   Despite assurances that all the economic benefits from rehabilitation
   would go to the community, the people would not agree to voluntary
   labor, although they did absorb significant costs by providing social
   fencing, farmyard manure, and propagules from community forests.
   Households shared costs and benefits according to traditional norms. The
   economic benefits to the local people exceeded the rehabilitation cost
   over the 7-yr life of the project. There were significant on-site
   environmental benefits in terms of improvements in soil fertility,
   biodiversity, protective cover, and carbon sequestration, and off-site
   benefits from more productive use of labor, reduced pressure on
   protected areas, and the introduction of rare and threatened medicinal
   species onto private farmland.},

Abstract = {Creating or restoring habitat is a well-established approach to improve
   pollinator populations. Rural and exurban properties might constitute a
   straightforward opportunity to convert land to native plants that are
   beneficial to pollinators given that, in Ohio, these parcels typically
   contain substantial lawn cover. The purpose of this study is to gauge
   the public's acceptance of planting native plants on low-density rural
   properties. Out of 7557 properties in Butler County, Ohio (U.S.A.), that
   had at least 1/4 acre lawn, were between 1 and 20 acres, and had a
   dwelling, 200 were randomly selected to receive a survey; half via the
   drop-off pick-up method and half via mail (for a combined 58\% response
   rate). Pollinator beneficial plants of differing appearance, management,
   and pollinator service were shown in the questionnaire: Echinacea
   purpurea, Monarda fistulosa, Asclepias syriaca, and wildflower prairie
   (multiple species). Respondents were significantly less likely to be
   willing to plant Asclepias syriaca compared to the other plants shown.
   If all respondents planted what they said they would consider planting
   in the more accepted plants, these potentially new plantings would cover
   5.4\% of the 146.2 km(2) devoted to these rural and exurban parcels in
   the county. However, that proportion decreases to 1\% if we only take
   into account those that said they would make those changes within the
   year. We discuss what we see as challenges and opportunities to increase
   pollinator plantings on exurban properties and small working farms in

Abstract = {Cold-hardy citrus has gained prominence in North Florida's fresh market.
   North Florida is less exposed to Huanglongbing and citrus canker than
   the rest of the state, but is more exposed to freezing events. Following
   the exceptional frost that occurred in December 2022, a two-year survey
   (2023-2024) assessed the abundance and seasonal patterns of citrus pests
   in three groves and in residential backyard citrus across North Florida.
   Citrus leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera:
   Gracillariidae) dominated all groves, while the Asian citrus psyllid,
   Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), was recorded in
   backyard trees. The December 2022 frost had a minimal impact on ambrosia
   beetle and red scale populations, while the citrus leafminer population
   surged in the summer of 2023 compared to 2024. D. citri populations
   showed no significant seasonal or interannual fluctuations. Forecasting
   models exhibited strong accuracy for red scales and ambrosia beetles but
   higher error rates for citrus leafminers and D. citri, indicating
   varying degrees of temporal variability and persistence in their
   population dynamics. This study highlights species-specific responses to
   climatic shifts and informs targeted pest management strategies for
   North Florida's citrus industry.

Abstract = {Cat predation of birds in residential landscapes is ephemeral,
   unpredictable, and spatially dispersed, and thus requires many
   person-hours to observe. We sought to identify whether specific
   behaviors, traits, or feeding ecologies of birds contribute to their
   probability of cat-caused mortality around residences across temperate
   North America. In addressing this question, we evaluated citizen science
   data with respect to peer-reviewed species accounts (Birds of North
   America, BNA). Using information on cat predation from the BNA, we found
   that species that glean their prey from the ground or breed in nest
   boxes were three times more likely to be depredated by cats, while birds
   that hawk were over two times less likely to become cat prey than would
   be predicted by random chance. Data from citizen science sources also
   showed that birds using nest boxes had increased susceptibility to cat
   predation, as did those that use feeders and that glean from foliage. We
   caution that observations of predation by citizen science volunteers may
   be biased towards detection at feeders. Future research should focus on
   developing volunteer survey techniques for improving estimates of bird
   mortality rates and sources.},

Abstract = {Understanding how threatened species adapt their behavior to landscapes
   shaped by humans is increasingly important to ensuring they persist in a
   changing world. Matrix habitats can be shared spaces where human and
   nonhuman primates coexist. We set out to determine how an endemic,
   threatened forest specialist, the frugivorous, arboreal samango monkey
   (Cercopithecus albogularis labiatus), has responded to a matrix habitat
   made up of residential gardens and commercial plantations in Eastern
   Cape province, South Africa. We followed two groups from dawn to dusk
   for a mean of 3 days/mo for 12 mo (February 1, 2011 to January 31, 2012)
   using scan sampling to collect data on their diet, activity, and ranging
   patterns. We used resource abundance transects to describe the groups'
   home ranges and monitored tree phenology to calculate fruit and seed
   availability indices. Monkeys from both groups consumed large quantities
   of exotic plant species, accounting for > 50\% of their overall annual
   diet, with seeds of the invasive black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) the most
   commonly consumed exotic species followed by acorns of two oak species
   (Quercus robur and Q. palustris.). However, monkeys responded to the
   availability of indigenous rather than exotic fruits and seeds and
   increased their consumption of exotics when indigenous fruits were less
   available. Although monkeys spent less time moving when feeding on
   exotic species compared to indigenous species, eating exotics did not
   free up monkeys' time to rest or socialize, as additional time was
   required to process exotic foods. To offset the possible negative
   consequences of the monkeys' reliance on exotic seeds, including
   escalating conflict between monkeys and people in gardens, we suggest
   gradual removal of exotic plant species in the habitat and replacement
   with indigenous species as one mitigation strategy.},

Abstract = {A detailed knowledge of the habitat requirements of steppe birds living
   in farmland habitats is necessary to identify agricultural practices
   compatible with their conservation. The globally threatened Great
   Bustard Otis tarda is a partial migrant in central Iberia, but factors
   affecting its winter habitat use have not been identified. We assessed
   habitat differences between breeding and wintering areas and winter
   habitat selection of radiotagged migrant female Great Bustards in
   central Spain. Of 68 tagged females, 35\% moved to wintering areas
   located 64.3 +/- 24.0 km south of their breeding areas, and 80\%
   wintered in a single area of c. 236 km2. A census of the population in
   this area identified it as one of the most important wintering areas of
   this species in the world, holding c. 1500 individuals. There were
   significant differences between breeding and wintering habitats of
   individually marked migrant females. Compared with breeding areas,
   wintering areas of migrant females were located further from roads and
   urban nuclei, had lower human population densities and area of urban
   developments, and a higher diversity of land-use types, with less cover
   of cereals and more vineyards and olive groves. Within this area,
   radiotracked migrant females preferred sites with more vineyards and a
   lower land-use diversity. Our results highlight the importance of
   traditional Mediterranean dry farmland mosaics, and suggest that
   different conservation strategies are needed for migrant and resident
   populations in winter to secure the conservation of suitable wintering
   habitat for Great Bustards in the Iberian Peninsula.},

Volume = {109},

Abstract = {Floral resources (nectar and pollen) provide food for insect pollinators
   but have declined in the countryside due to land use change. Given
   widespread pollinator loss, it is important that we quantify their food
   supply to help develop conservation actions. While nectar resources have
   been measured in rural landscapes, equivalent data are lacking for urban
   areas, an important knowledge gap as towns and cities often host diverse
   pollinator populations.
   We quantified the nectar supply of urban areas, farmland and nature
   reserves in the UK by combining floral abundance and nectar sugar
   production data for 536 flowering plant taxa, allowing us to compare
   landscape types and assess the spatial distribution of nectar sugar
   among land uses within cities.
   The magnitude of nectar sugar production did not differ significantly
   among the three landscapes. In urban areas the nectar supply was more
   diverse in origin and predominantly delivered by non-native flowering
   plants. Within cities, urban land uses varied greatly in nectar sugar
   production. Gardens provided the most nectar sugar per unit area and
   85\% of all nectar at a city scale, while gardens and allotments
   produced the most diverse supplies of nectar sugar. Floral abundance,
   commonly used as a proxy for pollinators' food supply, correlated
   strongly with nectar resources, but left a substantial proportion of the
   variation in nectar supply unexplained.
   Synthesis. We show that urban areas are hotspots of floral resource
   diversity rather than quantity and their nectar supply is underpinned by
   the contribution of residential gardens. Individual gardeners have an
   important role to play in pollinator conservation as ornamental plants,
   usually non-native in origin, are a key source of nectar in towns and
   cities.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly modified Earth's social-ecological
   systems in many ways; here we study its impacts on human-nature
   interactions. We conducted an online survey focused on peoples'
   relationships with the non-human world during the pandemic and received
   valid responses from 3,204 adult residents of the state of Vermont
   (U.S.A.). We analyzed reported changes in outdoor activities and the
   values associated with human-nature relationships across geographic
   areas and demographic characteristics. We find that participation
   increased on average for some activities (foraging, gardening, hiking,
   jogging, photography and other art, relaxing alone, walking, and
   watching wildlife), and decreased for others (camping, relaxing with
   others). The values respondents ranked as more important during the
   pandemic factored into two groups, which we label as ``Nurture and
   Recreation values{''} and ``Inspiration and Nourishment values.{''}
   Using multinomial logistic regression, we found that respondents'
   preferences for changes in activity engagement and value factors are
   statistically associated with some demographic characteristics,
   including geography, gender, income, and employment status during the
   pandemic. Our results suggest that nature may play an important role in
   coping during times of crisis, but that the specific interactions and
   associated values that people perceive as most important may vary
   between populations. Our findings emphasize for both emergency and
   natural resources planning the importance of understanding variation in
   how and why people interact with and benefit from nature during crises.},

Abstract = {Bird-window collisions at houses have been identified as a significant
   source of mortality for North American birds, but which types of houses
   and windows are most problematic remains poorly understood. We assessed
   how neighborhood type, yard conditions, house attributes, and window
   type influenced collision rates. Data were collected from citizen
   scientists across Alberta, Canada, who surveyed their houses daily. In
   relation to the best-fitting model, the yard model explained 58.1\% of
   the explained deviance, the neighborhood model 45.6\%, and the house
   model 42.6\%. The factors that had the largest effect for predicting
   collision risk included season and whether the house was in a rural or
   an urban area (rural areas in the fall had a 6.0x higher collision risk
   than urban areas in the winter), the height of vegetation in the front
   yard of the house (trees >2 stories high increased collision risk by
   3.6x compared to houses with no trees), and the presence of a bird
   feeder (which increased collision risk by 1.73). This suggests that
   multiple factors affect collision rates and that the suitability of a
   yard as bird habitat is likely a key driver. Given that few homeowners
   are likely to take an approach that reduces the number of birds in their
   yards, future focus needs to be given to bird-friendly urban design and
   developing the most effective window deterrents so that collisions can
   be reduced and birds enjoyed in urban environments.},

Abstract = {The bird community in urban areas indicates the species-specific
   adaptability to urban conditions such as the increase in man-made

   environmental predictors for the two bird groups assemblages in Depok,
   one of Jakarta's satellite cities. We used the point-count method to
   survey the birds in three habitat types, green spaces, residentials, and
   roadside, and then we used Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) to analyze the

   distributions for the urban adapters and urban exploiters based on
   several environmental predictors. Our results suggest that both urban

   Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) and cave swiflets (Collocalia
   linchi) were the most common species in all three habitat types. On
   average, canopy cover was most extensive in green spaces followed by
   residential and roadside areas. Urban exploiters were likely to have a
   high suitability extent compared to urban adapters. The distributions of
   both groups were affected by the distance to perennial water, then by

Abstract = {With the growth of urban areas, the fragments and trees present in this
   environment have become fundamental to the conservation of biodiversity,
   as they provide food and nesting sites. The availability of breeding
   sites in hollows in an area is a determining factor in the reproductive
   success of several species that require this resource. This study aims
   to evaluate the dynamics of use of dead palm tree trunks as nests by Ara
   ararauna, the blue-and-yellow macaw, over seven breeding seasons in the
   urban perimeter of Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul. Data were collected
   between 2011 and 2017. One hundred and forty-six natural nests were
   recorded, mainly in house yards (55.5\%) and public areas (32.9\%). The
   nests were built on dead palm trees of five tree species: macauba palm
   (Acrocomia aculeata), moriche palm (Mauritia flexuosa), fishtail palm
   (Caryota urens), imperial palm (Roystonea oleracea), and babassu palm
   (Attalea speciosa). Forty-six natural nests were lost, which
   corresponded to 31.5\% of the nests recorded. Just over half of these
   nests were removed by the residents (58.7\%), while the remaining fell
   naturally (41.3\%). Considering the importance of the vegetation present
   in residential yards and public areas, particularly palm trees for
   breeding and feeding of A. ararauna, it is important to conserve them
   and encourage the planting of native palm trees in the city.},

Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {760-771},
Abstract = {The compact city approach has gained global impact as a planning
   approach for sustainable development in areas with increasing urban
   population. Through densification and compact building, the approach
   aims to counteract negative effects of urban sprawl in terms of
   ineffective land-use and related environmental problems. In spite of its
   benefits various problems and challenges are associated with
   implementing the compact city approach. This review looks at the effects
   of urban densification and compact city development on urban green space
   and its planning. It identifies problems, challenges and strategies of
   urban green space planning during densification processes. Findings
   confirm that urban densification processes, including consolidation and
   infill development, can pose a threat to urban green space. However, the
   literature on the compact city approach often lacks specific suggestions
   for urban green space conservation and planning. Provision of urban
   green space in compact city environments and during densification
   processes is described as a major challenge. Loss of private urban green
   space rarely seems offset by provision of more public green space.
   Several ways are identified to deal with these challenges, while also
   highlighting research gaps, e.g., as to how loss of green space quantity
   can be offset by increased green space quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Title = {Predicting Summer Site Occupancy for an Invasive Species, the Common
   Brushtail Possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), in an Urban Environment},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Invasive species are often favoured in fragmented, highly-modified,
   human-dominated landscapes such as urban areas. Because successful
   invasive urban adapters can occupy habitat that is quite different from
   that in their original range, effective management programmes for
   invasive species in urban areas require an understanding of
   distribution, habitat and resource requirements at a local scale that is
   tailored to the fine-scale heterogeneity typical of urban landscapes.
   The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is one of New
   Zealand's most destructive invasive pest species. As brushtail possums
   traditionally occupy forest habitat, control in New Zealand has focussed
   on rural and forest habitats, and forest fragments in cities. However,
   as successful urban adapters, possums may be occupying a wider range of
   habitats. Here we use site occupancy methods to determine the
   distribution of brushtail possums across five distinguishable urban
   habitat types during summer, which is when possums have the greatest
   impacts on breeding birds. We collected data on possum presence/absence
   and habitat characteristics, including possible sources of supplementary
   food (fruit trees, vegetable gardens, compost heaps), and the
   availability of forest fragments from 150 survey locations. Predictive
   distribution models constructed using the programme PRESENCE revealed
   that while occupancy rates were highest in forest fragments, possums
   were still present across a large proportion of residential habitat with
   occupancy decreasing as housing density increased and green cover
   decreased. The presence of supplementary food sources was important in
   predicting possum occupancy, which may reflect the high nutritional
   value of these food types. Additionally, occupancy decreased as the
   proportion of forest fragment decreased, indicating the importance of
   forest fragments in determining possum distribution. Control operations
   to protect native birds from possum predation in cities should include
   well-vegetated residential areas; these modified habitats not only
   support possums but provide a source for reinvasion of fragments.},

Abstract = {Pesticides, common environmental exposures, have been examined in
   relation to breast cancer primarily in occupational studies or exposure
   biomarker studies. No known studies have focused on self-reported
   residential pesticide use. The authors investigated the association
   between reported lifetime residential pesticide use and breast cancer
   risk among women living on Long Island, New York. They conducted a
   population-based case-control study of 1,508 women newly diagnosed with
   breast cancer between August 1996 and July 1997 and 1,556 randomly
   selected, age-frequency-matched controls. Comprehensive residential
   pesticide use and other risk factors were assessed by using an
   in-person, interviewer-administered questionnaire. Unconditional
   logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95\%
   confidence intervals. Breast cancer risk was associated with ever
   lifetime residential pesticide use (odds ratio = 1.39, 95\% confidence
   interval: 1.15, 1.68). However, there was no evidence of increasing risk
   with increasing lifetime applications. Lawn and garden pesticide use was
   associated with breast cancer risk, but there was no dose response.
   Little or no association was found for nuisance-pest pesticides, insect
   repellants, or products to control lice or fleas and ticks on pets. This
   study is the first known to suggest that self-reported use of
   residential pesticides may increase breast cancer risk. Further
   investigation in other populations is necessary to confirm these
   findings.},

   Factors in fl uencing plant purchase decisions were measured using a

Abstract = {Over the last two decades, home garden studies have markedly increased

   its influence on the overall biodiversity of the urban green

   garden surveys were conducted in the North West and Gauteng Provinces of
   South Africa to contribute to this research focus. The two questions
   asked in this paper were: (1) Are Batswana garden designs associated
   with socioeconomic status (SES)? (2) Are the different garden designs
   characterized by specific plant species richness patterns? We
   hypothesized that SES influences garden design and that, as the SES of
   Batswana residents increases, the garden design changes from tshimo to
   colonial. Our results indicated that garden design reflected less
   cultural influences and took on a more Westernized colonial design
   appearance with improvement of SES of Batswana inhabitants. Tshimo
   gardens tended to have more native and utilitarian species. In contrast,
   colonial gardens have more alien ornamental species. In affluent areas,
   sampled Batswana gardens completely changed from a tshimo to colonial
   garden design. This change indicates that improved socioeconomic status

Abstract = {Awareness in the eyes of the public is important for involving the wider
   community in conservation. A dragonfly awareness trail was developed and
   implemented in the year 2000 at a national botanical garden in South
   Africa. Such a trail is not likely to always have the same number of
   dragonfly species either throughout the year or from one year to the
   next. The aim was to assess dragonfly assemblage changes that occurred
   along the trail over 3 years, so as to fine-tune expectations that the
   public may have as regards species to be seen at any particular time. A
   cumulative species variance for species and speciesenvironmental
   relations, strongly indicated that certain measured site variables were
   responsible for the main variation in dragonfly species patterns over
   time. Habitat requirements of an odonate species may be defined
   primarily in terms of marginal grasses, floating and submerged
   vegetation, marginal herbs, sedges and reeds, and pH. Additional
   variables were percentage shade, exposed rock, marginal forest and water
   flow characteristics. Both dragonfly species richness and abundance
   changed over the 3 years. One of the reasons for this was a single,
   major disturbance, in the form of dredging the reservoir site to reverse
   ecological succession in 2002. Despite an impact such as this, and after
   accounting for vagrancy, there were in all 24 `core resident species'
   still to be seen along the trail from January to May. Another 11
   species, including two migrants and one species lost temporarily to
   dredging disturbance, can be considered only as `possibilities' on any
   one visit. Assurance that the 24 core species can be seen in the summer
   months (although only three in winter) is essential for maintaining the
   bona fide of such a trail, and hence conservation awareness, in the eyes
   of the public.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {There is increasing interest in developing urban design principles that
   incorporate good ecological management. Research on understanding the
   distribution and role of beneficial pollinating insects, in particular,
   is changing our view of the ecological value of cities. With the rapid
   expansion of the built environment comes a need to understand how
   insects may be affected in extensive urban areas. We therefore
   investigated insect pollinator capture rates in a rapidly growing and
   densely urbanized city (Melbourne, Australia). We identified a remnant
   native habitat contained within the expansive urban boundary, and
   established study sites at two nearby populated urban areas. We employed
   standard pan trap sampling techniques to passively sample insect orders
   in the different environments. Our results show that, even though the
   types of taxonomic groups of insects captured are comparable between
   locations, important pollinators like bees and hoverflies were more
   frequently captured in the remnant native habitat. By contrast, beetles
   (Coleoptera) and butterflies/moths (Lepidoptera) were more frequently
   observed in the urban residential regions. Our results suggest that the
   maintenance of native habitat zones within cities is likely to be
   valuable for the conservation of bees and the ecosystem services they
   provide.},

Volume = {189},
Pages = {117-128},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Flowering bee lawns integrate low-growing flowers into mowed turfgrass
   to increase the availability of bee forage. They also maintain many of
   the aesthetic and recreational functions of the lawns in urban green
   spaces. Common cultural preferences for uniform, green,
   grass-monoculture lawns may pose a barrier to widespread adoption of
   flowering lawns. However, a growing body of literature suggests that
   there may be a higher degree of acceptance of lawn alternatives, such as
   grass-free lawns or urban meadows, than previously thought. We examined
   park visitors' perceptions of flowering lawns at four parks in
   Minneapolis, U.S. through an on-site questionnaire survey using photos.
   When first asked, 97.2\% of respondents supported implementing flowering
   lawns in public parks. Informing participants that flowering lawns are
   designed to provide bee forage had a polarizing effect where strong
   support increased yet overall support declined slightly. Positive
   perceptions of bees and of flowering lawn appearance were the only two
   significant factors associated with support for flowering lawns in both
   pre- and post-informational intervention logistic regression models.
   Similarly, aesthetics and benefits to bees were the most frequently
   stated perceived benefits. When asked about concerns, the most frequent
   responses were `no concerns' and `reduced recreational use of lawns'.
   For public land managers who wish to add flowering lawns to their suite
   of green infrastructure options to increase forage availability for
   bees, our findings suggest there is widespread public support. Public
   engagement should be carefully crafted to address concerns about
   flowering lawns and reinforce existing positive perceptions.},

   were collected through a primary survey and questionnaire method using a
   social preference approach (SPA). Correlation analysis and factor
   analysis were performed to assess the relationship between activities
   and services (benefits) provided by urban parks and to examine their
   most significant benefits. A Kruskal-Wallis (K-S test) test was
   performed to determine significant differences in the perceived
   valuations of park benefits. A benefit dominancy index (BDI) was also
   developed to determine which urban parks provide the most benefit. The
   findings of the study showed that (i) the urban parks were mostly used
   for spending time with relatives (partners) and friends, followed by
   mental refreshment and relaxation, physical activity, and spending time
   with children; (ii) there are substantial seasonal variations in park
   visits in the Jeddah megacity; (iii) socio-demographic attributes
   largely affect the use of urban parks; and (iv) there are also
   substantial discrepancies between importance and performance related to
   urban management strategies. Thus, the findings of this study show that

Abstract = {We examined whether environmental or social factors alone, or a
   combination of social ecological factors were more effective at
   explaining patterns in plant and bird assemblages across urban green
   spaces. Thirty publicly accessible, passive recreation greenspaces
   provided by municipal councils (i.e. city parks) were surveyed in a
   highly urbanised city - Sydney, Australia. Plant communities were
   influenced most by topography and park management approach, and to a
   lesser extent by land-use history. Greenspaces with greater topographic
   variation and that were co-managed with local citizen groups hosted
   higher plant species richness and abundance. Bird species richness
   within greenspaces increased with increasing distance from the central
   business district and decreasing distance from freshwater. Bird
   abundance was best explained by a combination of social-ecological
   factors, with abundance increasing with increasing site (greenspace)
   age, increasing percent concrete groundcover of a site and increasing
   proximity to the central business district. We identified a group of
   `rare city parks', dissimilar in ecological composition that hosted more
   complex and species rich plant communities compared to `common city
   parks'. We suggest this difference is likely because rare city parks
   received management and maintenance input from local citizen groups,
   whereas common city parks were managed and maintained exclusively by
   local councils. How different social factors, such as management
   approach and ongoing maintenance, are linked to the ecology of urban
   greenspaces are key areas for future investigation to help create
   sustainable urban landscapes that provide maximum benefits to urban

Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {208-216},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Pockets of green space in cities can provide important ecosystem
   services for urban residents. As naturalistic spaces in urban areas
   become increasingly sparse, communities are beginning to co-manage
   existing incidental pockets of land towards the creation of communal
   natural resources. Such green commons can be productive in terms of
   ecosystem services through targeted management such as in the case of
   urban agriculture. Although some work has been done to explore the
   motives behind and potential benefits of informal green space
   management, further research is required to understand those
   characteristics of site management and community input which contribute
   to the enhancement of site specific ecosystem service production. A case
   study of ten examples of community-managed green space was undertaken to
   evaluate the contributory factors relating to site character and
   management which influenced productivity as defined by the cumulative
   provision of four urban-relevant ecosystem services. The analysis
   revealed that the level of community involvement, measured as intensity
   of volunteer hours, was highly instrumental in the productivity of
   sites. Food production also proved to be catalytic for the enhancement
   of ecosystem services whereas extent of vegetative cover and increasing
   site size were, counter-intuitively, detrimental to overall site
   productivity. The study therefore supports the promotion of
   participatory approaches to the management of ecosystems services in
   urban areas, particularly those which take small-scale urban agriculture
   as a primary practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Land cover composition is a valuable indicator of the ecological
   performance of a city. Single-family housing areas constitute a
   substantial part of most cities and may as such play an important role
   for sustainable urban development. From aerial photos we performed
   detailed GIS-based mapping of land cover in three detached single-family
   housing areas in Denmark of different urban form but comparable housing
   densities (ranging from 10.0 to 11.3 houses per hectare). The findings
   were subjected to statistical analysis and landscape metrics. Land cover
   varied with urban form: A traditional spatial configuration with
   rectangular parcels contained significantly more vegetation and less
   impervious surfaces per parcel than newer Radburn-inspired
   configurations with more quadratic parcels. Correlation analysis showed
   size of paved access ways to be positively correlated with distance from
   road to carports in all parcels, and number of trees to be positively
   correlated with garden size in rectangular parcels. Correlation analysis
   also showed that higher trees were located further from houses, and that
   rectangular parcels could support more trees than quadratic parcels.
   These results suggest that the urban form of neighbourhoods to some
   degree predicts the long term land cover composition. We conclude that
   strategies for maximizing the ecological performance of single-family
   housing areas can be informed by knowledge on urban form, and that
   digital mapping of land cover based on aerial photography is a useful
   tool.},

Abstract = {Urbanisation modifies natural landscapes resulting in built-up space
   that is covered by buildings or hard surfaces and managed green spaces
   that often substitute native plant species with exotics. Some native bee
   species have been able to adapt to urban environments, foraging and
   reproducing in these highly modified areas. However, little is known on
   how the foraging ecology of native bees is affected by urbanised
   environments, and whether impacts vary among species with different
   degrees of specialisation for pollen collection. Here, we aim to
   investigate the responses of native bee foraging behaviour to
   urbanisation, using DNA metabarcoding to identify the resources within
   nesting tubes. We targeted oligolectic (specialist) and polylectic
   (generalist) cavity-nesting bee species in residential gardens and
   remnant bushland habitats. We were able to identify 40 families, 50
   genera, and 23 species of plants, including exotic species, from the
   contents of nesting tubes. Oligolectic bee species had higher diversity
   of plant pollen in their nesting tubes in residential gardens compared
   to bushland habitats, along with significantly different forage
   composition between the two habitats. This result implies a greater
   degree of forage flexibility for oligolectic bee species than previously
   thought. In contrast, the diversity and composition of plant forage in
   polylectic bee nesting tubes did not vary between the two habitat types.
   Our results suggest a complex response of cavity-nesting bees to
   urbanisation and support the need for additional research to understand
   how the shifts in foraging resources impact overall bee health.},

Title = {A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF PUBLIC GREEN SPACES IN THE CHANGING URBAN TEXTURE
   IN TERMS OF PREFERENCES FOR ORNAMENTAL PLANTS AND VISUAL QUALITY: THE
   CASE OF BARTIN (TURKEY)},
Journal = {FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {2326-2342},
Abstract = {The purpose of the present study is to identify the distribution of
   plant species in the urban public green spaces (UPGS's) of the urbanized
   area of Bartin, Turkey, and relate the make up of the vegetation to how
   residents perceive the open spaces both visually and in terms of green
   space sustainability. The study was conducted in 41 sampled areas in 18
   green spaces. These UPGS's were in both old and new urban areas, and
   were distributed throughout the urbanized area of Bartin. The survey
   found there were 193 plant species from 59 families in the 41 sampled
   areas.
   Based on this survey the present comparative study of UPGS's in both
   older areas and newer development in Bartin (a) presents the plant
   species as well as their distribution by family and origin, (b) makes
   correlations between the socio-demographics of survey participants and
   their definitions of urban UPGS's, (c) evaluates the sustainability of
   the UPGS's (on the basis of their aesthetic, ecological, and functional
   properties), and (d) assesses the visual quality of the UPGSs.
   A questionnaire was given to 350 participants, and the findings were
   assessed via a correlation analysis. The findings suggested, with a
   reliability level of 95\%, a statistically significant correlation
   between the socio-demographics of the participants and their preferences
   in the changing urban texture (p<0.05). It was determined that whereas
   users find UPGSs in older urban areas to be more beautiful, traditional
   and attractive than new parks and gardens in recently developed
   development (r=0,133{*}) while it was also determined that the plant
   texture is richer and has sufficient greenery (r=,176{*}{*}) in older
   urban areas. The Bartin public found the gardens of religious buildings
   in older areas to be more ecological with a score of 3.05 whereas the
   gardens of public buildings in modem developments were found to be more
   functional with a score of 3.7 and that park areas with old urban
   texture characteristics and cemetery areas with new urban texture
   characteristics were found to be more ecological both with scores of
   3.5. When the semantic differential method results are evaluated, it was
   determined that all expert groups found cemetery areas with both new and
   old urban texture characteristics to be accessible with a ratio of 32 \%
   and traditional with a ratio of 29 \%.
   UPGSs are an essential component of urban green space planning.
   Therefore, the present paper provides significant data for further
   studies on planning, designing and managing UPGSs. More specifically,
   the sustainability of the vegetation in the UPGSs included in the study
   is essential for urban ecology and urban planning. The paper concludes
   with recommendations for development of urban biodiversity, quality of
   human life, and sustainability of the urban landscape in public open
   spaces in a city, which is growing at a remarkable rate.},

Title = {Ethnobotanical study on factors influencing plant composition and
   traditional knowledge in homegardens of Laifeng Tujia ethnic
   communities, the hinterland of the Wuling mountain area, central China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2024},

Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {BackgroundA homegarden is a conventional small-scale agricultural
   ecosystem dominated predominantly by humans. Homegarden plants, which
   are plants with specific functionalities that are either cultivated or
   consciously preserved within the homegarden, are the most critical
   elements of the homegarden and are capable of providing a multitude of
   products and services. Recognized as one of China's biodiversity
   hotspots, the Wuling mountain area has long been inhabited by multiple
   ethnic groups, each of which has accumulated a wealth of traditional
   knowledge. This study focuses on the Tujia ethnic communities in Laifeng
   County, situated in the hinterland of the Wuling mountain area, with the
   primary objective of collecting, documenting, and organizing local
   homegarden plants, their functions, and the associated traditional
   knowledge, and exploring the factors influencing their composition and
   diversity.MethodsFrom May 2023 to August 2024, field surveys were
   conducted in Laifeng County, Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture,
   Hubei Province, China. Semi-structured interviews and participatory
   observation were used to gather information on homegarden plants with
   informed consent. To analyze and evaluate homegarden plants, we employed
   the relative frequency of citation (RFC) and Jaccard index (J) for
   quantitative analysis. Additionally, the factors influencing the
   composition of homegarden plants were investigated using redundancy
   analysis (RDA).ResultsThis study documented a total of 414 species of
   homegarden plants from 114 families. These plants are primarily sourced
   from market purchases (158), spontaneous species (107), wild
   introductions (103), neighborhood sharing (59), and self-preservation
   (36). Homegarden plants serve multiple functions, including ornamental
   (201), medicinal (189), edible (165), traded (95), timber (34), forage
   (28), and other functions (11). There are 24 homegarden plants with an
   RFC greater than 0.5, indicating their high importance, including Allium
   fistulosum, Raphanus sativus, and Brassica rapa var. chinensis. The
   Jaccard index results suggest the highest degree of similarity between
   the homegarden plants in Geleche Town and Dahe Town. The RDA results
   established that knowledge of herbal medicine and homegarden area are
   two significant factors impacting the composition and diversity of
   homegarden plants, with the average age of the household resident
   population also exerting an influence.ConclusionsThis study reveals the
   composition, source diversity, and functional diversity of homegarden
   plants within the Laifeng Tujia ethnic community, along with the
   influencing factors. These homegarden plants play an integral role in
   sustaining the balance of the homegarden ecosystem and supporting the
   daily lives of local residents. The management of homegarden plants by
   the Laifeng Tujia ethnic community carries traditional agricultural
   knowledge and wisdom. Emphasis should be placed on bolstering the
   understanding, protection, and transmission of traditional knowledge and
   culture related to homegardens, which play a vital role in safeguarding
   local agricultural biodiversity and fostering sustainable development.},

   ecosystem services and human wellbeing: A case study from Lefke Region
   of North Cyprus},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {102},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Ornamental plants and relevant horticulture practices provide essential
   environmental, economic, social, and aesthetic benefits for human
   wellbeing. However, the contribution of ornamental plants-based
   ecosystem services (ESs) to human wellbeing (HWB) has not yet been
   explored in detail. This study was carried out with the aim of
   contributing to this knowledge gap. Accordingly, the purpose of this
   study is to evaluate the relationship between ornamental plants
   based-ESs and HWB in a home garden context in Lefke Region of North
   Cyprus. The objectives of the study were (i) to identify the ornamental
   plant species cultivated in the home gardens, (ii) to evaluate the major
   ornamental plants-based ESs, (iii) to assess the contributions of the
   relevant ESs to the HWB, and (iv) to examine the interrelationship
   between the different categories of ESs and HWB. The conceptual
   framework of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and a social preference
   valuation approach were adopted to assess the ornamental plants-based
   ESs, their contributions to the components of HWB, and interrelations
   amongst them. A number of qualitative (e.g. semi-structured interviews)
   and quantitative (e.g. a questionnaire) research tools were employed to
   collect the relevant data. The quantitative data obtained from 170
   residents were evaluated using a 0-5 Likert Scale. The field surveys
   revealed that the composition of ornamental plants in the home gardens
   consists of 233 plant species. Evaluation of the quantitative data
   showed that the average relative value of the ornamental plants-based
   ESs varies between the categories of habitat-based ESs (4,08 points) and
   regulating ESs (3,00 points). This finding indicates the significant
   role of ornamental plants for `habitat formation' and `wildlife
   attraction'. The most tagged components were `habitats for pets' and
   `aesthetic quality'. The ornamental plants-based ESs particularly
   contribute to the two components of HWB: `security' (4,51 points) and
   `contact with nature' (4,37 points). The relationship between the ESs
   and HWB was quantified on a 1-5 Likert scale. A high degree of
   correlation was found between the categories of `provisioning services'
   and `basic material for a good life' and also between the categories of
   `cultural services' and `development of good social relations' with a
   4,96 points. The lowest degree of correlation was estimated to be
   between the categories of `regulating services' and `development good
   social relations' with a 1,01 points. The results of this study may
   contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between
   the ornamental plants-based ESs and HWB in Lefke Region and elsewhere.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study evaluates people's preferences regarding the proximity of
   their residence to agricultural urban green infrastructure (UGI), such
   as agricultural land and satoyama, and discusses the availability of
   these types of land as UGI. UGI is vital for reducing the negative
   environmental impacts of urban areas, as these impacts are too large to
   ignore. In this study, we conducted an online survey and a choice
   experiment to investigate people's perceptions regarding the proximity
   of their residence to agricultural UGI (AUGI). The respondents of the
   choice experiment were 802 inhabitants of Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan,
   which has rich agricultural resources. To examine explicitly the spatial
   autocorrelation of people's preferences, in this study, we used the
   spatial econometrics method. The main empirical findings are that people
   prefer agricultural land far away from their residence-more than 1000 m,
   not within 1000 m-which reflects the not-in-my-backyard phenomenon.
   Meanwhile, people's preferences regarding proximity to satoyama are
   complicated and their preferences are positively spatially
   autocorrelated. The results indicate that policymakers and urban
   planners should manage and provide AUGI far away from residential areas;
   otherwise, they must address people's avoidance of neighboring AUGI.},

Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Urban residents' health depends on green infrastructure to cope with
   climate change. Shrinking cities could utilize vacant land to provide
   more green space, but declining tax revenues preclude new park
   developmenta situation pronounced in Japan, where some cities are
   projected to shrink by over ten percent, but lack green space. Could
   informal urban green spaces (IGS; vacant lots, street verges,
   brownfields etc.) supplement parks in shrinking cities? This study
   analyzes residents' perception, use, and management preferences
   (management goals, approaches to participatory management, willingness
   to participate) for IGS using a large, representative online survey (n =
   1000) across four major shrinking Japanese cities: Sapporo, Nagano,
   Kyoto and Kitakyushu. Results show that residents saw IGS as a common
   element of the urban landscape and their daily lives, but their
   evaluation was mixed. Recreation and urban agriculture were preferred to
   redevelopment and non-management. For participative management,
   residents saw a need for the city administration to mediate usage and
   liability, and expected an improved appearance, but emphasized the need
   for financial and non-financial support. A small but significant
   minority (similar to 10\%) were willing to participate in management
   activities. On this basis, eight principles for participatory informal
   green space planning are proposed.},

Title = {Local plant richness predicts bee abundance and diversity in a study of
   urban residential yards},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {64-73},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding the drivers of biodiversity in cities is a central goal of
   urban ecology. There is currently intense scientific and public interest
   in the factors that influence pollinator diversity in cities and their
   surroundings. Existing studies point to a variety of landscape and local
   factors as potentially important, including urbanization (often defined
   as impervious surface cover in the surrounding lands), tree canopy cover
   and the diversity and abundance of locally flowering plants. However,
   few studies have sought to weigh the relative importance of these
   predictors of bee community metrics. Using a set of 27 residential yards
   chosen to represent a gradient of both urbanization and tree canopy
   cover at a landscape scale, we used pan trapping and netting to assess
   the abundance and diversity of local bee communities across the City of
   Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Surprisingly, the landscape factors
   (urbanization and tree cover) described only a tiny fraction (< 1\%) of
   the total variance in bee abundance and diversity across sites. This was
   true regardless of the scale of analysis at which the landscape factors
   were measured. Instead, a yard's floral richness, and, to a somewhat
   lesser extent, its floral abundance, emerged as the most important
   predictors of a yard's bee community abundance and diversity. Our study
   offers an important counterpoint to a growing body of work emphasizing
   the impacts of landscape factors on bee communities. Instead, our
   research suggests that improving bee floral resources by increasing the
   plant species richness and abundance locally is a powerful tool to
   support bee conservation, regardless of the level of urbanization or
   tree cover in the surrounding landscape. Our work highlights that the
   practice of promoting `bee-friendly' plantings in private yards,
   currently being undertaken by a number of non-profits around the world,
   can play an important role in restoring and maintaining urban pollinator
   communities. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH on

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {830-840},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {1. Concomitant with the rise in the proportion of the global human
   population that resides in urban areas has been growth in awareness of
   the importance of the provision of ecosystem goods and services to those
   people. Urban areas are themselves of significance in this regard
   because of their areal extent, and hence the quantity of services
   falling within their bounds, and because of the need for local provision
   of services to urban residents. 2. Here, we review key challenges to the
   effective management of ecosystem goods and services within urban areas.
   3. These challenges include the structure of green space, its temporal
   dynamics, spatial constraint on ecosystem service flows, occurrence of
   novel forms of flows, large numbers of land managers, conflicting
   management goals, possible differences between perceptions of urban
   dwellers and the reality of the distribution and flow of ecosystem
   services, and the wicked' nature of the problem of ecosystem service
   management. 4. Synthesis and applications. Urban areas present very
   particular combinations of challenges and opportunities for the
   management of ecosystem goods and services. The spatial and temporal
   heterogeneity of green spaces greatly complicates the maintenance and
   improvement in service provision as well as dramatically inflating
   costs. Spatial constraints on ecosystem service flows mean that these
   can be highly dependent on the maintenance of particular areas of
   connectivity, but also that provision of additional key points of
   connectivity may be disproportionately beneficial to those flows. The
   existence of novel forms of flows of ecosystem services in urban areas
   offers means of overcoming spatial constraints on more natural flows,
   but will require the development of new kinds of ecosystem process
   models to inform their design and management. The large numbers of land
   managers, conflicts between the best approaches for managing for
   different goods and services, and frequent differences between the
   perceptions of urban dwellers and the reality of urban landscapes create
   a complex management context. The management of ecosystem goods and
   services is closely allied to the challenges of conventional urban
   planning. However, applied ecology has a broad range of tools available
   to assist in determining solutions, including the use of high-resolution
   remote sensing techniques, landscape ecology principles and theory (e.g.
   patch and matrix frameworks, meta-population models), and systematic
   conservation planning approaches.},

Journal = {RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {40},
Month = {JAN 30},
Abstract = {The EAT-Lancet Commission recommends increasing the consumption of nut
   trees worldwide as part of a sustainable diet. Integrating more nut tree
   species in urban gardening initiatives could provide members access to
   locally grown nuts and provide ecosystem services to urban landscapes.
   This study investigated the reported presence and diversity of nut tree
   species in urban community gardens, as well as the motivations and
   challenges for adopting and expanding those trees. Based on an online
   survey with 111 responding projects from the urban community gardening
   network in Germany as our case study, we found that nut tree species
   exist in almost half of all responding projects surveyed, albeit in a
   few numbers of individual trees and producing low yields. Projects are
   motivated by the provisioning, regulating, and cultural ecosystem
   services they provide, such as the nutritional value of nuts, the
   provision of food for animals, and the potential for education of
   members about agroforestry and nut use. Yet projects are hindered by
   limited space, local laws and regulations, and the interaction of nut
   trees with other species in the garden. Although only 50\% of projects
   plan to incorporate more nut tree species in the future, most recognize
   the importance of nuts as part of a healthy diet. Governmental
   leadership is necessary to secure long-term contracts for urban gardens,
   so that more nut trees can be planted, and city residents can exploit
   the benefits of the ecosystem services they provide.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {703-709},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Today's worldwide expansion of dry land cities consumes cultivated and
   native ecosystems, providing laboratories for investigating imprints of
   former land use in places where people now live. Around Phoenix, USA, we
   compared soil nutrient pools in residential yards converted from farms
   with nutrient pools in yards developed on native desert. Organic matter,
   carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and soluble ions were > 2-fold greater in
   yards that were previously agrarian than in yards that were not. These
   pools remain elevated 40 years after land conversion to residential use.
   Present N accumulation (1.5 g m(-2) yr(-1)) is not affected by prior
   land use, suggesting that rates of residential fertilizer application
   and retention are not affected by antecedent soil fertility.
   Bioavailable, inorganic phosphorus (P-av) is elevated in soil with a
   recent agrarian past, but this signal disappears after 10-30 years of
   residential use owing to an accumulation of P-av in never-farmed yards.
   Our results indicate a `direct agrarian legacy,' wherein agrarian
   amendment of nutrient pools endures urbanization, more so than an
   `indirect legacy,' wherein present land management is molded by former
   land use. Agriculture in dry lands thus sequesters material in soils,
   and-as we also found higher material contents in residential soils than
   in contemporary agrarian soils-residential land use simply adds to the
   agrarian legacy these soils already bear. Intense human use of arid
   lands may cause increases in material pools in soils, a condition with
   potential global consequence.},

Title = {Factors influencing the annual risk of bird-window collisions at
   residential structures in Alberta, Canada},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Number = {7},
Pages = {583-592},
Abstract = {Context. Increasingly, ornithologists are being asked to identify major
   sources of avian mortality so as to identify conservation priorities.
   Aims. Considerable evidence suggests that windows of office towers are a
   lethal hazard for migrating birds. The factors influencing the risk of
   bird-window collisions in residential settings are not understood as
   well.
   Methods. Citizen scientists were requested to participate in an online
   survey that asked about characteristics concerning their homes and
   yards, general demographic information about participants, and whether
   they had observed evidence of bird-window collisions at their home.
   Key results. We found that 39.0\% of 1458 participants observed a
   bird-window collision in the previous year. The mean number of reported
   collisions was 1.7 +/- 4.6 per residence per year, with 38\% of
   collisions resulting in a mortality.
   Conclusions. Collisions were not random, with the highest collision and
   mortality rates at rural residences, with bird feeders > rural
   residences without feeders > urban residences with feeders > urban
   residences without feeders > apartments. At urban houses, the age of
   neighbourhood was a significant predictor of collision rates, with newer
   neighbourhoods reporting fewer collisions than older neighbourhoods.
   Most people remembered collisions occurring in the summer months.
   Implications. Our results are consistent with past research, suggesting
   that window collisions with residential homes are an important source of
   mortality for birds. However, we found large variation in the frequency
   of collisions at different types of residences. Proper stratification of
   residence type is crucial to getting accurate estimates of bird-window
   collisions when scaling local data into larger-scale mortality
   estimates.},

Title = {Exploring Floridians' perceptions of pollinator-friendly gardening to
   identify critical adoption barriers and strategies},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Developed landscapes in urban and peri-urban environments significantly
   influence the diversity, abundance, and overall health of pollinator
   populations such as bees, butterflies, moths, and birds. Considering
   growing evidence demonstrating that pollinator health can be more robust
   in urban habitats than rural ones, the landscape development and
   management practices adopted in urban and suburban areas have a
   significant potential impact on pollinator health. Given their influence
   with respect to urban and suburban landscape management in Florida, it
   is critical to better understand the knowledge, attitudes, and
   perceptions of Florida residents regarding pollinator-friendly gardening
   practices such as the flowering plant installation or reduced pesticide
   application. To explore the most salient factors influencing residents'
   adoption of pollinator gardening practices, we facilitated three
   elicitation focus groups with 20 residents representing three distinct
   regions in Florida. Data analysis generated a series of salient
   sub-themes across two thematic categories: `barriers' and `solutions and
   strategies'. Major `barrier' themes included `limited knowledge or
   information access' about pollinator gardening, and `social
   norms/community expectations'. Major solution and strategy' themes
   included `developing neighborhood/homeowner association buy-in,' and
   `pre-installation research and planning'. Overall, findings demonstrate
   that Florida residents have strong views regarding both the most
   influential barriers to adopting or engaging in pollinator-friendly
   gardening and the most promising solutions or strategies to mitigate
   those barriers. These findings have tangible implications for
   educational practitioners interested in expanding distribution of
   targeted educational outreach to further promote the adoption of
   pollinator-friendly landscape management practices in Florida. Findings
   also have implications for researchers interested in further examining
   the socio-economic and socio-cultural factors most influential to
   residents' pollinator gardening practices.},

Abstract = {Urban gardens are important sources of sustenance for communities with
   limited access to food. Hence, this study focuses on food production in
   gardens in the Toledo metropolitan area in Northwest Ohio. We
   administered surveys to 150 garden managers from November 2014 to
   February 2015 in our attempt to better understand how neighbourhood
   racial composition and poverty levels are related to staffing and
   voluntarism, food production and distribution, the development of
   infrastructure, and the adoption of sustainability practices in urban
   gardens. The results from 30 gardens are presented in this paper. We
   used Geographic Information Systems to map the gardens and overlay the
   map with 2010 census data so that we could conduct demographic analyses
   of the neighbourhoods in which the gardens were located. Though the
   gardens were small - two acres or less - up to 46 varieties of food were
   grown in a single garden. Gardens also operated on small budgets. Food
   from the gardens was gifted or shared with friends, family, and
   neighbourhood residents. Gardens in predominantly minority
   neighbourhoods tended to have fewer institutional partners, less garden
   infrastructure, and had adopted fewer sustainable practices than gardens
   in predominantly White neighbourhoods. Nonetheless, residents of
   predominantly minority and high-poverty neighbourhoods participated in
   garden activities and influenced garden operations. Volunteering and
   staffing were racialised and gendered.},

Title = {The conservation value of urban green space habitats for Australian
   native bee communities},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {187},
Pages = {240-248},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Networks of urban green space can provide critical resources for wild
   bees, however it is unclear which attributes of green spaces provide
   these resources, or how their management can be improved to benefit a
   diversity of bee species. We examined bee communities in three dominant
   urban green space habitats: (1) golf courses (2) public parks and (3)
   front gardens and streetscapes in residential neighbourhoods in
   Melbourne, Australia and assessed which local and landscape attributes
   influenced bee communities. There was a greater abundance and richness
   of bee species in public parks compared to golf courses and residential
   neighbourhoods, where the latter habitat was dominated by European
   Honeybees (Apis mellifera). The occurrence of A. mellifera was
   positively associated with increases in flowering and native plants.
   Ground-nesting Homalictus species occurred more frequently in older golf
   courses and public parks surrounded by low impervious surface cover, and
   with a low diversity of flowering plants. Cavity nesting, floral
   specialists within the Colletidae family occurred more often in green
   space habitats with greater native vegetation, and occurred infrequently
   in residential neighbourhoods. The lack of appropriate nesting habitat
   and dominance of exotic flowering plants in residential neighbourhoods
   appeared to positively impact upon the generalist A. mellifera, but
   negatively affected cavity and ground nesting floral specialist bee
   species (e.g. Halictidae and Colletidae). Our results highlight the need
   to include urban areas in pollinator conservation initiatives, as
   providing resources critical to diverse bee communities can assist in
   maintaining these key pollinators in urban landscapes. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Opening the black box of bird-window collisions: passive video
   recordings in a residential backyard},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Collisions with windows on buildings are a major source of bird
   mortality. The current understanding of daytime collisions is limited by
   a lack of empirical data on how collisions occur in the real world
   because most data are collected by recording evidence of mortality
   rather than pre-collision behaviour. Based on published literature
   suggesting a causal relationship between bird collision risk and the
   appearance of reflections on glass, the fact that reflections vary in
   appearance depending on viewing angle, and general principles of object
   collision kinematics, we hypothesized that the risk and lethality of
   window collisions may be related to the angle and velocity of birds'
   flight. We deployed a home security camera system to passively record
   interactions between common North American bird species and residential
   windows in a backyard setting over spring, summer and fall seasons over
   2 years. We captured 38 events including 29 collisions and nine
   near-misses in which birds approached the glass but avoided impact. Only
   two of the collisions resulted in immediate fatality, while 23 birds
   flew away immediately following impact. Birds approached the glass at
   variable flight speeds and from a wide range of angles, suggesting that
   the dynamic appearance of reflections on glass at different times of day
   may play a causal role in collision risk. Birds that approached the
   window at higher velocity were more likely to be immediately killed or
   stunned. Most collisions were not detected by the building occupants
   and, given that most birds flew away immediately, carcass surveys would
   only document a small fraction of window collisions. We discuss the
   implications of characterizing pre-collision behaviour for designing
   effective collision prevention methods.},

Title = {Urban food cultivation in the United Kingdom: Quantifying loss of
   allotment land and identifying potential for restoration},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {199},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Urban agriculture contributes to food security and human wellbeing and
   is associated with a wide range of environmental benefits. In the United
   Kingdom, a substantial proportion of urban agriculture occurs in
   allotment gardens, and these are a historically significant part of the
   landscape. However, allotment land provision has declined significantly
   since its mid-twentieth century peak. Here, we examine the magnitude and
   nature of this decline using a GIS analysis of historic Ordnance Survey
   maps covering ten British urban areas from the beginning of the
   twentieth century to the present. We find there has been a 65\% decline
   in allotment land from its peak to 2016, a pattern also reflected in per
   capita provision, which declined by 62\%, demonstrating a long-term
   trend across the case study areas, and the loss of food provisioning
   land for an average of 6\% of the urban population. We also show that
   the most at-risk areas for food insecurity have faced eight times the
   level of allotment closures than the least deprived areas. Assessing
   subsequent land-use of former allotments, we show that 47\% of allotment
   land is now part of the urban built infrastructure, and 25\% is other
   forms of urban greenspace. Restoration of these greenspace sites to
   allotments has the potential to meet up to 100\% of the current levels
   of demand for new allotments by residents of our case study areas. Our
   results demonstrate that whilst a significant amount of urban
   agricultural land has been lost, opportunities for restoration exist on
   a substantial scale.},

Title = {Tree abundance, diversity and their driving and indicative factors in
   Beijing?s residential areas},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {125},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Urban trees provide a range of ecological services for urban dwellers.
   This is particularly true in residential areas where these services are
   known and valued. The abundance and diversity of trees determine and
   indicate the provision of ecological services by trees, while various
   characteristics of residential areas determine and indicate the
   abundance and diversity of trees within those areas. Exploring the
   abundance and diversity of trees in residential areas and their major
   driving and indicative factors is important for evaluating, predicting,
   and thus improving the ecological services provided by trees. Here, we
   selected 87 residential areas in Beijing through spatially stratified
   random sampling. Unlike the quadrat survey that is usually used, we
   conducted a detailed investigation of the abundance and diversity of
   trees in residential areas through a tree-by-tree survey and explored
   the major driving and indicative factors of the abundance and diversity
   of the trees. In the 87 sampled residential areas, 69 tree taxa
   belonging to 34 families were identified, and we found that the 10 most
   common species accounted for 55.9\% of all trees. Trees in the
   residential areas had both high allergenic risk and high ornamental
   value. In newly built residential areas, the allergenic risk decreased
   but the ornamental value remained high. Average building height and
   distance to the city center were the two major driving and indicative
   factors of residential tree abundance, both of which were positive
   indicators, and the former played a larger role than that of the latter.
   In this study, distance to the city center was the only predicator of
   tree species diversity, and was also a positive indicator. The size of
   residential area did not show any relationship with tree abundance or
   diversity. Even though housing age and housing price were not included
   in the forecasting model, both showed a negative correlation with tree
   abundance, i.e., an opposite legacy effect and luxury effect. The
   results of this study can help in understanding tree abundance and
   diversity and their driving and indicative factors in residential areas
   in highly urbanized cities and can provide potential guidance for future
   residential tree planning and management.},

Title = {Residential green space and mental health-related prescription
   medication sales: An ecological study in Belgium},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {211},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Residential green space has been associated with mental
   health benefits, but how such associations vary with green space types
   is insufficiently known. Objective: We aimed to investigate associations
   between types and quantities of green space and sales of mood disorder
   medication in Belgium.Methods: We used aggregated sales data of
   psycholeptics and psychoanaleptics prescribed to adults from 2006 to
   2014. Generalized mixed effects models were used to investigate
   associations between relative covers of woodland, low-green, grassland,
   and garden, and average annual medication sales. Models were adjusted
   for socio-economic background variables, urban-rural differences, and
   administrative region, and included random effects of latitude and
   longitude. Results: Urban census tracts were associated with 9-10\%
   higher medication sales. In nationwide models, a 10\% increase in
   relative cover of woodland, garden, and grass was associated with a
   1-2\% decrease in medication sales. The same association was found for
   low green but only for men. In stratified models, a 10\% increase in
   relative cover of any green space type in urban census tracts was
   associated with a decrease of medication sales by 1-3\%. In rural census
   tracts, no protective associations between green space and mood disorder
   medication sales were observed, with the exception of relative woodland
   cover for women (-1\%), and low green was associated with higher
   medication sales (+6-7\%). Conclusions: Taken together, these results
   suggest that living in green environments may be beneficial for adult
   mental health. Woodland exposure seemed the most beneficial, but the
   amount of green space was more important than the type. Results
   underline the importance of conserving green space in our living
   environment, for the conservation of biodiversity and for human health.},

Abstract = {In arid and semiarid regions, where few if any trees are native, city
   trees are largely human planted. Societal factors such as resident
   preferences for tree traits, nursery offerings, and neighborhood
   characteristics are potentially key drivers of urban tree community
   composition and diversity, however, they remain critically understudied.
   We investigated patterns of urban tree structure in residential
   neighborhoods of the Salt Lake Valley, Utah, combining biological
   variables, such as neighborhood and plant nursery tree species and trait
   composition, and sociological data comprised of resident surveys and
   U.S. Census data. We sampled nine neighborhoods that varied in household
   income and age of homes. We found more tree species were offered in
   locally owned nurseries compared with mass merchandiser stores and yard
   trees at private residences were more diverse than public street trees
   in the same neighborhoods. There were significant differences among
   neighborhoods in street and yard tree composition. Newer neighborhoods
   differed from older neighborhoods in street tree species composition and
   trait diversity, while neighborhoods varying in affluence differed in
   yard tree composition. Species richness of yard trees was positively
   correlated with neighborhood household income, while species richness of
   street trees was negatively correlated with home age of neighborhood
   residences. Tree traits differed across neighborhoods of varying ages,
   suggesting different tree availability and preferences over time. Last,
   there was a positive correlation between resident preferences for tree
   attributes and the number of trees that had those attributes both in
   residential yards and in nursery offerings. Strong relationships between
   social variables and urban tree composition provides evidence that
   resident preferences and nursery offerings affect patterns of
   biodiversity in cities across Salt Lake Valley. These findings can be
   applied toward efforts to increase taxonomic and functional diversity of
   city trees in semiarid regions in ways that will also provide ecosystem
   services of most interest to residents.},

Abstract = {About 52\% of the world's population now lives in urban areas, and 41\%
   of urban land in developed countries is used for residential areas. The
   amount and quality of residential green space, an important element in
   urban residential infrastructure, is closely correlated to city
   dwellers' quality of life. The quality of green spaces is not only
   closely correlated to the ecosystem services they provide, but also to
   their disservices. In order to (i) examine how plant diversity and plant
   traits vary in different residential areas, (ii) determine the main
   socio-economic factors driving plant trait variations across different
   residential areas, and (iii) provide an overview on selected ecosystem
   services and disservices related to plant diversity, we investigated the
   flora and socio-economic properties of 83 residential areas in Beijing,
   China. We found a total of 369 plant species belonging to 99 families
   and 150 genera. With respect to plant traits, there were 90 annual
   species, 174 alien species, 169 pollen allergenic species, and 133
   species with edible or pharmaceutical value. The number of perennial,
   alien, ornamental and edible plant species was largest in residential
   areas completed in the 1990s. The number of allergenic species was
   highest in residential areas completed prior to 1980. The Simpson,
   Shannon and Pielou indices for trees and shrubs were highest in areas
   completed in the 1990s, while those same indices for herbs were highest
   in residential areas completed prior to 1980. General Linear Model
   analyses revealed that richness increased with increasing housing price
   across all groups of species. Principal Component Analysis indicated
   that housing price and floor-area ratio are the variables that
   positively correlate with species richness for all groups of species.

Abstract = {This paper analyzes land-system dynamics changes due to energy
   infrastructure development and explores the environmental and social
   ramifications of hydraulic fracturing, through a case study in Central
   Appalachia. Grounded in photographic data, satellite images, and
   ethnographic material, this study demonstrates landscape and embodied
   experiences of change over time. Data show major shifts in terms of
   wildlife behavior, possibilities for farming and gardening, and
   byproducts of construction like noise, pollution, and excavation.
   However, what we argue is crucial to examine is the emotional toll that
   these changes have taken on rural residents. Interviewees chose to live
   in West Virginia because of deep enchantment with the surrounding
   natural beauty, which they feel they have lost due to energy
   development. While energy research has been dominated by technical
   disciplines and explanations, we advocate for an emotional-oriented
   analysis that accounts for individually lived experiences in the context
   of these landscape-level changes.},

Title = {Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices Survey in Greece before the
   Implementation of Sterile Insect Technique against Aedes
   albopictus},
Journal = {INSECTS},

Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Aedes albopictus, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, tends to breed
   in various artificial containers frequently found in urban areas. Since
   urban areas cannot be easily accessed for the application of control
   measures, community engagement is considered beneficial in vector
   control. The area of Vravrona, Greece was selected for the
   implementation of the sterile insect technique (SIT) against Aedes
   albopictus for the first time in Greece. In the current study, a
   door-to-door campaign was used as a prerelease intervention to raise
   community awareness about SIT and encourage removal of mosquito habitats
   in their yards. A KAP (knowledge, attitude, practices) survey was used
   to collect these data of local community members. Our results
   demonstrate that using the door-to-door campaign as a prerelease method
   can raise community awareness, reduce the initial mosquito population,
   and potentially improve SIT efficacy. The participation of key persons,
   such as scientific experts and municipality members, in the
   implementation of the interventions is crucial for the successful
   engagement of community and may prove important in granting permission
   to enter their private properties for entomological surveillance.
   Community involvement in Aedes albopictus management can be very
   efficient and result in raising awareness among citizens. Toward this
   end, a door-to-door campaign can encourage active community
   participation in vector control. The current study describes the results
   of an intervention where a KAP (knowledge, attitude, practices) survey
   tool was paired with a door-to-door campaign and was implemented as an
   intervention method in Vravrona area (Attica, Greece) before the release
   of sterile males (sterile insect technique, SIT) against Aedes
   albopictus. The KAP tool was used to shed light on the knowledge,
   practices, and attitudes of local community members in order to better
   prepare and motivate participation in household mosquito control and to
   assess current understanding of SIT. Each household also received
   specific information about mosquito source habitat in their own yards at
   the time of the initial KAP survey. These household data were
   complemented by standardized mosquito trapping in the municipality. Our
   findings indicate that citizens' attitude toward SIT ranged from
   indecisive to fully supportive, while 77.5\% of the respondents agreed
   that the SIT has many advantages over chemical control methods.
   Furthermore, the results demonstrate that using the door-to-door
   campaign as an intervention and prerelease method before SIT can
   suppress the initial mosquito population and potentially improve its
   efficacy. Lastly, we show that the presence of local municipality
   officials during door-to-door visits was associated with increased
   willingness from the residents to participate in the intervention.},

Title = {Effects of urban land use on pollinator (Hymenoptera: Apoidea)
   communities in a desert metropolis},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {209-218},
Abstract = {We compared the species richness and abundance of pollinator
   (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) communities in two seasons (September 1998 and
   April 1999) among four types of urban land use in the Phoenix, Arizona,
   USA, metropolitan area (xeriscaped residential yards, mesiscaped
   residential yards, urban desert-remnant parks, and natural desert parks
   on the fringe of the metropolitan area). Richness and abundance of bees
   were generally lower in residential areas than in desert areas, with
   desert areas on the fringe of the metro area possessing the highest
   diversity of all sites. Residential yards that utilized xeric
   landscaping had a more diverse bee community (with proportionally more
   rare species) than did mesic (turf grass) yards, particularly in late
   summer (September). Although bee community structure was apparently
   unaffected by the density of local habitat features (native and exotic
   trees, shrubs, cacti, and herbaceous plants in addition to human-built
   structures), the types of habitat features do appear to influence the
   number and types of bees present in an area. These results suggest that
   urban development can be designed to promote the conservation of bees.
   Specifically, preservation of desert and greater use of xeric
   landscaping rather than mesiscaping may help preserve this ecologically
   and economically vital group of organisms.},

Title = {Ethnomedicinal survey of a maroon community in Brazil's Atlantic
   tropical forest},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {181},
Pages = {37-49},
Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Considerable medicinal plant research in
   Brazil has focused on indigenous and mixed-race (caboclo and caicara)
   communities, but relatively few studies have examined the medicinal
   plants and associated healing traditions of the descendants of enslaved
   Africans. This study surveyed the medicinal plants employed by a
   relatively isolated maroon community of Afro-Brazilians in the Atlantic
   coastal rainforests of Bahia, Brazil, a global biodiversity hotspot. The
   studied community is exceptional in that the residents were defacto
   slaves until several years ago, with no access to western medicine. We
   examined the following questions: 1) What medicinal plants are used in
   this community? 2) What are the principal taxonomic groups, life forms,
   source habitats, and geographical origins? 3) What species stand out as
   measured by use value and frequency indices? and 4) Is the community's
   geographical isolation and African ancestry reflected in their medicinal
   uses of the local flora?
   Materials and methods: The study was carried out in the Quilombo
   Salamina Putumuju maroon community in Bahia, Brazil. Data were collected
   from May to October 2014 from 74 individuals (37 men and 37 women) by
   means of semi-structured interviews, walk in the woods, and vouchering
   of identified species. We used the Cultural Value Index (CV), the
   Relative Frequency Index (RF), and the Use Value Index (UV) to determine
   the importance of medicinal plant resources. Continuity of African
   medicinal plant uses and traditions was determined through
   self-reporting and comparison with previously published works.
   Results: We recorded 118 medicinal plant species distributed in 100
   genera and 51 families. The best represented families were: Asteraceae,
   Fabaceae, Lamiaceae and Myrtaceae. Most plant medicines were used to
   treat respiratory, digestive systems, genitourinary, and skin problems.
   The most common medicinal life form was herbs (44\%), followed by trees
   (28\%) and shrubs (18\%). Native species (55\%) were used somewhat more
   than exotic species (45\%), and non-cultivated species (51\%) were
   slightly more numerous than cultivated species (49\%). In spite of
   abundant nearby old-growth forests, trails and gardens were the most
   common collection sites. A mean of 13.2 medicinal plant species were
   cited per participant. The highest CV was recorded for Cymbopogon
   citratus (0.20) followed by Lippia alba (0.19) and Stryphnodendron cf.
   adstringens (0.17). The highest RF included C. citratus (0.69), L. alba
   (0.59), and Eugenia uniflora (0.55). The highest UV figures were
   recorded for S. cf. adstringens (1.68), followed by Sida cf. cordifolia
   (0.97) and C citratus (0.93).Fifteen species (13\%) of this maroon
   medicinal flora trace their ancestry to Africa or African-derived
   healing traditions.
   Conclusion: The Salamina maroon community maintains considerable
   knowledge of the medicinal value of the local flora. However, little of
   this knowledge is derived from the surrounding old-growth tropical
   forests. Their pharmacopoeia is a hybrid mix of wild and cultivated
   species, natives and exotics. Among those species representing the
   community's isolation and African ancestry, most are associated with
   spiritual and magical medicine. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {More than half of the world's population inhabit urban areas, causing
   significant environmental changes. In underdeveloped countries this fact
   is expressed in a chaotic manner, generating social and structural
   problems. The city of Rio de Janeiro is a megalopolis known worldwide
   for its natural beauties, including beaches and forests and because of
   favelas (subnormal clusters of houses of economically poor people).The
   favelas are composed of a mosaic of cultures which reflects even in
   urban afforestation. In this work we characterize the afforestation
   structure of a favela to understand its ecological and social
   functionalities. The survey was conducted in the favela Morro da
   Formiga, with an area of approximately 30 ha. It was conducted through a
   census and using the list of species, a classification based on 11
   parameters was carried out. 1,042 individuals were found, belonging to
   110 genera, 148 species and 42 families. The most abundant species shows
   that the planters intend is, leastwise partially, generating an
   extra-support for community in terms of feeding fruits (62\% of the
   subjects had this purpose). In relation to the nature thereof, the
   natives species represents 54\% of the total, while the exotic species
   39\%. About 50\% of the trees are in the backyards of houses and a few
   in squares and streets. It was found that 70\% of individuals were
   planted by residents. Studies are needed to identify which native
   species can replace community demands currently supplied by exotic
   species that have been used for decades. The ``forestation{''} in
   favelas is quite distinct from that implemented by the city hall in more
   urbanized areas. In favelas, the species reflect more about the
   knowledge of the local population, their backgrounds and needs.},

Title = {The rarity of direct experiences of nature in an urban population},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {160},
Pages = {79-84},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As people live more urbanised lifestyles there is potential to lose
   daily contact with nature, diminishing access to the wide range of
   associated health benefits of interacting with nature. Experiences of
   nature vary widely across populations, but this variation is poorly
   understood. We surveyed 1023 residents of an urban population in the UK
   to measure four distinctly different nature interactions: indirect
   (viewing nature through a window at work and at home), incidental
   (spending time outside at work), intentional. (time spent in private
   gardens) and intentional (time spent in public parks). Scaled-up to the
   whole study population, accumulation curves of the total number of hours
   per week that people were exposed to each type of nature interaction
   showed that 75\% of nature interactions were experienced by half the
   population. Moreover, 75\% of the interactions of a type where people
   were actually present in nature were experienced by just 32\% of the
   population. The average hours each individual experienced nature per
   week varied across interactions: indirect (46.0 +/- 27.3 SD), incidental
   (6.4 +/- 12.7 SD), intentional gardens (2.5 +/- 2.9 SD) and
   intentional-parks (2.3 +/- 2.7 SD). Experiencing nature regularly
   appears to be the exception rather than the norm, with a person's
   connection to nature being positively associated with incidental and
   intentional experiences. This novel study provides baseline information
   regarding how an urban population experiences different types of nature.
   Deconstructing nature experience will pave the way for developing
   recommendations for targeted health outcomes. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Title = {Public land managers and sustainable urban vegetation: The case of
   low-input turfgrasses},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {284-292},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In urban ecosystems, public land managers are responsible for making
   complex decisions about vegetation and the management of public spaces
   that have ecological, economic, and social consequences. Across the
   globe, the question is whether to move from commonly used vegetation
   options that require multiple inputs (e.g. water, fertilizer,
   pesticides) and intensive management (e.g. mowing, re-seeding) to more
   sustainable, low-input, low-management vegetation varieties. Little is
   known about urban public land managers' perceptions and beliefs about
   low-input turfgrass (e.g. fine fescue species) and their willingness to
   encourage such environmentally sustainable practices for public lands or
   support low-input vegetation conversion programs for private residential
   yards in their cities. We surveyed U.S. public land managers in
   Minnesota and New Jersey metropolitan areas about their preferences and
   beliefs regarding low-input turfgrass, specifically cool season fine
   fescue, and related those beliefs to opportunities for urban
   environmental sustainability. Overall managers showed favorable views
   towards low-input turfgrasses suggesting an interest in conversion to
   more sustainable management. Also, they demonstrated significant support
   of municipal programs to convert both public and private lands to
   low-input turfgrasses. Educational attainment and employer type were
   found to be responsible for most differing viewpoints among managers.
   This study suggests public land managers may not be a barrier to
   sustainable vegetation change, but rather important facilitators. More
   work needs to be done to understand this phenomenon globally and
   evaluate public land managers' roles in the transition to low-input
   vegetation as well as capacity to anticipate future challenges for
   vegetation in the urban ecosystem, more broadly.},

Title = {Vegetation communities on commercial developments are heterogenous and
   determined by development and landscaping decisions, not socioeconomics},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {In urban ecosystems, woody vegetation communities and the ecosystem
   functions and habitat they provide are largely controlled by humans.
   These communities are assembled during development, landscaping, and
   maintenance processes according to decisions made by human actors. While
   vegetation communities on residential land uses are increasingly well
   studied, these efforts generally have not extended to other land uses,
   including commercial property. To fill this gap, I surveyed tree and
   shrub communities on office developments located in Redmond and
   Bellevue, Washington, USA, and explored whether aggregated neighborhood
   and parcel scale socio-economic variables or variables describing the
   outcome of development and landscaping actions better explained
   variation in vegetation communities. I found that both tree and shrub
   communities on office developments are heterogenous, with sites
   characterized by native or ornamental vegetation. The heterogeneity I
   observed in vegetation communities within one land use suggests that
   different ecosystem functions, habitat quality, and habitat quantities
   are provided on office developments. Greater provision of e.g. native
   conifer habitat is possible using currently existing developments as
   models. Additionally, the outcome of development and landscaping
   decisions explained more variation in community composition than the
   socio-economic factors found significant on residential property.
   Together with previous research showing that residential property owner
   attitudes and actions are more important than socio-economic
   descriptors, my results suggest that individual motivators, including
   intended audience, may be the primary determinant of urban vegetation
   communities. Future urban ecology research should consider sampling the
   vegetation gradient within land uses, better understanding individual
   motivation for vegetation management, and creating models of the urban
   ecosystems that account for alternate decision pathways on different
   land uses.},

Title = {Impact of monkey-human relationships and habitat change on
   Semnopithecus vetulus nestor in human modified habitats},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SRI LANKA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Semnopithecus (Trachypithecus) vetulus nestor; (Family: Cercopithecidae,
   Sub-family Colobinae) the western purple-faced langur of Sri Lanka, is
   currently recognized as one of the world's 25 most endangered primate
   taxa. This paper seeks to identify and assess the impact of monkey-human
   relationships on S. vetulus nestor, in areas where monkeys and humans
   co-occur, and to ascertain threats to these langur populations living
   outside natural forests.
   Monkey-human conflicts were investigated in 1985 during a census of
   langurs at seven sites in and around Panadura and Piliyandala. More
   detailed data were gathered through direct observation of two habituated
   free ranging groups of S. vetulus nestor in home gardens and rubber
   monocultures at two study sites in Panadura and Piliyandala during a
   systematic study from 1985-1987. This was followed by opportunistic
   observations during 1987 - 1992 at the Panadura site. A questionnaire
   was administered to householders at these two sites in 1987, and habitat
   change was monitored periodically thereafter until 2006 at both sites.
   The study revealed that loss of canopy cover due to habitat destruction
   was the most significant threat to S. vetulus nestor in human modified
   environments, followed by hunting, which varied in intensity at
   different sites. Live capture of monkeys as pets was not a threat at any
   of the investigated sites. Langurs caused damage to crops and tiled
   roofs, and were considered pests by 47.5\% and 82.4\% of householders at
   the two main study sites. Despite this, there was high tolerance towards
   langurs by householders at both study sites during the 1987 survey; less
   than 10\% of the householders wanted monkeys destroyed; and fewer were
   willing to do so themselves. Most people at each site (63.1\% and 55.6\%
   at Panadura and Piliyandala respectively) harassed or chased monkeys
   only if they caused crop or roof damage. At both sites, food
   competition-mainly for human edible fruit-was the main cause of
   conflict, followed by roof damage.
   The study sites exemplify scenarios in non-forested areas in the densely
   populated geographic range of S. vetulus nestor. This study, therefore,
   underscores the precarious existence of this Critically Endangered
   langur in human-modified habitats, which are vulnerable to change.
   Ensuring the survival of S. vetulus nestor requires addressing the major
   challenges of establishing linkages between isolated forest fragments in
   its range and maintaining adequate canopy cover and food trees in the
   main forest and modified habitats without further delay.},

   identified through the Pediatric Oncology Group and the Children's
   Cancer Group. One age-matched control was identified for each case by
   random digit dialing. Telephone interviews with each parent collected
   information on residential exposure to pesticides, Pesticide use in both

Abstract = {Domestic gardens are the major contributor to greening the spatial plan
   in some compact cities. Irbid, Jordan is a densely populated city that
   has limited and deteriorating natural vegetation and is located in an
   arid to semi-arid climate. We investigated the density of domestic
   gardens (proportion of gardened residential units) in Irbid city and
   explored some properties of domestic gardens. The research focused on
   the city domestic garden types, their distribution, gardens proportions
   and association to household economic status and parcel area. Four
   hundred and thirty residential units were selected randomly using
   Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The sample size for each
   district was identified proportionally relative to the district's total
   residential units. Parcel area, district population, household income
   and landscape properties information were obtained from GIS maps,
   homeowners' interviews or on site observations. Sixty-two percent of the
   city residential units had gardens and those gardens were distributed
   unequally (21-100\%) among city districts. Rural areas had higher garden
   densities (proportions) compared to that at the city center. Around 50\%
   of the city gardens were utilitarian and were concentrated in the rural
   areas, while the aesthetically designed gardens represented 21\% of the
   total gardens and were significantly concentrated near the core urban
   area of the city. Around 53\% of the city domestic gardens were
   categorized as side yards. The districts' domestic garden proportions
   and parcel sizes were positively correlated. The proportions of
   aesthetic gardens were positively correlated with districts' median
   income while utilitarian garden proportions strongly and inversely
   correlated with districts income. This knowledge about the proportions
   of domestic gardens distribution, trends, garden attributes and other
   factors that interfere with the existence and shape of domestic gardens
   has implications for species composition and can serve as a basis for
   green infrastructure planning, sustainable environmental planning
   strategies, and land use policies.},

Title = {Environmental, health, wellbeing, social and equity effects of urban
   green space interventions: A meta-narrative evidence synthesis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: As populations become increasingly urbanised, the
   preservation of urban green space (UGS) becomes paramount. UGS is not
   just dedicated recreational space such as public parks, but other types
   of informal green space are important, for example, street trees and
   roof gardens. Despite the potential from cross-sectional evidence, we
   know little about how to design new, or improve or promote existing UGS
   for health, wellbeing, social and environmental benefits, or known
   influencing factors such as physical activity.
   Objectives: To perform a meta-narrative review of the evidence regarding
   the health, wellbeing, social, environmental and equity effects, or
   known influencing factors of these outcomes, of UGS interventions.
   Data sources: Eight electronic databases were searched ((Medline,
   PsycINFO, Web of Science (Science and Social Science Citation Indices),
   PADDI (Planning Architecture Design Database Ireland), Zetoc, Scopus,
   Greenfiles, SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature in
   Europe)), and reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews
   were hand searched for further relevant studies.
   Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: Eligibility
   criteria included: (i) evaluation of an UGS intervention; and (ii)
   health, wellbeing, social or environmental outcome(s), or known
   influencing factors of these outcomes, measured. Interventions involving
   any age group were included. Interventions must have involved: (a)
   physical change to green space in an urban-context including
   improvements to existing UGS or development of new UGS, or (b)
   combination of physical change to UGS supplemented by a specific UGS
   awareness, marketing or promotion programme to encourage use of UGS.
   Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Following a meta-narrative
   approach, evidence was synthesised by main intervention approach,
   including: (i) park-based; (ii) greenways/trails; (iii) urban greening;
   (iv) large green built projects for environmental purposes. Outcomes
   such as economic (e.g. cost effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses),
   adverse effects and unintended consequences were also extracted.
   Evidence was synthesised following the RAMESES guidelines and
   publication standards, the PROGRESS-plus tool was used to explore equity
   impact, and risk of bias/study quality was assessed. The findings from
   the evidence review were presented at an expert panel representing
   various disciplines in a workshop and these discussions framed the
   findings of the review and provide recommendations that are relevant to
   policy, practice and research.
   Results: Of the 6997 studies identified, 38 were included. There was
   strong evidence to support park-based (7/7 studies) and greenway/trail
   (3/3 studies) interventions employing a dual-approach (i.e. a physical
   change to the UGS and promotion/marketing programmes) particularly for
   park use and physical activity; strong evidence for the greening of
   vacant lots (4/4 studies) for health, wellbeing (e.g. reduction in
   stress) and social (e.g. reduction in crime, increased perceptions of
   safety) outcomes; strong evidence for the provision of urban street
   trees (3/4 studies) and green built interventions for storm water
   management (6/7 studies) for environmental outcomes (e.g. increased
   biodiversity, reduction in illegal dumping). Park-based or
   greenway/trail interventions that did not employ a dual-approach were
   largely ineffective (7/12 studies showed no significant intervention
   effect). Overall, the included studies have inherent biases owing to the
   largely non-randomized study designs employed. There was too little
   evidence to draw firm conclusions regarding the impact of UGS
   interventions on a range of equity indicators.
   Limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings: UGS has an
   important role to play in creating a culture of health and wellbeing.
   Results from this study provide supportive evidence regarding the use of
   certain UGS interventions for health, social and environmental benefits.
   These findings should be interpreted in light of the heterogeneous
   nature of the evidence base, including diverging methods, target
   populations, settings and outcomes. We could draw little conclusions
   regarding the equity impact of UGS interventions. However, the true
   potential of UGS has not been realised as studies have typically
   under-evaluated UGS interventions by not taking account of the
   multifunctional nature of UGS. The findings have implications for
   policymakers, practitioners and researchers. For example, for
   policymakers the trajectory of evidence is generally towards a positive
   association between UGS and health, wellbeing, social and environmental
   outcomes, but any intervention must ensure that negative consequences of
   gentrification and unequal access are minimised.},

Title = {Mapping an urban ecosystem service: quantifying above-ground carbon
   storage at a city-wide scale},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {48},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1125-1134},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {1. Despite urbanization being a major driver of land-use change
   globally, there have been few attempts to quantify and map ecosystem
   service provision at a city-wide scale. One service that is an
   increasingly important feature of climate change mitigation policies,
   and with other potential benefits, is biological carbon storage.
   2. We examine the quantities and spatial patterns of above-ground carbon
   stored in a typical British city, Leicester, by surveying vegetation
   across the entire urban area. We also consider how carbon density
   differs in domestic gardens, indicative of bottom-up management of
   private green spaces by householders, and public land, representing
   top-down landscape policies by local authorities. Finally, we compare a
   national ecosystem service map with the estimated quantity and
   distribution of above-ground carbon within our study city.
   3. An estimated 231 521 tonnes of carbon is stored within the
   above-ground vegetation of Leicester, equating to 3.16 kg C m(-2) of
   urban area, with 97.3\% of this carbon pool being associated with trees
   rather than herbaceous and woody vegetation.
   4. Domestic gardens store just 0.76 kg C m(-2), which is not
   significantly different from herbaceous vegetation landcover (0.14 kg C
   m(-2)). The greatest above-ground carbon density is 28.86 kg C m(-2),
   which is associated with areas of tree cover on publicly owned/managed
   sites.
   5. Current national estimates of this ecosystem service undervalue
   Leicester's contribution by an order of magnitude.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The UK government has recently set a
   target of an 80\% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, from 1990
   levels, by 2050. Local authorities are central to national efforts to
   cut carbon emissions, although the reductions required at city-wide
   scales are yet to be set. This has led to a need for reliable data to
   help establish and underpin realistic carbon emission targets and
   reduction trajectories, along with acceptable and robust policies for
   meeting these goals. Here, we illustrate the potential benefits of
   accounting for, mapping and appropriately managing above-ground
   vegetation carbon stores, even within a typical densely urbanized
   European city.},

   Childhood Leukemia Study},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {121},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home and garden pesticide use has been linked to cancer and
   other health outcomes in numerous epidemiological studies. Exposure has
   generally been self-reported, so the assessment is potentially limited
   by recall bias and lack of information on specific chemicals.
   OBJECTIVES: As part of an integrated assessment of residential pesticide
   exposure, we identified active ingredients and described patterns of
   storage and use.
   METHODS: During a home interview of 500 residentially stable households
   enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study during
   2001-2006, trained interviewers inventoried residential pesticide
   products and queried participants about their storage and use. U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency registration numbers, recorded from
   pesticide product labels, and pesticide chemical codes were matched to
   public databases to obtain information on active ingredients and
   chemical class. Poisson regression was used to identify independent
   predictors of pesticide storage. Analyses were restricted to 259
   participating control households.
   RESULTS: Ninety-five percent (246 of 259) of the control households
   stored at least one pesticide product (median, 4). Indicators of higher
   sociodemographic status predicted more products in storage. We
   identified the most common characteristics: storage areas (garage, 40\%;
   kitchen, 20\%), pests treated (ants, 33\%; weeds, 20\%), pesticide types
   (insecticides, 46\%; herbicides, 24\%), chemical classes (pyrethroids,
   77\%; botanicals, 50\%), active ingredients (pyrethrins, 43\%) and
   synergists (piperonyl butoxide, 42\%). Products could contain multiple
   active ingredients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data on specific active ingredients and patterns of
   storage and use will inform future etiologic analyses of residential
   pesticide exposures from self-reported data, particularly among
   households with young children.},

Abstract = {Domestic gardens are spaces imbued with meaning, expression, and

   factors can influence and change garden identities. This paper addresses
   a gap in existing literature and explores garden identities,
   underscoring the importance of gardens across the lifespan to
   liveability and sense of self. It argues that valuing everyday objects

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INSECT BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-85},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The brown marmorated stink bug, or Halyomorpha halys, is an invasive
   pest in North America and Europe that causes severe agricultural damage
   and nuisance problems for homeowners; and it is originally from China,
   Taiwan, and the Republic of Korea. While the natural enemy community of
   H. halys has been evaluated in several agroecosystems, it has not been
   examined where H. halys overwinters in anthropogenic structures. The
   aims of the current study were to evaluate 1) whether spider webs
   commonly found in the home and yard can successfully ensnare H. halys,
   2) whether entanglement resulted in consumption by spiders inhabiting
   the webs, and 3) how frequently H. halys becomes entangled in webs under
   ambient conditions. To accomplish this, adult H. halys were introduced
   into webs in and near anthropogenic structures in West Virginia and
   Maryland, United States, and the behavior of spiders was observed for
   5-min intervals at 0, 1, 2, and 24 h after introduction. In addition, a
   survey of webs was performed to determine the frequency with which
   spiders naturally capture H. halys inside buildings and in the
   landscape. Overall, the study found seven spider families in
   anthropogenic structures. Adult H. halys that were introduced into the
   webs of Theridiidae, Pholcidae, or Agelenidae had a greater than 50\%
   chance of being ensnared and consumed. Adult H. halys were found
   naturally most often in webs of Theridiidae. Webs with a funnel or cob
   web architecture had the greatest probability of ensnaring H. halys,
   while those with orb structures resulted in the fewest caught. In the
   wild, 13-20\% of spider webs contained dead H. halys. Our results
   suggest that spiders may be an important contributing factor for
   mortality of H. halys at overwintering sites, and spiders in or outside
   homes may help reduce nuisance problems caused by H. halys.},

Title = {CLIMAVORE: Divesting from Fish Farms Towards the Tidal Commons},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL \& ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In Scotland, residents have fought open-net salmon farms and their toll
   on human and nonhuman bodies for decades. This paper recollects seven
   years of work in Skye and Raasay, two islands off the northwest coast of
   the country, developing strategies to divest away from salmon
   aquaculture. Addressing the contemporary wave of underwater clearances
   created by UK's top food export industry, it unpacks the implementation
   of a transition into alternative horizons by embracing the legacies of
   toxicity inherited from salmon extractivist industries. CLIMAVORE, a
   framework developed as a research-led artistic practice by the authors,
   investigates how to eat in the new seasons of the climate crisis. In a
   season of marine dead zones, it facilitates new approaches to
   aquaecology and coastal care that cultivate coastal livelihoods.
   CLIMAVORE began with a new public forum, shaped as a multispecies
   intertidal table, established in Skye in 2017 to envision
   environmentally regenerative and socially reparative forms of food
   production based on metabolic interactions between humans and depleted
   landscapes that benefit a plethora of species. CLIMAVORE's site
   responsive methodology relies on a socially-engaged art practice,
   consisting of fieldwork, interviews, working groups, oral histories,
   performative meals, cooking and building apprenticeships, tidal
   gardening, material testing and public art installations. Ongoing
   collaboration with residents, scientists, and policymakers critically
   explores ways of living not only on but with the coast. This new
   holistic approach to coastal nourishment provides methodologies for
   ecological praxis as well as a platform for researchers and the general
   public to imagine an alternative ecological future: the tidal commons.},

Abstract = {Domestic cats (Felis catus) have caused the extinction of many island
   species and are thought to kill many billions of birds and mammals in
   the continental United States each year. However, the spatial
   distribution and abundance of cats and their risk to our protected areas
   remains unknown. We worked with citizen scientists to survey the mammals
   at 2,117 sites in 32 protected areas and one urban area across 6 states
   in the eastern United States using camera traps. We found that most
   protected areas had high levels of coyote (Canis latrans) activity, but
   few or no domestic cats. The relative abundance of domestic cats in
   residential yards, where coyotes were rare, was 300 times higher than in
   the protected areas. Our spatial models of cat distribution show the
   amount of coyote activity and housing density are the best predictors of
   cat activity, and that coyotes and cats overlap the most in small urban
   forests. Coyotes were nocturnal at all sites, while cats were nocturnal
   in protected areas, but significantly more diurnal in urban sites. We
   suggest that the ecological impact of free-ranging cats in the region is
   concentrated in urban areas or other sites, such as islands, with few
   coyotes. Our study also shows the value of citizen science for
   conducting broadscale mammal surveys using photo-vouchered locations
   that ensure high data quality. (C) 2015 American Society of

Title = {Impervious surface and local abiotic conditions influence arthropod
   communities within urban greenspaces},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {The abundance of arthropods is declining globally, and
   human-modification of natural habitat is a primary driver of these
   declines. Arthropod declines are concerning because arthropods mediate
   critical ecosystem functions, and sustained declines may lead to
   cascading trophic effects. There is growing evidence that properly
   managed urban environments can provide refugium to arthropods, but few
   cities have examined arthropods within urban greenspaces to evaluate
   their management efforts. In this study, we surveyed arthropod
   communities within a medium-sized, growing city. We investigated
   arthropod communities (abundance, richness, diversity, community
   composition) within 16 urban greenspaces across metropolitan Grand
   Rapids, Michigan (USA). We focused our efforts on urban gardens and
   pocket prairies, and measured environmental variables at each site. We
   collected 5,468 individual arthropods that spanned 14 taxonomic orders
   and 66 morphospecies. The results showed that community composition was
   influenced by impervious surface, white flower abundance, and humidity.
   Total arthropod abundance and diversity were positively associated with
   humidity. For specific orders, Hymenoptera (bees, ants, wasps) abundance
   was negatively associated with temperature, and positively associated
   with site perimeter-area ratio. Hemiptera (true bugs) were negatively
   associated with impervious surface and positively associated with
   humidity. These findings show that impervious surfaces impact arthropod
   communities, but many of the observed changes were driven by local
   abiotic conditions like temperature and humidity. This suggests that
   management decisions within urban greenspaces are important in
   determining the structure of arthropod communities. Future studies on
   arthropods in cities should determine whether manipulating the abiotic
   conditions of urban greenspaces influences the composition of arthropod
   communities. These results should inform city planners and homeowners of
   the need to properly manage urban greenspaces in cities to maintain
   diverse arthropod assemblages.},

Title = {Accounting for detectability when estimating avian abundance in an urban
   area},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {391-397},
Abstract = {Urban areas can support significant bird populations, including species
   of conservation concern, but urban ecologists have been slow to apply
   detectability-based counting techniques. We compared abundances and
   relative abundances of eight urban birds, derived using two commonly
   applied techniques (fixed-radius point and strip sampling) and distance
   sampling. We evaluated the influence of habitat and two covariates
   (observer and whether birds were seen or heard) on detectability. Due to
   built-up structures in urban areas, point counts are appropriate.
   Unavoidable and sometimes complex but necessary interactions with
   multiple property owners may compromise the number of points able to be
   counted and therefore the precision of estimates. Abundances from strip
   and fixed-radius point counts were on average only one-third (strip) and
   less than one-half (fixed-radius point) those obtained using distance
   sampling, with interspecific variation in the degree to which densities
   were underestimated. Rankings of relative abundances were mostly
   similar, although distance sampling ranked silvereye (Zosterops
   lateralis) and grey warbler (Geggone igata) relatively higher in
   residential habitat. Habitat did not appear to influence detectability
   for most species, but the two covariates (observer and seen/heard)
   improved model fit for a number of species, indicating it is useful to
   record this information. Well-standardised non-detectability-based
   counts could provide useful information on community structure and
   relative abundances in urban areas, but distance sampling is necessary
   to track the population status of species, although it cannot usefully
   be applied to rare species.},

Title = {Decentralized composting: gated communities as ecologically promising
   environments},
Journal = {ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {95},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {The global need to strengthen circular economic chains highlights the
   importance of composting, since the organic fraction corresponds, on
   average, to 50\% of the municipal solid waste. As centralized composting
   programs have been showing slow advances, especially in low and
   middle-income countries, the decentralized scale is a promising tool.
   Gated communities stand out as potential targets for decentralized
   composting programs, as they generally have organization, tools,
   employees, space, and a high density of gardens. This study detected,
   through online questionnaires sent to residents of gated communities, a
   high probability of adherence to composting programs in the condominium,
   predisposition for waste sorting, use of the compost, and participation
   in meetings to address the issue, in addition to a relevant potential
   for reducing the disposal of organic waste in landfills. On the other
   hand, the absence of leaders, lack of knowledge about community projects
   and fear of unpleasant odors and pests were evidenced. Among 106
   respondents, residents of 25 condominiums, no variability was detected
   between positions of different genders, ages, and education. This
   diagnosis points out challenges and suggests alternatives to overcome
   them, based on successful experiences, focused on strengthening
   leadership, technical training, provision of equipment, improvements in
   communication and socio-environmental awareness.},

Abstract = {One hundred ninety-five 6- to 7-year-old children who lived in the
   municipality of Siena (Tuscany, Italy) underwent biologic monitoring to
   evaluate urinary excretion of several alkylphosphates that are
   metabolites of organophosphorus pesticides. We evaluated
   dimethylphosphate (DMP), dimethylthiophasphate (DMTP),
   dimethyldithiophosphate (DMDTP), diethylphosphate (DEP),
   diethylthiophosphate (DETP), and diethyldithiophosphate (DEDTP). We
   obtained urine samples taken in the children's schools, and each sample
   was accompanied by a questionnaire about lifestyle and dietary habits.
   We found DMP and DMTP in detectable concentrations in the greatest
   number of samples (96 and 94\%, respectively). Thr DMP values were
   geometric mean (CM) 116.7, {[}geometric standard deviation (GSD) 2.5],
   and a range of 7.4-1,471.5 nmol/g creatinine. The corresponding DMTP
   values were GM 104.3 (GSD 2.8) and a range of 4.0-1,526.0 nmol/g
   creatinine. DMDTP, DEP, DETP, and DEDTP concentrations were GM 14.1,
   (GSD 3.0), and a range of 3.3-754.6 nmol/g creatinine in 34\% of the
   children; GM 33.2, (CSD 2.4), and a range of 5.1-360.1 nmol/g creatinine

   48\% of the children; and GM 7.7, (GSD 2.1), and a range of 2.3-140.1 in
   12\% of the children, respectively. The significant variable for urinary
   excretion of these metabolites in children was pest control operations
   performed inside or outside the house in the preceding month; however,
   the presence of a vegetable garden near the house rarely emerged. The
   urinary excretion of alkylphosphates in children was significantly
   higher than in a group of the adult population resident in the same

Abstract = {Previous studies have suggested an association between exposure to
   pesticides and different types of childhood cancer. This paper presents
   results from a population-based case-control interview study of parents
   of children less than 15 years of age, which was conducted in the states
   of West Germany from 1993 to 1997. Cases were 1,184 children with
   leukemia, 234 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 940 with a solid tumor;
   2,588 controls were also included. Parental occupational exposures were
   found to be related to childhood cancer regardless of the time period of
   exposure and the type of cancer. This finding might partially be
   explained by different recall of past exposures by the parents of cases
   and controls. Residential use of insecticides was associated with
   childhood lymphoma: both extermination of insects by professional pest
   controllers (odds ratio (OR) = 2.6, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.2,
   5.7) and frequency of parental use of household insecticides (p for
   trend = 0.02) were significant risk factors for this diagnosis. The use
   of pesticides on farms was weakly related to childhood leukemia (OR =
   1.5, 95\% CI: 1.0, 2.2), while their use in gardens was not associated
   with childhood leukemia (OR = 1.0, 95\% CI: 0.8, 1.2). The major
   strengths of this study were the population base and the large number of
   cases and controls included; a drawback was assessment of exposure on
   the basis of parental interviews. The data provide some evidence for an
   increased leukemia risk for children living on farms and for an
   association between use of household pesticides and risk of childhood
   leukemia or lymphoma.},

Abstract = {Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) are known to have a wide
   range of negative impacts upon nearby residents and communities.
   Therefore, the siting of such operations in economically underdeveloped
   rural communities is an important environmental justice issue. This
   study explores the environmental conflict that surrounded a proposed
   CAFO in Bayfield County, Wisconsin. In this struggle, an outside
   corporation attempted to site a new CAFO in a community that was highly
   divided on the issue. We draw complementary insights from the
   environmental justice, stakeholder theory, and rural studies literatures
   to explain how the opponents of the CAFO were ultimately able to
   successfully resist the unwanted land use. This theoretical framework
   treats the formation of environmental inequalities as a process of
   conflict among diverse parties in which the potentially impacted
   communities may strongly influence the eventual outcome. Through
   interviews with key stakeholders and analysis of local and state media
   sources, we examine the primary points of contention within the local
   community along with the relative claims making and discursive
   strategies employed by each side. The findings of this study imply that
   how rural communities construct their identity and define potential
   environmental hazards are central to deciding environmental conflicts.},

Abstract = {Green space matters for mental health but is under constant pressure in
   an increasingly urbanising world. Often there is little space available
   in cities for green areas, so it is vital to optimise the design and
   usage of these available green spaces. To achieve this, experts in
   planning, design and nature conservation need to know which types and
   characteristics of green spaces are most beneficial for residents'
   mental health.A scoping review of studies that compare different green
   space types and characteristics on mental health was conducted. A total
   of 215 (experimental, observational and qualitative) papers were
   included in the scoping review.This review highlights a high level of
   heterogeneity in study design, geographical locations, mental health
   outcomes and green space measures. Few of the included studies were
   specifically designed to enable direct comparisons between green space
   types and characteristics (e.g. between parks and forests). The included
   studies have predominantly experimental research designs looking at the
   effects of short-term exposure to green space on short-term mental
   health outcomes (e.g. affect and physiological stress). More studies
   enabled only indirect comparisons, either within the same study or
   between different studies.Analysis of the direction of the mental health
   outcomes (positive, neutral, negative) from exposure to various types
   and characteristics of green space found positive (i.e. beneficial)
   effects across all green space types. However, green space
   characteristics did appear to render more diverse effects on mental
   health, which is especially the case for vegetation characteristics
   (e.g. higher vegetation density can be negative for mental health).The
   scoping review reveals gaps in the present evidence base, with a
   specific need for more studies directly comparing green space types and
   characteristics within the same study. Proposed future research
   directions include the use of longitudinal research designs focusing on
   green space characteristics, considering actual exposure and
   systematically addressing heterogeneity in factors influencing the
   relation between green spaces and mental health (e.g. type of
   interaction, user experience).Read the free Plain Language Summary for

Abstract = {Feeding wild bird is popular in domestic gardens across the world, with
   around half of households in the UK, North America and Australia doing
   so. Nevertheless, there is surprisingly little empirical information on
   many aspects of the activity. We sought to characterise garden bird
   feeding in a large UK urban area in two ways. First, we conducted
   face-to-face questionnaires with a representative cross-section of
   residents. Just over half fed birds, the majority doing so year-round
   and at least weekly. Second, a 2-year, longitudinal study recorded all
   foodstuffs put out by households on every provisioning occasion. In this
   way, we obtained the first year-round quantitative records of the
   amounts and types of wild bird food provided in individual gardens. A
   median of 127 g, equivalent to 628 kcal, was given daily per household
   (typically consisting of several food types). We estimated the daily
   cost of this provisioning level to be UK 0.35 pound per household based
   on the relative proportions of each food type. Provisioning level was
   not significantly influenced by weather or season. Comparisons between
   the data sets revealed significantly less frequent feeding amongst the
   feeders in the longitudinal study (assumed to be `keen' feeders owing to
   their participation in this long-term study and numbers of food types
   provided) than the face-to-face questionnaire respondents, suggesting
   that questionnaires relying upon participants' estimates rather than
   records of provisioning may overestimate actual provisioning frequency.
   Assuming 100\% uptake, the median provisioning level equates to
   sufficient supplementary resources across the UK to fully support 196
   million individuals of a hypothetical average garden-feeding bird
   species (based on 10 common UK garden-feeding birds' energy
   requirements). This compares with an estimated total of 71 million
   breeding individuals of these 10 species in the UK (non-breeding numbers
   unknown). Taking the lowest provisioning level recorded (101 kcal/day)
   as a conservative measure, 31 million of these average individuals could
   theoretically be supported.},

Abstract = {A survey of Australian Magpies, Gymnorhina tibicen, in Kings Park,
   Perth, Western Australia, in 1938 identified 84 individuals in nine
   groups. The survey was repeated 62 years later in 2000 and identified 98
   magpies in 19 groups. The sex and age composition of the population
   during the two surveys was broadly similar, with 69\% of the birds in
   1938 classed as adult and 75\% in 2000. In 1938, 31\% of the population
   were adult males and 38\% adult females compared with 40\% and 35\%
   respectively in 2000. Seven of the areas occupied by groups in 1938 were
   also occupied by one or more groups in 2000. The greater number of
   groups in 2000 is partly due to two or more groups occupying areas used
   by one in 1938. Also in 2000, several groups occupied parts of Kings
   Park where no magpies were recorded in 1938, but the territories of two
   groups in 1938 were unoccupied in 2000. In part, the increase in the
   number of magpies and groups since 1938 is the result of clearing large
   areas of bushland and replacing it with lawns and gardens, thereby
   creating more habitat for magpies. The remainder of the increase may be
   the result of more regular watering of lawns and gardens in the park,
   increasing the food resources available to magpies as water supplies
   improved. The areas not used in 2000 may have become too densely
   vegetated or affected by increased traffic on the main road along the
   park's northern boundary, which may restrict movements of magpies
   between the park and the lawns and parks of the adjoining residential
   area.},

Abstract = {In the face of global forest ecosystem decline, non-protected
   transboundary areas like agroforestry can play a crucial role for
   conserving avian species. A comprehensive study on agroforestry birds in
   Tetulia, the northernmost area of Bangladesh, was conducted across four
   sites from November 2021 to October 2022. A total of 174 species (5479
   contacts) of avifauna were recorded. The order Passeriformes had the
   highest avian diversity (70 species, 40.22\%), followed by
   Charadriiformes (20 species, 11.50\%), Accipitriformes (17 species,
   9.77\%), and Pelecaniformes (13 species,7.47\%). The species list showed
   that resident birds were higher (122 species, 70.11\%) than migratory
   birds (52 species, 29.89\%). The highest richness (144 species),
   abundance (N = 1581), and diversity (H = 4.522, Ds = 0.984) were
   observed in site A1. The heterogenous nature of site A1 contributed to
   this result although spatial bird diversity was non-significant. The
   highest species richness, abundance, and diversity indices of birds
   showed in the winter season because of the presence of migratory
   species. The frequent bird activity, less anthropogenic pressure, and
   high detection probability during winter can influence the seasonal bird
   diversity result. The homestead habitats displayed the highest diversity
   indices (H = 4.051, Ds = 0.977) and evenness (E = 0.736) due to the
   diversity of plants. Birds in tea garden and agricultural land shared
   similar species, while water bodies associated with tea garden had more
   distinct species with a negative correlation value. The low-contrast
   edge between tea garden and agricultural land made a positive relation
   in bird composition. The top ten abundant species contributed 28.71\% of
   total and jungle babbler (Turdoides striata) had the highest relative
   abundance. The baseline data we have collected holds significant
   potential for informing future research endeavors. Policymakers can
   leverage this foundational information to initiate conservation measures
   aimed at protecting the avifauna within the study site.},

Title = {Citizen Science Helps Uncover the Secrets to a Bat-Friendly Swimming
   Pool in an Urban Environment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {For urban environments to support bat communities, resources need to be
   readily available. For example, bats typically use urban water sources
   such as drainage ditches and ponds; however, these sources can be
   ephemeral. During these periods, bats have utilized residential swimming
   pools, although they only appear to drink at pools when access to more
   natural equivalents are limited. This posed the question ``can we make
   residential swimming pools friendlier for a diversity of bat
   species?{''} Using citizen science to determine which pool
   characteristics influenced bat activity, we distributed a questionnaire
   to residents in a suburban neighborhood in Fort Worth, TX, United
   States. It focused on observations of bat activity and the features of
   the pools and immediate surroundings. We distributed the questionnaire
   through social media, local presentations, and by mail throughout 2019
   and 2020. We then used classification trees to determine which
   characteristics in combination influenced bat activity at the pools. We
   generated three different trees for bats observed (1) flying around the
   property and backyard, (2) above the swimming pool, and (3) drinking at
   the pool. We found that more bats were observed at unlit pools without
   bush or shrub borders. Furthermore, among pools with borders, activity
   was lowest at pools with textured interiors and >= 6 trees visible. The
   presence of features, such as fountains, then contributed to a reduction
   in bat observations in backyards and the presence of pets appeared to
   further reduce activity specifically over the pools. Where bats were
   observed drinking, this activity was reported the least at pools with
   bush or shrub borders, textured interiors, and trees 10 m from the edge
   of the pools. Our study revealed that certain characteristics of
   residential swimming pools encouraged bat activity, while others
   discouraged them. Thus, it may be possible to make swimming pools more
   bat-friendly. For example, turning lights off in the evening when
   backyards are not in use and reducing clutter around pools could have an
   immediate positive impact on local bat populations. The implementation
   of such recommendations could improve urban habitats for bats overall
   and alleviate some of the negative implications of continued
   urbanization.},

Title = {Traditional homegardens change to perennial monocropping of khat (Catha
   edulis) reduced woody species and enset conservation and climate change
   mitigation potentials of the Wondo Genet landscape of southern Ethiopia},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Smallholder farmers in the Wondo Genet were forced to switch from
   long-standing, diverse traditional home gardens to monoculture khat
   production due to increasing population pressureinduced farmland
   constraints. The composition of woody species and the biomass carbon
   stock are thought to drop as homegardens transition from polyculture to
   monoculture; however there is little quantitative evidence to support
   this claim. This study was started to assess the effects on woody
   species, enset, and biomass carbon of converting traditional homegardens
   to a fast spreading perennial monocropping of khat (Catha edulis
   Forskal). In 10 m x 10 m (100m2) plots from 43 farms with neighboring
   land use patterns for each homegarden and khat, woody species and enset
   were inventoried, the total number of tree, shrub, and enset species
   counted, as well as the height and diameter of each species measured. To
   determine the biomass carbon stock of each land use type, both general
   and species-specific allometric equations are used. Simpson's diversity
   index, Shannon-Wiener, and Shannon equitability were used to evaluate
   the diversity of enset and woody species. There were 27 different types
   of woody species identified, with trees making up 67 \% of the total and
   shrubs accounting for 33 \%. Shannon, Simpson, and the richness of woody
   species all decreased by 46 \%, 51 \%, and 38 \%, respectively, in
   comparison to residential gardens. For homegardens and khat,
   respectively, the mean Evenness values were 0.876 and 0.539. In
   homegardens, Coffea arabica was the most valuable woody species,
   followed by Cordia africana Lam, Persea americana, Eucalyptus
   camaldulensis, and Grevillea Robusta. In contrast, Catha edulis was the
   most valuable woody species in the Khat land use type, followed by
   Coffea arabica, Croton macrostachyus Del, and Cordia africana. In
   comparison to homegardens, the aboveground, below-ground, and total
   biomass carbon reported in khat land use types were reduced by 18 \%, 63
   \%, and 42 \%, respectively. Grevillea and Eucalyptus species made up 51
   \% of the total biomass carbon stock in the homegardens, which suggests
   that khat and quickly expanding fast-growing plants have displaced
   native woody species.Understanding the long-term effects of
   agro-biodiversity loss requires greater research on the implications of
   the decline in woody species diversity and biomass carbon stock on soil
   fertility and sustainable farming. This is due to the numerous functions
   that woody species and enset play.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Background: Rove beetles of the genus Paederus cause dermatitis when
   they come in contact with human skin. This condition is prevalent in
   some tropical and subtropical regions, such as in northern Pakistan,
   where it was recorded for the first time by US troops. Despite much
   research from other countries on this subject, few studies, mostly
   clinical, have been performed in a Pakistani context. A survey was
   carried out in villages, towns and cities of Punjab province, Pakistan,
   to explore the rove beetle population dynamics and to develop a model to
   elucidate the symptoms, preventive measures and treatment strategies for
   this dermatitis.
   Methods: The prospective observational and patient surveys were
   performed bimonthly over a period of two years, in different districts
   of Punjab province. Collection was carried out in fields, gardens and
   houses during every visit with the aid of a pitfall trap, light trap,
   flight intercept trap, Berlese funnel trap and sweep netting. These
   traps were installed for four days during every visit. Interviews of ten
   individuals of different ages and sexes from each site were recorded
   during each visit.
   Results: Out of 980 individuals, 26.4\% were found to suffer from
   Paederus dermatitis. Lesions were most commonly found on the neck
   followed by the face. In July-August during the rainy season, this skin
   irritation was most prevalent and the population of these beetles peaked
   (36.2\%). During May-June, the beetle population was lowest (7.85\%) due
   to soil dryness. About 70\% of such irritation cases were from
   individuals living in farming villages or in farmhouses. Their houses
   typically (80\%) had broken doors and screen-less windows while 97\% of
   the residents were unaware of how they may have come into contact with
   these beetles. In most cases (91\% from villages/small towns and 24\%
   from cities and adjoining areas) the local residents were unaware of
   modern treatment strategies.
   Conclusions: Paederus dermatitis is extremely frequent in villages with
   poor housing facilities and could be avoided via community awareness.},

Abstract = {Feeding wild birds creates an important link between homeowners and
   conservation. The effects of bird feeders and year-round feeding on
   birds have not been well studied, however, particularly in relationship
   to bird-window collisions. We determined effects of bird feeder presence
   and placement on bird-window collisions at residential homes. Paired
   month-long trials in which a feeder was either present or absent for one
   month and then removed or added for the second month were completed at
   55 windows at 43 houses. In each trial, homeowners were asked to search
   their study window daily for evidence of a bird-window collision. During
   the study there were 51 collisions when there was no bird feeder and 94
   when the feeder was present. The season when each trial was set up was
   the best individual predictor of bird-window collisions. The largest
   number of collisions was observed during fall migration and the lowest
   during the winter months. There were no collisions at 26 of the study
   windows. High variance was observed in the number of collisions at
   different houses, indicating that effects of bird feeders are context
   dependent. Changing the occurrence, timing, and placement of feeders can
   alter collision rates but is only one of many factors that influence
   whether a residential house is likely to have a bird window-collision or
   not.},

Abstract = {Maya Q'eqchi' villagers of Alta Verapaz, Guatemala fathom local

   the local queues and timing of residents' practices as a baseline for
   monitoring subsequent years' activities and climate-related observations

   Using focus groups, we collected such traditional indicators to design a

   This seasonal calendar is a locally accessible tool to document monthly
   climate observations, agricultural and home garden activities, hunting,
   animal raising, and cultural activities during a complete annual cycle.
   We supplement observational and focus group data with semi-structured
   interview data about subsequent changes in weather patterns, which

   Maya Q'eqchi' villagers are active in their acknowledgment of climate
   change and are taking steps to document its effects on locally
   significant cultural activities, exemplifying Q'eqchi' cultural capacity
   to adapt to ecological changes and to promote local resilience and

   to create them may contribute to local and global understandings of TEK
   and climate change and annotate conventional anthropological methods as

Title = {Outdoor spatial spraying against dengue: A false sense of security among
   inhabitants of Hermosillo, Mexico},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background
   Government-administered adulticiding is frequently conducted in response
   to dengue transmission worldwide. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
   spraying may create a ``false sense of security' for residents. Our
   objective was to determine if there was an association between
   residents' reporting outdoor spatial insecticide spraying as way to
   prevent dengue transmission and both their reported frequency of dengue
   prevention practices and household entomological indices in Hermosillo,
   Mexico.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   A non-probabilistic survey of 400 households was conducted in August
   2014. An oral questionnaire was administered to an adult resident and
   the outer premises of the home were inspected for water-holding
   containers and presence of Ae. aegypti larvae and pupae. Self-reported
   frequency of prevention practices were assessed among residents who
   reported outdoor spatial spraying as a strategy to prevent dengue (n =
   93) and those who did not (n = 307). Mixed effects negative binomial
   regression was used to assess associations between resident's reporting
   spraying as a means to prevent dengue and container indices. Mixed
   effects logistic regression was used to determine associations with
   presence/absence of larvae and pupae. Those reporting spatial spraying
   disposed of trash less frequently and spent less time indoors to avoid
   mosquitoes. They also used insecticides and larvicides more often and
   covered their water containers more frequently. Their backyards had more
   containers positive for Ae. aegypti (RR = 1.92) and there was a higher
   probability of finding one or more Ae. aegypti pupae (OR = 2.20). Survey
   respondents that reported spatial spraying prevented dengue were more
   likely to be older and were exposed to fewer media sources regarding
   prevention.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The results suggest that the perception that outdoor spatial spraying
   prevents dengue is associated with lower adoption of prevention
   practices and higher entomological risk. This provides some support to
   the hypothesis that spraying may lead to a ``false sense of
   security{''}. Further investigations to clarify this relationship should
   be conducted. Government campaigns should emphasize the difficulty in
   controlling Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and the need for both government and
   community action to minimize risk of dengue transmission.},

   their own landscaping and, therefore, fully controlled the amount of
   applied chemicals and the area of application. Fertilizers were
   primarily applied to lawns, but a high percentage of homeowners also
   applied them to trees, shrubs, and flowers. Insecticides were applied by
   a larger percentage of homeowners than herbicides. Control of fire ants
   (Solenopsis invicta) was likely the reason behind the frequent use of
   insecticides. The desire for a weed free lawn was the plausible
   motivation behind the use of herbicides, which were used mostly on
   lawns. Fungicide use was infrequently reported by Georgia homeowners.
   The pattern of fertilizer and pesticide use suggests that the developed

Abstract = {BackgroundThe nursing home residents' ability to carry out Activities of
   Daily Living (ADLs) is influenced by the physical care environment. One
   emerging area of interest in scientific research is the green care
   environment within nursing home care, where agricultural activities such
   as gardening and animal care are integrated alongside daily care.
   Previous research has neglected to explore how these environments can be
   employed to enhance ADL performance. This study, therefore, explores how
   a green care environment, specifically one with an animal shelter, can
   be used to support nursing home residents in their ADLs.MethodsA focused
   ethnographic case study was conducted in one nursing home. Data was
   collected employing participatory observations, informal conversations,
   and semi-structured interviews, which we analyzed by employing a
   thematic analysis.ResultsOverall, 25 residents were observed for a total
   time of 89h, and interviews were conducted with 10 staff members. The
   nursing home integrates activities in the green care environment into
   daily care for a broad scope of residents. The analysis revealed four
   themes: (1) The (in)visibility of ADL, (2) Reciprocal care dynamics:
   Fostering ADL performance through connection and teamwork, (3) Seized
   and missed opportunities for meaningful integration of ADL in the
   physical green care environment, and Theme (4) Professional fulfillment
   and ADL task obligation: Views from staff and management.ConclusionsThis
   physical green care environment carries the potential to enhance the

Abstract = {Invasive alien species are considered a major contributor to
   biodiversity loss. Yet, many are favoured for particular ecosystem
   services that they provide. This is often so in urban environments
   experiencing rapid environmental and social change and land
   transformation. Public support is viewed as critical for invasive alien
   species prevention and management. Furthermore, it is assumed that local
   citizens are more likely to be willing and ready to engage if they are
   informed about the costs and benefits associated with invasive alien
   species. However, the use of, and attitudes towards, invasive alien
   species in urban areas is poorly understood, especially regarding urban
   gardens under private ownership and control. This lack of understanding
   is likely to compromise potential management interventions. Here, we
   report on a survey of 240 people across 12 small towns in the Eastern
   Cape province of South Africa to determine their knowledge and
   perceptions regarding woody invasive alien plants (IAPs), their
   willingness to engage in control and how these vary in relation to
   respondent attributes. The findings indicated that respondents have low
   levels of knowledge about woody IAPs despite 84\% of them having at
   least one woody IAP species in their garden. Nineteen different woody
   IAPs were noted across the sample of 240 households. A wide range of
   ecosystem services and disservices from woody IAPs were mentioned.
   Because of the benefits provided, or the effort required to remove them,
   only 56\% of respondents were willing to have the woody IAPs removed
   from their gardens, with most considering it the responsibility of
   government agencies to do so. There was a positive association between
   the levels of education, income, and the impression that woody IAPs pose
   a problem and being aware of the term, but not willingness to remove
   them. Synthesis and implications. These results reveal the complex
   relationship that urban citizens have with IAPs in garden settings, and
   for authorities to consider appropriate and targeted awareness campaigns
   if control strategies are to be successful.Read the free Plain Language

Abstract = {Plant species that receive significant human introduction effort and
   assistance generally are the most problematic invaders. Despite this,
   invasive ornamental species in urban settings have received relatively
   little attention if not invading natural areas. Here we consider
   Centranthus ruber in an urban setting in South Africa as a case study
   and explore when emerging invaders are able to cross the urban-wildland
   interface and what hinders early eradication in urban environments.
   Centranthus ruber was introduced into Cape Town, South Africa, more than
   a century ago as a garden ornamental, but until recently was not
   considered invasive. We determine the current and potential future
   distribution in South Africa, evaluate current management activities,
   and provide recommendations for control and legislation. By August 2013,
   we had found 64 populations, of which 31 were casual, 27 naturalized,
   and 6 invasive. This increased to more than 530 identified populations
   by the end of 2015, due to both spread and increased awareness.
   Centranthus ruber can invade near-pristine areas, with one population
   found in natural vegetation in the Table Mountain National Park.
   However, with only one slowly spreading population, the threat might be
   limited. We found no difference in plant mortality between chemical and
   mechanical clearing, but with mechanical clearing stimulating the soil
   seedbank, we recommend chemical methods. Using a species distribution
   model, we found large parts of South Africa, including the southwestern
   Cape where we conducted our surveys, to be climatically suitable for
   this species. Consequently, the category 1b regional listing in NEM: BA
   in the Western Cape is justified, but a listing in other parts of the
   country also might be appropriate. Based on our findings, we suggest
   that the extirpation of C. ruber in South Africa is possible, but
   without buy-in from residents in urban environments, reinvasion will
   render this impossible. This study stresses the importance of managing
   and legislating emerging invaders at the urban-wildland interface and
   the monitoring of common ornamental species with invasive traits.},

Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Urban green spaces (UGS) deliver a wide range of regulating,
   provisioning and cultural ecosystem services (CES), relevant to support
   the achievement of some United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
   (e.g., Goal 11: sus-tainable cities and communities, and Goal 3: good
   health and well-being). However, knowledge of preferences and uses of
   UGS by urban dwellers is still lacking. This study assesses the CES
   perceived by different users in five distinct urban parks located in
   Coimbra, Portugal: Manuel Braga (secular park), Botanical garden,
   Choupal national forest, Mondego green park (large area placed next to
   the river), and Vale das Flores (linear park located in a residential
   area). A questionnaire survey was performed in each park to investigate
   the activities performed and their relevance for the users, users'
   motivations to develop the activities on that specific UGS, the
   perceived benefits regarding physical and emotional well-being and
   social interactions, and users' perception about disser-vices. The
   results showed that walking, meeting people, practicing and doing
   activities with children are the ac-tivities performed by most users and
   are perceived as beneficial for physical and emotional well-being.
   Multifunctionality is a characteristic of all parks and highly
   appreciated by the users. Significant differences in socio-demographic
   characteristics of the users and motivations are recorded between parks.
   The tranquillity of space and landscape beauty are the main motivations
   to use Manuel Braga Park and the Botanical garden. Distance to the park
   and transportation means are particularly important for Botanical garden
   and Vale das Flores park users. Age group and average monthly income
   were associated in both Choupal national forest, Mondego green park and
   Vale das Flores park, denoting that older and wealthier users are more
   able to enjoy these parks. Users' problems or ecosystem disservices were
   not identified, although plagues (e.g., mosquitoes) and dangerous
   animals recorded average concerns in the Choupal national forest and in
   the Vale das Flores and Mondego green parks. This work's findings can
   help decision-makers better understand users' needs and expectations,
   thus improving UGS design and management to attract more citizens. (c)

Abstract = {Although frequently reported from within the Brisbane city boundaries,
   the range of the Australian brush-turkey, Alectura lathami, was limited
   mainly to forested areas adjacent to suburban areas.  Since the early
   1970s, however, the species' presence in the suburbs has increased
   steadily and it is now common in many suburbs.  Destruction and
   disruption of gardens during the construction of incubation mounds has
   led to a significant conflict with householders.  This study found the
   species to be most abundant in suburbs adjacent to forest reserves and
   major watercourses.  A number of extremely isolated populations were
   also identified.  Although suburban mounds contained similar numbers of
   eggs as mounds from the wild, suburban mounds were more prone to
   failure, probably due to the use of inappropriate mound materials. 
   Despite some evidence of increasing spread within the suburbs, the
   long-term survival of the species is seriously threatened by hatchling
   predation and continued loss of habitat.},

Title = {Why garden? - Attitudes and the perceived health benefits of home
   gardening},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {112},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Domestic (home) gardens provide opportunities for psychological and
   physical health benefits, yet these environments have received less
   attention in terms of their therapeutic value compared to other urban
   green spaces. This is despite their ubiquity and the popularity of
   gardening as a pastime. This research explored why residents engaged
   with gardening and the extent to which they recognised any health
   benefits from the activity. A questionnaire was distributed
   electronically within the UK, with 5766 gardeners and 249 non-gardeners
   responding. Data were collated on factors including garden typology,
   frequency of gardening and individual perceptions of health and
   well-being. Significant associations were found between improvements in
   well-being, perceived stress and physical activity and more frequent
   gardening. Gardening on a frequent basis i.e. at least 2-3 times a week,
   corresponded with greatest perceived health benefits. Improving health,
   however, was not the prime motivator to garden, but rather the direct
   pleasure gardening brought to the participants. There was evidence that
   satisfaction with one's front garden and the time spent in it increased
   as the proportion of vegetation was enhanced. The data supports the
   notion that domestic gardens should be given greater prominence in urban
   planning debates, due to the role they play in providing health
   benefits.},

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {293-302},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Urban landscapes are often florally rich due to extensive management of
   cultivated plants around the city. High abundance and diversity of these
   floral resources has been linked to more abundant and diverse pollinator
   communities, but little is known about how urban pollinators select from
   the wide variety of available flowers. This study provides unique
   insight into urban plant-pollinator interactions by examining how many
   plant taxa, and which taxa, are visited by pollinators. Over a
   three-year period, we observed foraging of urban pollinators across 63
   neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois (USA). We observed 1815
   plant-pollinator interactions between 24 pollinator morpho-types and 106
   plant taxa. An additional 57 plant taxa were flowering but not visited
   by pollinators. On average, each pollinator morpho-type visited 19 plant
   taxa, and most pollinators showed generalist tendencies. We identified
   42 plant taxa that were visited by more pollinator morpho-types than
   their floral abundance would predict; we call these `highly attractive'
   plants. In general, perennial and native plants received more pollinator
   visits than their counterparts, and ornamental plants were visited by
   more species than unintentional `weeds'. However, the two most-visited
   plant taxa were non-native, perennial weeds. Our results suggest that
   many flowering plants in cities are not visited by pollinators.
   Furthermore, the plant-pollinator network could be reduced to only four
   plant taxa without losing any pollinator morpho-types. To enhance urban
   pollinator conservation, urban residents can select ornamental plants
   from our list of `highly attractive' plant taxa, or can allow some of
   the highly attractive `weeds' to persist in their gardens.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Urban green spaces such as gardens often consist of native and exotic
   plant species, which provide pollen and nectar for flower-visiting
   insects. Although some exotic plants are readily visited by pollinators,
   it is unknown if and at which time of the season exotic garden plants
   may supplement or substitute for flower resources provided by native
   plants. To investigate if seasonal changes in flower availability from
   native vs. exotic plants affect flower visits, diversity and
   particularly plant-pollinator interaction networks, we studied
   flower-visiting insects over a whole growing season in 20 urban
   residential gardens in Germany. Over the course of the season, visits to
   native plants decreased, the proportion of flower visits to exotics
   increased, and flower-visitor species richness decreased. Yet, the
   decline in flower-visitor richness over the season was slowed in gardens
   with a relatively higher proportion of flowering exotic plants. This
   compensation was more positively linked to the proportion of exotic
   plant species than to the proportion of exotic flower cover.
   Plant-pollinator interaction networks were moderately specialized.
   Interactions were more complex in high summer, but interaction
   diversity, linkage density, and specialisation were not influenced by
   the proportion of exotic species. Thus, later in the season when few
   native plants flowered, exotic garden plants partly substituted for
   native flower resources without apparent influence on plant-pollinator
   network structure. Late-flowering garden plants support pollinator
   diversity in cities. If appropriately managed, and risk of
   naturalisation is minimized, late-flowering exotic plants may provide
   floral resources to support native pollinators when native plants are
   scarce.},

Abstract = {Few urban studies of avian diversity discriminate between native and
   exotic species, although highly modified urban environments typically
   support significant numbers of non-native species. High overall
   diversity may mask poor native diversity. We identify which native
   species are successful in a variety of urban habitats in a New Zealand
   city, and examine the roles that garden size and complexity, native
   fragments, and vegetation composition and cover play in explaining
   variations in native and exotic avian diversity. Nearly half(44\%) of 39
   species recorded were exotic: four(three exotic and one native)
   comprised 45\% of birds counted. While there was little variation
   between habitats in combined native and exotic species richness, the
   number and abundance of bush-dependent natives differed. Similarity
   measures identified three groups: (1) commercial, industrial and
   residential areas with small structurally simple gardens where 3-4
   exotic species were numerically dominant and few bush natives made up
   <10\% of the total count; (2) Suburbs with medium/large gardens
   dominated by lawns. shrubs and trees, with many exotic species but also
   several bush natives (comprising 24-32\% of the total count); and (3)
   bush fragments where both diversity and species richness of bush natives
   were highest (comprising 50-75\% of the total count), including four
   insectivores absent from all residential areas. Vegetation structure,
   composition and cover, and proximity to fragments did not explain much
   of the variation in total or native species richness and diversity, but

Volume = {179},
Number = {3},
Pages = {811-821},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Plantings in residential neighborhoods can support wild pollinators.
   However, it is unknown how effectively wild pollinators maintain
   pollination services in small, urban gardens with diverse floral
   resources. We used a `mobile garden' experimental design, whereby potted
   plants of cucumber, eggplant, and purple coneflower were brought to 30
   residential yards in Chicago, IL, USA, to enable direct assessment of
   pollination services provided by wild pollinator communities. We
   measured fruit and seed set and investigated the effect of within-yard
   characteristics and adjacent floral resources on plant pollination.
   Increased pollinator visitation and taxonomic richness generally led to
   increases in fruit and seed set for all focal plants. Furthermore, fruit
   and seed set were correlated across the three species, suggesting that
   pollination services vary across the landscape in ways that are
   consistent among different plant species. Plant species varied in terms
   of which pollinator groups provided the most visits and benefit for
   pollination. Cucumber pollination was linked to visitation by small
   sweat bees (Lasioglossum spp.), whereas eggplant pollination was linked
   to visits by bumble bees. Purple coneflower was visited by the most
   diverse group of pollinators and, perhaps due to this phenomenon, was
   more effectively pollinated in florally-rich gardens. Our results
   demonstrate how a diversity of wild bees supports pollination of
   multiple plant species, highlighting the importance of pollinator
   conservation within cities. Non-crop resources should continue to be
   planted in urban gardens, as these resources have a neutral and
   potentially positive effect on crop pollination.},

Volume = {144},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2151-2162},

Abstract = {Birds in woodland can be affected by increasing deer populations through
   changes to vegetation structure and potential impacts on foraging
   resources; these effects need to be better understood. Effects of deer
   browsing are reported from a replicated split-plot exclusion experiment
   in English coppiced woodland. All stages of growth were examined up to
   eight years after felling. We used standardised mist-netting (totaling
   1920 h) to sample birds in breeding and post-breeding periods. Deer
   browsing strongly altered vegetation structure by reducing canopy cover
   and shrub layer foliage density. However deer did not affect
   invertebrate density per unit of foliage, providing no evidence of an
   ungulate-mediated plant chemical response affecting forage quality for
   invertebrate herbivores. At avian guild level, significantly more ground
   and understorey foraging birds were captured where deer were excluded,
   and negative responses to browsing were more marked for pooled migrants
   than pooled residents. At the species level, especially pronounced
   negative effects were evident for dunnock (Prunella modularis) and
   garden warbler (Sylvia borin); approximately five times more dunnocks
   were captured in deer exclosures than in browsed vegetation. We also
   detected negative responses to browsing by nightingale (Luscinia
   megarhynchos) and long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus). No significant
   positive responses to browsing were detected. For some species the use
   of young re-growth increased post breeding relative to the breeding
   period, including a marked shift by pooled residents that involved a
   disproportionate number of juveniles. Previous studies in North America
   have shown that, through vegetation modification, ungulate activity can
   alter woodland bird assemblages; as far as we are aware this is the
   first experimental demonstration of effects in Europe, and at low to
   moderate browsing intensity typical of the wider landscape scale. (C)

Abstract = {Cities in the global South confront a multitude of environmental
   challenges, including air pollution, waste management issues, and
   biodiversity loss. Addressing these issues is vital for the welfare of
   residents in rapidly urbanising cities. Urban agriculture emerges as a
   proposed solution with the potential to mitigate some of these
   environmental challenges. There is a lack of research exploring the
   relationship between urban agriculture and environmental justice in the
   global South, particularly in marginalised neighbourhoods that bear the
   brunt of environmental injustice. To fill this research gap, the study
   examines how community gardens contribute to advancing environmental
   justice in low-income neighbourhoods of Cape Town, South Africa. To
   achieve this goal, a mixed-methods approach is adopted. Remote sensing
   techniques are utilised to compare land surface temperature values of
   selected gardens in Cape Flats with other suburbs in Cape Town.
   Additionally, semi-structured interviews and observations are conducted
   in 34 urban community gardens, purposively selected, to delve into how
   these gardens can address environmental injustices in the areas. The
   research findings uncover an unequal distribution of green spaces
   between wealthier and less affluent neighbourhoods in Cape Town. While
   the current benefits of gardening may not be widespread, the results
   indicate that urban community gardens offer numerous advantages, such as
   environmental education, promotion of agro-ecological practices, and the
   utilisation of land for green purposes. As repositories of knowledge
   promoting environmental justice, urban community gardens require
   institutional support aligned with their objectives to foster a fairer
   and more sustainable urban future.},

Abstract = {Urban parks, public buildings, school gardens, residences and open green
   spaces that we frequently encounter within urban landscape play an
   important role in the formation of urban identity. Urban identity
   created by utilizing environmental quality components provides users
   with a more habitable environment. Plant diversity in open green spaces
   affecting urban identity positively and providing users with a more
   habitable environment varies also in terms of identity and position of a
   city. This study conducted in Bartin in the Western Black Sea region
   consisted of three main phases intended for (i) examining Lamium
   purpureum L. var. purpureum in terms of users choices, (ii) evaluation
   of plant compositions created within urban landscape, and (iii) results
   of soil analysis of selected areas. A questionnaire study was applied to
   150 users about areas of usage of open green spaces and usage forms of
   Lamium purpureum L. var. purpureum found within the city, and
   appreciation of users was examined within this scope. In this regard,
   Lamium purpureum L. var. purpureum planting compositions within urban
   landscape were examined, they were taken into evaluation within 8
   different groups (road sides, rock gardens, open green spaces, curves,
   refuges, emphasis points, retaining walls and slopped (sand dune) lands)
   according to their characteristics, and the results of soil samples
   taken from each group were included. Consequently, recommendations
   intended for contribution of Lamium purpureum L. var. purpureum plant to
   urban landscape and the usability in sustainable urban green spaces were
   developed.},

Title = {Gardening work in an urban environment and the notion of territory},
Journal = {WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT \& REHABILITATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {77},
Number = {1},
Pages = {321-330},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are several characteristics of working in an urban
   environment that challenge the usual forms of work prescription.
   OBJECTIVE: This is a case study on the work of gardeners in an urban
   setting in the north of Paris. This paper develops the notion of
   territory, which we define as a system that is locally rooted in an open
   environment through the situated actions of gardeners' work. As the
   employees do their work in an outside environment, interactions in
   real-life situations are beyond the control of work organization. City
   gardeners' work is carried out in a green, living and human environment.
   METHODS: We conducted detailed open observations in a town's green
   zones. These were complemented by individual interviews in work
   situations and by collective interviews within the boundaries of the
   municipality.
   RESULTS: We use the notion of territory to highlight the particularity
   of work within organizations where the work environment cannot be
   limited to the space inside their walls. The gardeners' work makes it
   possible to link residents and passers-by (on foot or in vehicles) with
   the town's green spaces (micro-ecosystems). Their work consists in
   connecting the different expectations and needs of the various life
   forms: the human beings (with a variety of lifestyles), as well as the
   plants, insects and animals.
   CONCLUSION: The particularities of working in an open environment create
   complex forms of prescription. The notion of territory, rarely used in
   ergonomics, proves to be fruitful for considering work in these
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Urban ecosystems and ecosystem services have received little research
   attention in South Asian countries where rapid urban development is
   currently problematic. We developed a typology of urban ecosystems and
   an inventory of current ecosystem services for Dhaka - the capital of
   Bangladesh. Our observations, surveys, analyses, and evaluation revealed
   a diversity of urban ecosystems including khal (canal), pond, wetland,
   cultivated land, park/rooftop garden, playground/field, open
   space/vacant plot, roadside trees, and graveyards. Important
   provisioning services included fruits, vegetables, fish, fodder, timber,
   fuelwood, and medicinal/ornamental plants. Regulating services included
   carbon sequestration and particulate matter removal by park and roadside
   trees, drainage service by khals and wetlands, and noise abatement by
   parks. Opportunities for recreation, fishing and sports, walk/exercise,
   inspirations for art and culture and religious values presented cultural
   services. Habitat services such as refugia for resident and migratory
   birds featured in parks, lakes, wetlands and trees on roadsides,
   playgrounds/fields, and graveyards. Evaluation of the states and values
   of urban ecosystems and ecosystem services are prerequisites to
   improving the wellbeing of urban communities particularly in Dhaka but
   more generally for other major cities in South Asia. Our findings will
   assist policy makers in sustainable urban ecosystem governance with
   possible implications for region-wide cooperation.},

Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {46},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Cities across the world increasingly reflect the ethno-cultural
   diversity of a globalized society. How people interact with, and
   experience urban nature varies with the form, structure, and function of
   the space, but also with peoples' ethno-cultural identity. In this
   study, we investigated the values that gardeners and park users of
   different ethno-cultural identities associate with urban community
   gardens, parks and trees and the well-being benefits that they derive
   from them in Melbourne, Australia. We collected data from park users,
   and gardeners using intercept questionnaires with open-ended questions
   about motivations to garden and the importance of parks and trees to
   understand values, and standardized metrics on personal well-being to
   understand well-being benefits. The results show that gardeners and park
   users of different ethno-cultural identities than Australian and
   European, derived from the country of birth, language spoken, and region
   of origin, associate different motivations, importance, and well-being
   benefits to these different urban nature spaces. Community gardens
   provide food and a strong sense of community and security, particularly
   for gardeners that speak English as a second language. For these
   ethno-culturally diverse people, urban parks, like community gardens,
   are associated with sociocultural and psychological importance, but also
   with aesthetic importance. Finally, and also for these diverse people,
   urban trees are associated with aesthetic, naturalness and biodiversity
   importance rather than sociocultural importance. The results highlight
   that people involved in the planning and design of urban nature spaces
   should consider the many values associated with and benefits derived
   from different types of spaces for multicultural cities.},

Abstract = {This paper explores ways in which first generation migrants living in a

   data with 23 participants, all born overseas, with a diverse mix in
   terms of age (young adults to older retired people), gender, country of
   origin and length of time resident in the United Kingdom. The analysis
   focuses on three areas: multisensory engagements with weather, care for
   nature and how transnational identities surface through the relational
   dimensions of nature narratives. We conclude by highlighting the
   potential of embodied nature engagement to support a sense of wellbeing
   and transnational identity across the life-course, with potential to
   more broadly reflect pluralist understandings of the urban environment.},

   novemcinctus) in a Suburban Environment},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The geographic range of the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus)
   has rapidly been expanding within the United States for the last 150
   years. One of the factors contributing to this astounding range
   expansion is the species' ability to survive in and colonize
   human-dominated areas. Despite the fact that armadillos live alongside
   humans in numerous towns and cities across the Southeastern,
   Southcentral, and now Midwestern United States, we know relatively
   little about the behavior and ecology of armadillos in human-developed
   areas. Here, we used motion-triggered game cameras in over 115
   residential yards in the rapidly developing Northwest corner of Arkansas
   to survey armadillos in a largely suburban environment. Our objectives
   were to explore trends in armadillo occupancy and daily activity
   patterns in a suburban setting. We documented armadillos in
   approximately 84\% of the yards surveyed indicating that the species was
   widespread throughout the environment. We found that the species was
   more likely to occupy yards surrounded by a high proportion of forest
   cover. We found no relationship between armadillo occupancy and other
   land cover or development covariates. Only 2\% of nearly 2000 armadillo
   detections occurred during the day indicating that the species is almost
   exclusively nocturnal during the summer months when living near humans
   in the suburban environment, which we suggest is likely an adaptation to
   avoid contact with humans and their dogs. As the armadillo continues to
   expand its geographic range to areas where it has not previously
   occurred, understanding how human development supports and facilitates
   the spread of this species can elucidate areas where conflict between
   humans and armadillos might occur allowing for preemptive management or
   education to mitigate conflict.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Many species have become locally extinct because of
   urbanization. However, many thrive in urban areas because they
   originally have, or they have acquired, features that enable them to
   exploit urban areas. We studied the ecology of the urban yellow
   mongoose, a recent urban dweller in parts of South Africa. We
   investigated the diet, space use and activity habits of yellow
   mongooses, and whether they exploit residential gardens. Similar to
   their non-urban counterparts, yellow mongooses in urban areas fed on
   insects, particularly in spring/summer. The presence of human food
   items, small mammals and birds in scats increased during autumn/winter,
   when insects are known to be less abundant. Camera trap footage revealed
   that, similar to their non-urban counterparts, yellow mongooses in urban
   areas were more prevalent in open habitats, and showed an early morning,
   late afternoon diurnal activity pattern. These urban mongooses were more
   frequently near human residences than at sites further away. Their home
   range size was considerably smaller than that of non-urban mongooses and
   overlapped more with human residents during autumn/winter than during
   spring/summer. Overall, the urban yellow mongooses displayed
   characteristics similar to non-urban mongooses, particularly in their
   diet, habitat use and activity patterns. Yet, they modified their diet
   by including human food, occurred in gardens, and had smaller home
   ranges, indicating modifications for urban life. Several species are
   negatively impacted by urbanization, while others thrive in urban areas
   by exploiting anthropogenic habitats matching their pre-existing niche
   preferences, or by modifying their behavior for urban life. We studied
   the ecology of a recent urban resident, the yellow mongoose, in an urban
   ecological estate in South Africa. We assessed urban dwelling yellow
   mongooses' diet, spatial and temporal occurrence, home range size, and
   whenever possible, compared our findings to the published literature on
   their non-urban conspecifics. Additionally, we evaluated occurrence
   overlap with residential gardens. Similar to their non-urban
   counterparts, scat analyses revealed that yellow mongooses in urban
   areas fed mainly on insects, particularly during spring/summer. In the
   colder months, anthropogenic items, small mammals and birds in scats
   increased. Camera trap surveys showed that the mongooses were common in
   open habitats, similar to previous studies, and exhibited a
   species-typical bimodal diurnal activity pattern. The occurrence of
   these mongooses was greater near human residences than at sites further
   away. Home range sizes were considerably smaller than those of non-urban
   mongoose. Mongoose occurred in residential gardens, more so during the
   colder months. The urban yellow mongooses' diet, habitat preference and
   activity patterns were similar to non-urban conspecifics. Nonetheless,
   the exploitation of anthropogenic food sources, occurrence in
   residential gardens and smaller home range sizes showed that they
   respond flexibly to urbanization, and these modifications might aid in
   their success in urban areas.},

Abstract = {A large database collated by bird watchers was analysed to determine
   whether birds living in the urban habitats of Sydney, Australia could be
   characterised as a discrete community differing from those occupying a
   variety of nearby native habitats. Standardised surveys at fixed
   distances from nine remnants of one native habitat (woodland/scrub on
   Hawkesbury sandstone) were then conducted to determine whether size of,
   and distance to, remnants of native habitat influenced the composition
   of the surrounding suburban bird community. Non-metric multidimensional
   scaling did not separate the bird community of urban parks and gardens
   from those occupying residential areas. However, analysis of similarity
   showed that these communities were significantly different from the bird
   communities of each of the native habitats. Suburban habitats could be
   differentiated by the prevalence of exotic species as well as parrots,
   large honeyeaters, and large birds incorporating vertebrate foods in
   their diet, and a relative rarity of small insectivores and honeyeaters.
   Nearby remnant vegetation had little effect on the bird community
   inhabiting suburban areas. No significant effects of remnant size or
   remnant proximity were detected for species richness, individual
   abundance or community composition. These results suggest that there is
   little overlap in use of urban and remnant habitats by the majority of
   species and that in order to increase bird diversity, urban habitats
   must provide a fuller complement of ecological requirements. (C) 2003

Title = {Psychosocial outcomes as motivations for urban gardening: A
   cross-cultural comparison of Swiss and Chilean gardeners},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {52},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The range of benefits provided by urban greenspaces is reasonably well
   understood and a broad consensus has been reached that they provide
   habitats along with social ecosystem services, such as restoration,
   health and food. Domestic gardens, which are a primary node of contact
   between city residents and nature, typically represent a significant
   portion of the urban greenspaces, so the gardeners who manage them play
   an important role in maintaining the greenspaces within a city. In this
   way, gardeners voluntarily provide a public service so should be
   encouraged, but the motivations of individual gardeners have not been
   sufficiently studied. In this study, we address this research gap by
   using a 14 item `motivations for gardening' scale to evaluate the
   motivations for gardening held by gardeners in different cultural
   contexts. We used questionnaires to collect data in three Swiss cities
   (Lausanne, Bern and Zurich; N = 409) and one Chilean city (Temuco; N =
   167) and analysed the responses at both item and scale levels. Although
   significant differences between Swiss and Chilean responses were found
   for all individual scale items, a principal component analysis revealed
   nearly identical component structures for both the Swiss and Chilean
   samples. Three clear components were identified; restoration as the
   motivational component receiving the strongest agreement, followed by
   socialization, and then food production. Nearly identical component
   structures were found, with the same scale items loading against the
   same components, when the sample was divided according to age, gender,
   education and income. These results suggest that motivations for
   gardening are not context dependant but rather represent an inherent
   human condition that frames how gardeners manage and interact with their
   gardens. Acknowledgement of these human needs: especially regarding the
   restoration benefits that people gain from these spaces, in public
   policies related to management and regulation of green urban areas has
   the potential to contribute to the survival of urban gardens.},

   a case study of Dezful City in Iran},
Journal = {NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {56},
Pages = {127-149},
Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {Allotment (AGs) and community gardens (CGs) are types of urban gardens
   that provide diverse ecosystem services (ESs) such as climate
   regulation, beautiful landscapes, biodiversity and food security.
   Despite this, there are no AGs or CGs in many developing countries such
   as Iran. One of the main reasons for the lack of development of CGs in
   developing countries is the lack of proper understanding by
   policy-makers and citizens regarding the economic value of the ESs
   provided and the lack of disclosure of the benefits of its construction
   in urban areas. The purpose of this study is to analyse the preferences
   of citizens, to examine the existence of a potential market, to estimate
   the willingness to pay (WTP) for the creation and operation of CG
   services and to investigate the factors affecting residents' WTP in
   Dezful, Iran. For this purpose, a choice experiment, based on the stated
   preferences valuation approach, was applied through interviews with 170
   respondents living in Dezful urban area. The data were collected during
   the autumn of 2022 and analysed using conditional logit model. The
   results indicated that the responding citizens are willing to pay 4.57
   USD per month to create CG and operate its ESs in Dezful. Amongst the
   attributes and ESs of the community garden, citizens valued cultural
   services the most, followed by provisioning services. In addition, the
   variables ``age{''}, ``being native{''}, ``education{''}, ``household
   expenditure level{''} and ``awareness and recognition of CG ecosystem
   services{''} had a significant effect on WTP. According to the results,
   it is suggested to follow the policy of creating CGs with the
   participation of citizens instead of focusing only on the creation of
   urban green space with a government budget and heavy financial burden.
   CGs, while providing diverse ESs, can generate sustainable incomes for
   municipalities and accelerate the movement toward sustainable urban
   development.},

   compounds, the common metabolites of the OP pesticides. Through parental
   interviews we gathered demographic and residential pesticide use data.
   At least one of the DAP metabolites was measured in 99\% of the
   children, and the two predominant metabolites (DMTP and DETP) were
   measured in 70-75\% of the children. We found no significant differences
   in DAP concentrations related to season, community, sex, age, family
   income, or housing type. Median concentrations of dimethyl and diethyl
   DAPs were 0.11 and 0.04 mu mol/L, respectively (all children).
   Concentrations were significantly higher in children whose parents
   reported pesticide use in the garden (0.19 vs. 0.09 mu mol/L For
   dimethyl metabolites, p = 0.05; 0.04 vs. 0.03 mu mol/L for diethyl
   metabolites, p = 0.02), but were not different based on reported pet
   treatment or indoor residential use. Nearly all children in this study
   had measurable levels of OP pesticide metabolites. Some of this exposure
   was likely due to diet. Garden pesticide use was associated with
   elevated metabolite levels. It is unlikely that these exposure levels
   would cause acute intoxication, but the longterm health effects of such
   exposures are unknown. We recommend that OP pesticide use be avoided in
   areas where children are likely to play.},

Title = {Grappling with `Nature' in Australian Home Gardens 1890-1960},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND HISTORY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-38},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The period from 1890 to 1960 in Australia, as elsewhere, is widely
   acknowledged as pivotal in the development of modernity, involving
   increasing urbanisation, commodification, nationalism, state power,
   bureaucratisation, occupational specialisation, technocratic thinking
   and faith in science. This era ushered in a vastly expanded state
   infrastructure for environmental management, and saw the rise and fall
   of progressive conservation activism, as well as precursors to the
   popular environmentalism emerging in the 1960s. Little, however, is
   known of how typical middle-and working-class residents of Australian
   cities and towns understood nature in this period, and how their
   understandings may have changed in the face of such far-reaching
   developments. A focus on relationships between people, plants and
   invertebrates in home garden settings provides one window onto this
   issue, providing evidence of how those who gardened negotiated a more or
   less self-conscious engagement with `nature' in a domestic setting.
   Close examination of texts produced by and for gardeners suggests that
   while the dominant social construction of the relationship between
   nature and humans increasingly emphasised human autonomy and control,
   the embodied experience of home gardening gave rise to diverse
   understandings. The sense of control and independence that many
   gardeners had come to expect by the 1950s was challenged by the enduring
   autonomy of nature, and many gardeners accepted the limitations of their
   control. Home gardening thus both reflected and challenged prevailing
   modernist ideas about emancipation from nature.},

Title = {When Does an Alien Become a Native Species? A Vulnerable Native Mammal
   Recognizes and Responds to Its Long-Term Alien Predator},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The impact of alien predators on native prey populations is often
   attributed to prey naivete `towards a novel threat. Yet evolutionary
   theory predicts that alien predators cannot remain eternally novel; prey
   species must either become extinct or learn and adapt to the new threat.
   As local enemies lose their naivete' and coexistence becomes possible,
   an introduced species must eventually become `native'. But when exactly
   does an alien become a native species? The dingo (Canis lupus dingo) was
   introduced to Australia about 4000 years ago, yet its native status
   remains disputed. To determine whether a vulnerable native mammal
   (Perameles nasuta) recognizes the close relative of the dingo, the
   domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), we surveyed local residents to
   determine levels of bandicoot visitation to yards with and without
   resident dogs. Bandicoots in this area regularly emerge from bushland to
   forage in residential yards at night, leaving behind tell-tale deep,
   conical diggings in lawns and garden beds. These diggings were less
   likely to appear at all, and appeared less frequently and in smaller
   quantities in yards with dogs than in yards with either resident cats
   (Felis catus) or no pets. Most dogs were kept indoors at night, meaning
   that bandicoots were not simply chased out of the yards or killed before
   they could leave diggings, but rather they recognized the threat posed
   by dogs and avoided those yards. Native Australian mammals have had
   thousands of years experience with wild dingoes, which are very closely
   related to domestic dogs. Our study suggests that these bandicoots may
   no longer be naive towards dogs. We argue that the logical criterion for
   determining native status of a long-term alien species must be once its
   native enemies are no longer naive.},

Title = {How can residents protect and promote pollinators? The diffusion of
   residential pollinator-friendly gardening},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {345},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Urbanization and land use change are leading causes of declines in
   pollinator abundance and diversity. However, researchers in different
   regions of the world have found that some pollinators can thrive in
   urban landscapes, depending on land use practices, environmental
   conditions, and species traits. Residential landscapes constitute a
   significant portion of urban green space and thus, residents' adoption
   of landscape practices to promote pollinators can play a central role in
   addressing the global pollinator challenge. Yet, although residents'
   willingness and intention appear strong, adoption of pollinator-friendly
   gardening remains low. The present study - guided by the Diffusion of
   Innovations theory - aimed to build empirical understanding by surveying
   1598 Florida residents on their experiences and perceptions related to
   pollinator-friendly gardening to determine the most salient barriers and
   opportunities to engagement. Key findings suggest making the practice
   more widely observable and reducing perceived complexity in learning to
   do the practice are critical to promoting adoption. This demonstrates,
   in practical terms, that: (1) targeted efforts to build residents'
   actionable knowledge about pollinator-friendly gardening may
   significantly reduce uncertainty and boost the likelihood of adoption;
   and (2) examples of active pollinator gardens need to be more widely
   showcased and popularized (e.g., through experiential or virtual
   demonstrations). We also found most residents living in homeowner
   associations (HOAs) believed HOA policies on pollinator-friendly
   gardening were restrictive or the residents were unsure whether they are
   allowed to practice pollinator-friendly gardening. Given these
   perceptions strongly associated with residents' low intent to engage in
   pollinator-friendly gardening, a major opportunity exists to diffuse the
   practice and increase adoption by working with HOAs and community
   leaders to become promoters of - rather than barriers to -
   pollinator-friendly gardening.},

Title = {Ethnobotanical biocultural diversity by rural communities in the
   Cuatrocienegas Valley, Coahuila; Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 29},
Abstract = {Background Cuatrocienegas, part of the Chihuahuan Desert, is a region of
   unique biological, geological, geographical, and evolutionary
   importance. Its current population is mestizo; nevertheless, it has high
   national historical, cultural, and touristic relevance in Mexico. It has
   been cataloged as nationally significant for its flora and fauna by
   Mexican law, as well as being designated a High Protection site by the
   World Wildlife Fund and UNESCO. Because of its diverse and complex
   biological and sociocultural characteristics, we considered it important
   to determine, identify, and analyze various aspects of the traditional
   ethnobotanical knowledge and practices in this region. Methods Between
   2016 and 2019, seven field trips were made to document the knowledge and
   use of flora. Cuatrocienegas is a protected area, collecting botanical
   material is regulated, so specimens were photographed and collected in
   neighboring communities, and in public and private gardens. Later
   permission was obtained to complete the collection of specimens
   (2019-2020). The plants were identified and entered into the flora
   database of the state of Coahuila, and deposited in the Herbarium of the
   Faculty of Forest Sciences, Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, Mexico.
   One hundred ten local residents (50 men and 60 women), aged between 27
   and 91 years, were interviewed (semi-structured interviews). The
   cultural importance of ethnobotanical resources (cultural significance
   index) and its significance with respect to ethnobotanical richness in
   other Biosphere Reserves in Mexico (Mann-Whitney test), and similarities
   in the diversity of exotic species (Sorensen index) were studied.
   Results and discussion The ethnobotanical information registers 158
   species and 132 genera in 57 vascular and non-vascular families,
   documenting a greater knowledge and use of cultivated species (84) with
   respect to wild species (74). The diversity of plants reported is
   compared to other ethnobotanical studies carried out in Mexican
   Biosphere Reserves. These results are highly relevant, in spite of
   unique exotic species. The people local pay special attention to
   medicinal and ornamental plants. The species that presented the highest
   use values are Larrea tridentata, Jatropha dioica, and Machaeranthera
   pinnatifida, three species characteristic of the desert region.
   Conclusions The particular diversity of wild flora in Cuatrocienegas
   Valley, combined with the varied introduced flora, is an important
   multifunctional resource. Special attention to introduced species is
   associated with harvesting use restrictions in the protected area as
   well as the high value of ornamental species that are difficult to
   maintain in desert areas. The extensive use of ethnobotanical knowledge
   is an example that biocultural diversity (at the conceptual level) is
   also strongly associated with socio-ecological systems incorporating
   mestizo groups and semi-urban rural landscapes, thus ceasing to be an
   exclusive focus of indigenous communities and regions.},

Abstract = {We investigated seed dispersal phenology of bird-dispersed and
   encroaching woody species in the Free State National Botanical Garden
   (FSNBG), South Africa, over a 12-month period. Results from defecated
   seeds' collection in 17 roosting sites show that a total of 22,161 seeds
   belonging to 14 woody species under 11 families were eaten and dispersed
   by foraging birds with seeds of six species being frequently dispersed.
   The native species had a larger number of dispersed bird-ingested seeds
   than the alien and invasive species. Seeds' collection suggested that
   out of five fruiting species, birds mostly preferred the red (Ziziphus
   mucronata, Ehretia rigida and Viscum rotundifolium) and black fruits
   (Olea europaea subsp. africana and Diospyros lyciodes). Ziziphus
   mucronata and O. subsp. africana seeds were dispersed in significantly
   higher numbers between March and July (mean +/- SE: 47.1 +/- 11.6; 51.4
   +/- 9.0), while Searsia lancea and E. rigida were mostly dispersed
   between August and December (221.6 +/- 74.1; 373.6 +/- 91.5)-a dichotomy
   that could minimise competition for dispersal agents while sustaining
   the resident bird species. Over 480 h of camera trapping, 22 bird
   species were captured, of which seven displayed high foraging frequency,
   and were resident in behaviour, while six species were migratory and
   colonial avian frugivores, including two alien bird species. We conclude
   that the reported bush encroachment is a likely result of high propagule
   pressure by resident frugivorous birds and colonial wintering birds in
   FSNBG, together with low fruit diversity in the grassland habitat.},

   survival of the Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis)},
Journal = {AVIAN BIOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {92-99},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Resource availability, particularly food, can limit the size of bird
   populations during the nonbreeding season. Resident and short-distance
   migrant birds, wintering in colder environments, should show strong
   effects of food limitation on winter survival. Here, we introduce a
   novel experiment testing for the effect of supplemental feeding on the
   winter survival of the Dark-eyed Junco (junco hyemalis), a short- to
   medium-distance migrant in North America. Color-ringed juncos were
   monitored by resighting in the winters of 2011, 2012, and 2013. Winter
   supplemental feeding significantly increased junco survival within
   winters. However, it is possible that juncos not resighted underwent
   within-winter dispersal rather than died. Thus, in the winter of 2014,
   very high frequency radio transmitters were attached to 29 juncos from
   unsupplemented sites to ascertain the fate of birds not resighted. We
   found that movement beyond the study area was minimal and most juncos
   maintained a discrete home range. Of the radiotagged birds, 27.5\% were
   not resighted during observation periods, but were located and confirmed
   alive via radiotracking. A correction factor for within-winter dispersal
   was applied to previous years' data and the effect of food
   supplementation remained statistically significant for two of the three
   winters; the trend was the same, but not statistically significant
   during the warmest winter. The present results contribute to a
   developing conceptual model of migration-specific effects of winter food
   limitation. Dark-eyed Juncos are an iconic backyard birdfeeder species
   that have shown a steady population decline for decades. Supplemental
   feeding during the wintering period may regularly elevate population
   recruitment by increasing winter survival in avian species that winter
   in thermally challenging environments.},

Title = {Native and exotic woody vegetation communities in domestic gardens in
   relation to social and environmental factors},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Vegetation in private gardens contributes significantly to plant species
   richness and vegetation volume across urban areas. Drivers of garden
   diversity and structure are complex, reflecting the diversity of social,
   cultural, and socioeconomic characteristics of the householders who
   manage their gardens, as well as their predecessors. Here we investigate
   the woodiness of gardens, and focus on (1) the prevalence of native
   versus exotic woody plants and (2) the influence of characteristics of
   garden owners, the gardens, and their proximity to neighborhood green
   spaces to identify the degree to which these factors explain patterns in
   native and exotic woody species communities in entire (back and front)
   gardens in southern temperate New Zealand. We found few consistent
   patterns in structure in woody species community composition. Outlying
   gardens were characterized by low species richness and abundance.
   Thirty-seven species commonly occurred across most gardens: most of
   these were exotic. Twelve native species were common throughout most
   gardens. There was significant but weak matching to social and
   environmental variables: vegetated area, species knowledge, and
   education explained pattern in native communities, whereas vegetated
   area, species knowledge, and householder age explained variation in
   exotic communities. Native trees >5 m tall occurred in only 58\% of
   gardens. Tall tree density was 10/ha, and 29\% of gardens lacked any
   trees >5 m. Tree presence was weakly (positively) associated with extent
   and proximity of neighborhood green space. We suggest that the legacy of
   previous owners' gardening practices is important to consider when
   identifying drivers of garden plant community structure.},

   completed both baseline and post-trial questionnaires, including 127
   participants with backyard pig farms. Significant improvements were
   found in KAP towards antibiotic use in humans, but changes related to
   antibiotic use for pigs were not significant. Participants who were in
   the intervention group (p < 0.001) were more likely to have improved
   their knowledge on antibiotic use in humans. Participants who had higher
   attitude scores were less likely to report self-medicating with stored

Abstract = {Peridomestic ({''}backyard{''}) chicken flocks are gaining popularity in
   the developed world (e.g., North America or Europe), yet little is known
   regarding prevalence or severity of their ectoparasites. Therefore, five
   birds on each of 20 properties throughout southern California were
   surveyed in summer for on-host (permanent) and off-host dwelling
   (temporary) ectoparasites. Only four premises (20\%) were entirely free
   of ectoparasites. In declining order of prevalence (\% of premises),
   permanent ectoparasites included six chicken louse species: Menacanthus

   Lipeurus caponis (L.) (20\%), Menopon gallinae (L.) (15\%), Menacanthus
   cornutus (Schommer) (5\%), and Cuclotogaster heterographus (Nitzsch)
   (5\%). Only one flea species, Echidnophaga gallinacea (Westwood) (20\%),
   was found. Three parasitic mite species were observed: Ornithonyssus
   sylviarum (Canestrini \& Fanzago) (15\%), Knemidocoptes mutans (Robin \&
   Lanquetin) (10\%), and Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer) (5\%). Many
   infestations consisted of a few to a dozen individuals per bird, but M.
   stramineus, G. gallinae, M. cornutus, and E. gallinacea were abundant
   (dozens to hundreds of individuals) on some birds, and damage by K.
   mutans was severe on two premises. Off-host dwelling ectoparasites were
   rare (D. gallinae) or absent (Cimex lectularius L., Argasidae). Parasite
   diversity in peridomestic flocks greatly exceeds that is routinely
   observed on commercial chicken flocks and highlights a need for
   increased biosecurity and development of ectoparasite control options
   for homeowners.},

Abstract = {Capsule Bird species richness showed consistent positive correlations
   with site area and rough grass.
   Aim To determine those features of parks and other public green spaces
   that are of most importance in promoting bird species richness and to
   use this information to make recommendations for management of these
   areas.
   Methods Birds were counted in parks and other public green spaces within
   Greater London. Three survey visits were made in each of the periods
   summer 2002 and 2003 and winter 2002/03 and 2003/04. Habitat data were
   also collected.
   Results Site area was the most consistently significant variable related
   (positively) to total species richness. There were also positive effects
   of waterbodies and rough grass (including nettles and weed-rich areas).
   Species richness increased with a greater proportion of adjacent gardens
   in sites < 1 ha in size. There were negative associations with the
   presence of buildings. When considered by species group (woodland
   species, farmland species and habitat generalists), results were very
   similar to those for total species richness, except that there were no
   significant associations with presence of waterbodies.
   Conclusion Bird species richness is likely to be enhanced by increasing
   site area, and providing rough gross and waterbodies in urban green
   spaces. Such information could be especially useful in designing green
   spaces in new residential developments to maximize avian diversity.
   Surrounding habitats are also crucial determinants of bird species
   richness in parks.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have revealed several examples of intimate associations
   between insects and Actinobacteria, including the Southern Pine Beetle
   Dendroctonus frontalis and the Spruce Beetle Dendroctonus rufipennis.
   Here, we surveyed Streptomyces Actinobacteria co-occurring with 10
   species of Dendroctonus bark beetles across the United States, using
   both phylogenetic and community ecology approaches. From these 10
   species, and 19 other scolytine beetles that occur in the same trees, we
   obtained 154 Streptomyces-like isolates and generated 16S sequences from
   134 of those. Confirmed 16S sequences of Streptomyces were binned into
   36 distinct strains using a threshold of 0.2\% sequence divergence. The
   16S rDNA phylogeny of all isolates does not correlate with the
   distribution of strains among beetle species, localities, or parts of
   the beetles or their galleries. However, we identified three
   Streptomyces strains occurring repeatedly on Dendroctonus beetles and in
   their galleries. Identity of these isolates was corroborated using a
   house-keeping gene sequence (efTu). These strains are not confined to a
   certain species of beetle, locality, or part of the beetle or their
   galleries. However, their role as residents in the woodboring insect
   niche is supported by the repeated association of their 16S and efTu
   from across the continent, and also having been reported in studies of
   other subcortical insects.},

Volume = {140},
Number = {3-4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In South-East Asia patterns of forest loss can predict the number of
   threatened birds. on the oceanic islands of Wallacea, small-scale
   agriculture, rather than commercial logging, is the main cause of forest
   loss and conversion, but few studies have directly examined their
   responses to land use. In 2001, 1 studied the birds of primary forest
   and anthropogenic gardens on the well-forested, and remote, Damar Island
   (198 km(2)) in the Banda Sea. Furthermore, I examined broad changes to
   the islands bird fauna by comparing baseline bird lists obtained in the
   19th century with 2001 data. The conversion of primary forest to garden
   resulted in substantial changes in avifaunal composition, and to the
   abundance of individual bird species, particularly to frugivorous and
   globally restricted-range species. Of 15 common birds, four were
   significantly more abundant in primary forest (blue-tailed imperial
   pigeon Ducula concinna, northern fantail Rhipidura rufiventris, golden
   whistler Pachycephala pectotalis and red-chested flowerpecker Dicaeum
   maugei) and one (scaly-breasted honeyeater Lichmera squamata) was more
   abundant in garden habitat. Incidental observations provided further
   evidence that many forest specialists (including the island endemic
   Damar flycatcher Ficedula henrici) rarely, if ever, used garden habitats
   notwithstanding its relative proximity. The number of resident birds
   recorded in 2001 (39) was similar to the 1890s (38), but six
   forest-dependent passe-rines were extirpated between samples. These
   losses are associated with the conversion of 25\% of the primary forest
   to modified habitat since the 1890s, but given the sparse species and
   environmental change data available it is impossible to definitively
   pinpoint this as the only cause underlying the species losses. This
   study demonstrates that remote and relatively well-forested islands are
   not immune to the threatening processes impacting bird populations
   elsewhere in South-East Asia. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {AimThe enemy release hypothesis states that the invasion success of
   non-native species is partly due to their escape from natural enemies,
   e.g., herbivores. Large-scale studies of herbivory using multiple
   species across multiple sites are needed to test the generality of
   herbivory release in non-native plants.LocationEurope.MethodsWe carried
   out leaf-herbivory surveys from 2007 to 2021 in 15 botanical gardens
   ranging in latitude from 47 degrees N (Switzerland) to 63 degrees N
   (Norway) to investigate how herbivory levels differed between (i) native
   and non-native species, and (ii) native and non-naturalised or
   naturalised species.ResultsOverall, we found that herbivory levels were
   lower on non-native than native species. In addition, we found that
   non-naturalised plants suffered less herbivory than natives and that
   naturalised plants showed similar levels of herbivory to native
   plants.Main ConclusionsWe find broad support for lower herbivory of
   non-native plant species compared to natives. However, the stronger
   reduction in herbivory for non-naturalised plants suggests that
   herbivore release may be transient and less pronounced for naturalised
   non-native species that have become abundant and integrated into
   resident communities. This has implications for the management of
   naturalised non-native plants, which are performing well in their
   non-native ranges despite suffering comparable herbivory levels to
   native species.},

Abstract = {The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is showing population declines in
   many parts of Europe, with recent declines being particularly severe in
   urban areas. To date, relatively little is known about the species'
   habitat associations within urbanized landscapes. We report here an
   investigation of the habitat associations of house sparrows using a
   survey of 1223 stratified randomly selected 500 x 500-m squares within
   urbanized landscapes of the UK, defined as at least 25\% ``human cover'.
   The densities of chirping male house sparrows and of all house sparrows
   were analysed separately to obtain insights into breeding habitat
   requirements and general habitat associations, respectively. Multi-model
   inference showed that residential areas (houses, flats), allotments
   (areas used for small-scale horticulture) and farm buildings were key
   predictors of house sparrow density and chirping male density. Separate
   analyses on landscapes of differing human cover showed similar results.
   Within residential areas, the increase of house sparrow density with
   habitat area (on a log scale) was approximately threefold greater when
   private gardens were present than when they were absent. The model
   predicted a rapid decline in house sparrow abundance when only a small
   area of private gardens is converted to continuous housing. Allotments
   and residential areas with gardens are likely to be under pressure due
   to increased demand for housing, specifically from the infilling of
   green space within urban areas. It would seem to be imperative that any
   action plan to protect urban house sparrow populations should include
   specific protection of such key habitats.},

Abstract = {Mexico has shown an increase in dengue incidence rates. There are
   factors related to the location that determine housing infestation by
   Aedes. This study aimed to determine factors associated with housing
   infestation by immature forms of Aedes spp. in the dengue endemic
   localities of Axochiapan and Tepalcingo, Mexico, from 2014 to 2016. A
   cohort study was carried out. Surveys and inspections of front- and
   backyards were conducted every 6 months, looking for immature forms of
   Aedes spp. A house condition scoring scale was developed using three
   variables (house maintenance, tidiness of the front- and backyards, and
   shading of the front- and backyards). Multiple and multilevel regression
   logistic analysis were conducted considering the housing infestation as
   the outcome and the household characteristics observed 6 months before
   the outcome as factors; this was adjusted by time (seasonal and cyclical
   variations of the vector). The infestation oscillated between 5.8\% of
   the houses in the second semester of 2015 and 29.3\% in the second
   semester of 2016. The factors directly associated with housing
   infestation by Aedes were the house condition score (adjusted odds ratio
   {[}aOR]: 1.64; 95\% CI: 1.40-1.91) and the previous record of housing
   infestation (aOR: 2.99; 95\% CI: 2.00-4.48). Moreover, the breeding-site
   elimination done by house residents reduced the housing infestation odds
   by 81\% (95\% CI: 25-95\%). These factors were independent of the
   seasonal and cyclical variations of the vector. In conclusion, our
   findings could help to focalize antivectorial interventions in
   dengue-endemic regions with similar demographic and socioeconomic
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to describe the residential use of insecticides in a
   birth cohort in Spain. Study subjects were 2 456 women enrolled into the
   INMA (Environment and Childhood) birth cohort followed prospectively
   during pregnancy and in the early postnatal period. The women were
   recruited at the beginning of their pregnancy between 2003 and 2008 in
   four regions of Spain. Socio-demographic, environmental and lifestyle
   information was obtained at two interviews during pregnancy, one at the
   first (mean:13.8 +/- 2.6 weeks of gestation) and the other at the third
   trimester (mean: 33.3 +/- 23 weeks of gestation). Information about
   prenatal use of indoor and outdoor insecticides (type, timing, place of
   application, place of storage) was obtained from the second interview.
   In a 3rd interview (mean: 16.2 +/- 6.9 months of age of children),
   information about postnatal indoor and outdoor insecticide use was
   obtained. Regression models examined the association between demographic
   and lifestyle factors and pesticide use to determine which
   characteristics predicted use prenatally and postnatally. Fifty-four
   percent of women reported using indoor insecticides during pregnancy,
   45\% in their bedroom and 47\% elsewhere in the house. Plug-in devices
   were the most frequent application methods used in the pregnant woman's
   bedroom and insecticide sprays elsewhere in the house. The maternal
   factors related to prenatal use of indoor insecticides were parity,
   country of birth, educational level, region of residence, having a
   garden or yard with plants, and living near an agricultural area. These
   products continued to be used postnatally, although 20\% of the women
   stopped using them. Foetuses and children are especially vulnerable to
   pesticide exposure; thus knowing how pesticides are used during
   pregnancy and infancy may be a starting point for the study of their
   potential effects on health as well as useful for designing preventive
   actions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have linked non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with
   occupational exposure to insecticides, but residential use is largely
   unexplored. In this population-based case-control study, we examined NHL
   risk and use of insecticides in the home and garden. We identified NHL
   cases, uninfected with HIV, diagnosed between 1998 and 2000 among women
   and men ages 20 to 74 years in Iowa and the metropolitan areas of Los
   Angeles, Detroit, and Seattle. Controls were selected using random digit
   dialing or Medicare files. Computer-assisted personal interviews (1,321
   cases and 1,057 controls) elicited data on insecticide use at each home
   occupied since 1970. Insecticide levels were measured in dust taken from
   used vacuum cleaner bags (682 cases and 513 controls). We previously
   reported a positive association with dichtorodiphenyldichloroethylene
   levels in carpet dust residues. Here, we focus on insecticides
   Introduction that were commonly used after 1970, the time period covered
   by our questionnaire. People whose homes were treated for termites had
   elevated NHL risk (odds ratio, 1.3; 95\% confidence interval, 1.0-1.6).
   Risk was modestly, although not significantly, elevated in all but one
   study center and in all sexes and races. The elevation in risk was
   restricted to people whose homes were treated before the 1988 chlordane
   ban. There was a significant trend of increasing risk with increasing
   levels of alpha-chlordane residues in dust (P-trend = 0.04) and a
   marginally significant trend for gamma-chlordane (P-trend = 0.06). We
   found no evidence of associations for insects overall, for specific
   types of insects other than termites, or for elevated residues of other
   insecticides. We concluded that chlordane treatment of homes for
   termites may increase residents' NHL risk.},

   communities from south Spain},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background. Despite the widespread use of organophosphate (OP)
   pesticides, information on predictors of children's exposure to such
   pesticides is scarce. Objective. To assess exposure to OP pesticides in
   children 3-11 year-old living in agricultural communities and urban
   areas from Andalusia (Southern Spain), and to identify the main
   determinants of exposure.
   Methods. A longitudinal study was conducted in children 3-11-year-old
   children living in agricultural communities and urban areas from the
   provinces of Almeria, Granada and Huelva (Andalusia, Spain) between 2010
   and 2011. Urinary levels of six dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites were
   measured by UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS at the periods of low and high pesticide use
   in the agriculture (LPU and HPU, respectively). Information on
   sociodemographic characteristics, parental occupation, residential
   history, lifestyle and diet, among other relevant factors, was obtained
   from questionnaires administered to the mothers.
   Results. A total of 559 and 597 children participated in LPU and HPU
   periods, respectively. The proportion of urine samples below LOD was
   67.4\% for Sigma DMs (sum of dimethyl metabolites), 77\% for Sigma DEs
   (sum of diethyl metabolites) and 58.5\% for Sigma DAPs (sum of total
   dialkylphosphate metabolites) in LPU period, and 50.4\% for Sigma DMs,
   65.3\% for Sigma DEs and 43.9\% for Sigma DAPs in HPU period.
   Significantly greater urinary Sigma DAP, Sigma DM and Sigma DE levels
   were observed in HPU relative to LPU period. Maternal schooling years,
   proximity of the house to crops or greenhouses, use of insecticides at
   home, spraying the garden with pesticides, storage of pesticides at
   home, house cleaning frequency, as well as child's frequency of
   bath/shower, were found to be the major predictors of urinary levels of
   Sigma DAP. Likewise, not washing fruit and vegetables before consumption
   and banana consumption were also identified as determinants of the
   exposure levels.
   Conclusions. Urinary levels of metabolites of OP pesticides found in
   this study were relatively lower compared to similar studies. DAP levels
   were significantly increased in HPU period. Maternal schooling years and
   variables related to residential environment and home exposures were
   identified as the most relevant determinants of DAP metabolites.
   Regarding diet, banana consumption and not washing fruit before
   consumption were also identified as determinants of the exposure levels.
   This study contributes to improve our knowledge on the main sources and
   determinants of children exposure to OPS, and given that children are
   more vulnerable than adults this information is essential to reduce
   children exposure and protect their health.},
